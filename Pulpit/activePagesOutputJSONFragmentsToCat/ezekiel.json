"Ezek.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - Then I looked, etc. There follows on the work of judgment another theophany, like that of Ezekiel 1:15-28. In the \"expanse,\" or firmament, like the \"terrible crystal,\" there is seen as before the likeness of a sapphire throne (see Ezekiel 1:26, note). The form of the man who is the manifestation of Jehovah is implied, though not named. It is he who speaks to the captain of the six ministers of vengeance, himself the seventh, and bids him go in beneath the \"whirling wheels\" that are beneath the cherub (collective singular, as in Ezekiel 9:9), and fill his hands with coals of fire (Ezekiel 1:13), and scatter them over the city, as the symbol of its doom. We are reminded of Isaiah's vision (Isaiah 6:6); but there the work of the fire was to purify, here simply to destroy. Vers 3, 4. - Now the cherubim stood, etc. The position of the cherubim is defined, with a vivid distinctness of detail, which once more reminds us of Dante. They had been standing on the right, i.e. the southern side of the sanctuary. What follows is probably a reproduction of the change of positions described in Ezekiel 9:3, and the verbs should be taken, therefore, as pluperfects. The cloud of glory, as in 1 Kings 8:10, 11 and Isaiah 6:1, 2, the Shechinah, that was the taken of the Divine presence, filled the court, but the glory itself had moved to the threshold at the first stage of its departure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - And the sound of the cherubim. The use of God Almighty (El Shaddai; comp. Exodus 6:3), the name of God as ruling over nature, while Jehovah expressed his covenant relationship to Israel, is, it may be noted, characteristic of the early stage of the religion of Israel (Genesis 17:1; Genesis 28:3; Genesis 43:14; Genesis 48:3). Shaddai alone appears eighty-one times in the Book of Job. Psalm 29. explains the voice of El Shaddai (though there it is \"the voice of Jehovah\") as meaning the roar of the thunder. The hands of the \"living creatures,\" now recognized as cherubim, had been mentioned in Ezekiel 1:8, and it is one of those hands that gives the fire into the hands of the linen vested minister of wrath. The elemental forces of nature, of which the cherubim are, partly at least, the symbols, are working out the purposes of Jehovah. The two words translated wheels are different in the Hebrew. The first is singular and collective (galgal, the \"whirling thing,\" used of the wheel of a war chariot, Ezekiel 23:24; Isaiah 5:28), and might well be translated \"chariot\" here. The second, that used in Ezekiel 1:15, 16, also in the singular, is applied to the single wheel of the four by which the angel, ministers stood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The description of the theophany that follows, though essentially identical with that in ch. 1 is not a literal transcript of it. The prophet struggles, as before, to relate what he has actually seen in the visions of God. The fact is stated as explaining the mention of the \"hand\" in ver. 7. That, as in Ezekiel 1:8, was one of their members (see notes on Ezekiel 1:15-17). All that had seemed most startling and awful to him on the banks of Chebar is now seen again - the four living creatures, now named cherubim the wheel by each, the unswerving motion of the wheels in their onward course.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Whither the head, etc. The word has been taken, as in Job 29:25, for the \"chief\" or \"principal\" wheel, that which for the time determined the course of the others. With all the complex structure of the cherubic chariot, all was simple in its action. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels, and that gave unity (Ezekiel 1:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And their whole body. Here there is distinctly a new feature. In Ezekiel 1:18 the \"rings\" of the wheels were \"full of eyes.\" Here the eyes are everywhere. It is not hard to interpret this part of the vision. The prophet receives a new impression of the all-seeing eye of Jehovah. Everywhere, as he stands face to face with the forces of nature, he can say, must say, within himself, \"Thou God seest me\" (Genesis 16:13). There is an eye that looks upon him where he least expects it. The same thought appears in the stone with seven eyes in Zechariah 3:9. St. John reproduces it in the same form as Ezekiel, with the exception of the wheels, which form no part of his vision, in Revelation 4:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - As for the wheels, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, they were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels; or better still, to keep the collective force of the singular galgal, the chariot. He recognized that as the right name of the whole mysterious and complex form. It, was nothing less than the chariot throne of the King of the universe. There is no sufficient reason for taking the noun, with the Authorized Version, as a vocative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The first face was the face of a cherub, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, of the cherub. This takes the place of \"the face of an ox\" in Ezekiel 1:10, and it is first in order instead of being, as there, the third. It is as though, in this second vision, he recognizes that this was emphatically the cherubic form. Possibly the article indicates that this was the form that had given the \"coals of fire\" in ver. 7. Each form, we must remember, had the four faces, but the prophet names the face which each presented to him as he gazed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - As he gazes, the recognition is complete. What he sees in the courts of the temple is identical with the living creature by the river of Chebar. It moves as that moved, wheels and wings and cherubim, all as by one harmonious impulse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Then the glory of the Lord, etc. The chariot throne was, as it were, ready for its kingly Rider. The \"glory\"-cloud, or Shechinah. takes its place over them, and the departure begins. From that hour the temple was, in Ezekiel's thoughts, to be, till the time of restoration contemplated in ch. 40-48, what Shiloh had been, a God-deserted place. We arc reminded of the voice which Josephus tells us was heard before the final destruction of the second temple, exclaiming, \"Let us depart hence,\" as the priests were making ready for the Pentecostal feast ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:05. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The departure has the east gate of the Lord's house for its starting point. By that gate, in the later vision of the restored temple, the glory of the Lord was to return (Ezekiel 43:4). For \"every one\" read \"it,\" sc. the galgal, or complex structure of the chariot. The Hebrew verb is in the singular, but, as the italics show, there is no word answering to \"every one.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Once more the prophet asserts, with fresh emphasis, the identity of the two visions which it had been given him to see. Now, as it were, he understands why the first vision was seen as coming from the north. He does not tell us whether the journey of which he saw the beginning was to end. For the present there was a halt, as we learn from Ezekiel 11:23, \"over the midst of the city.\" Even when the vision ended, it had not gone further than the Mount of Olives. We may conjecture, however, that he thought of its goal as that more sacred region of the heavens in which it had at first manifested itself (see note on Ezekiel 1:4). It was, at any rate, no longer in the temple. The banks of Chebar or any other place might become, as Bethel had been to Jacob (Genesis 28:17), as \"the house of God\" and \"the gate of heaven.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, etc. It is noticeable that the position to which Ezekiel was thus transported in his vision from his place in the inner court (Ezekiel 8:14), was identical with that which he had just seen occupied by the cherub chariot before its departure (Ezekiel 10:19). What he is about to see will throw light on the significance of their departure. The gate is probably, here as there, that of the court of the temple. Five and twenty men. The number at first reminds us of the worshippers of the sun, in Ezekiel 8:16; but that, as we saw, was probably a company of priests. On the other hand, the two who are named are styled princes of the people, which suggests a lay rather than a priestly status, and they are seen in a different locality. Conjectures as to the significance of the number vary.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Two from each tribe of Israel, with the king at their head.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Two from each of the twelve divisions of the army, each containing twenty-four thousand men (1 Chronicles 27:1-15).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Representatives of twelve regions of the city - a kind of municipal council, with their president. Possibly, after all, the number was used more or less vaguely - a \"round\" number, as we say (Smend). It is probably safe, however, to think of them as representing the lay element of authority. Nothing is known further as to the persons named. Jaazaniah is distinguished by his parentage from his namesake of Ezekiel 8:11 and Jeremiah 35:3. Both were probably familiar to those for whom Ezekiel wrote, as leaders of the party that was \"always devising mischief,\" in opposition, i.e., to Jeremiah and the true prophets. Possibly the meanings of the names Jaazaniah (equivalent to \"God hearkens\") the son of Azur (equivalent to \"The Helper\"), Pelatiah (equivalent to \"God rescues\") the son of Benaiah (equivalent to \"God builds\"), are chosen as with a grim irony. The name of Azur meets us in Jeremiah 28:1 as that of the father of the false prophet Hananiah. The death of Pelatiah was probably an historical event to which the prophet pointed as a warning to those who, either at Jerusalem or among the exiles, were speaking as he spoke.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It is not near, etc. The words take their place among the popular, half-proverbial sayings of which we have other examples in Ezekiel 8:12; Ezekiel 9:9; and Ezekiel 18:2. As in most proverbs of this kind, the thought is condensed to the very verge of obscurity, and the words have received very different interpretations.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That suggested by the Authorized Version. \"It (the judgment of which the true prophets spoke) is not near. Let us build houses, not, as Jeremiah bids (Jeremiah 39:5), in the land of exile, but here in Jerusalem, where we shall remain in safety. Are we threatened with the imagery of the 'seething pot' (Jeremiah 1:13)? Let us remember that the caldron protects the meat in it from the fire. The walls of the city will protect us from the army of the Chaldeans.\" The temper which clothed itself in this language was that of the self-confident boastful security of Jeremiah 28:3; and the death of Hananiah, the son of Azur, in that history presents a parallel to that of Pelatiah in this.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Grammatically, however, the rendering of the Revised Version is preferable: The time is not near for building houses; probably, as before, with a reference to Jeremiah's advice. \"We,\" they seem to say, \"are not come to that plaint yet. We will trust, as in (1), in our interpretation of the caldron.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) On the whole, I incline, while adopting the Revised Version rendering, to interpret the words, as Smend takes them, as the defiant utterance of despair: \"It is no time for building houses, here or elsewhere. We are doomed. We are destined (I borrow the nearest analogue of modern proverbial speech) 'to stew in our own juice.' Well, let us meet it as we best may.\" I find what suggests this viewNEWLINENEWLINE(1) in the improbability that the thought of the caldron could ever have been received as a message of safety (comp. Ezekiel 24:3, 6); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) in the despairing tone of most of the sayings that Ezekiel records (Ezekiel 18:2; Ezekiel 37:11). Probably there were, as in other like crises in the history of nations (say, e.g., in those of the Franco-German War) rapid alternations between the two moods of boastful security and defiant despair - the galgenhumor, the courage of the gallows, as Smend calls it; and the same words might be uttered now in this temper, and now in that. In either case, there was the root element of the absence of repentance and submission.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - The prophet still, we must remember, in his vision, is bidden to do his work as a true prophet, and to rebuke the defiant speech which he had heard. As in Ezekiel 2:2, the Spirit of Jehovah comes upon him, and throws him into the prophetic ecstasy. It is noticeable that here, as in Ezekiel 2:3, his message is not to Judah only, but to the whole house of Israel as represented by those to whom he spoke. I know the things. This, as ever, was one of the notes of a true prophet, that he shared, as was needed for his work, in the knowledge of him from whom no secrets are hid (John 2:24, 25; Matthew 9:4; 1 Corinthians 14:25). Thoughts, as well as words, were laid bare before him, as they were to his Lord (Hebrews 4:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They are the flesh, etc. The prophet is led to retort their derisive or defiant words. Not they, but the carcases of their victims, were as the \"flesh\" in the \"caldron.\" For themselves, there was another fate in reserve. Neither to be protected by the caldron nor to meet their doom in it, but to be brought out of it. Death, by famine, sword, or pestilence (Ezekiel 5:12), might be the doom of some, but for others, perhaps specially for those whom the prophet addresses, there would be captivity first, and death from the sword which they feared, afterwards.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The strangers are, of course, the Chaldean invaders, and the prediction finds its fulfilment in the massacre of the princes of Judah at Ritdah (Jeremiah 52:9, 10), which was in Hamath, the northern border of Israel (1 Kings 8:65; 2 Kings 14:25). Then they should see that their defiant speech as to the \"caldron\" and \"the flesh\" would be of no avail. Thus they should know that the prophet had spoken in the name of Jehovah, and that their punishment by the heathen was the righteous retribution for their having walked in the ways of the heathen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Pelatiah the son of Benaiah. We must remember that this a as part of the vision, but it may be assumed, in the nature of the case, that it represented what then or afterwards was a fact in history. Had Pelatiah died suddenly during a council meeting? Compare the death of Hananiah in Jeremiah 28:17. As it was, even in the vision, the death so startled and horrified the prophet, that he burst out again into a prayer like that of ch. 9:8. Was the \"residue,\" the \"remnant\" of Israel, represented by one of the chief counsellors of the city, to be thus cut off?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The answer to that question comes as by a new inspiration from the word of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The men of thy kindred, etc. The full force of the phrase can hardly be understood without remembering that the word for \"kindred\" implies the function and office of a goel, the redeemer and avenger of those among his relations who had suffered wrong (Leviticus 25:25, 48; Numbers 5:8), and the point of the revelation is that Ezekiel is to find those who have this claim on him, his true \"brethren,\" not only or chiefly in his natural relations in the priesthood, but in the companions of his exile (the LXX., following a different reading, gives, \"the men of the Captivity\"), and the whole house of Israel, who were in a like position, who were condemned by those who had been left in Jerusalem. As in Jeremiah's vision (Jeremiah 24:1), they were the \"good figs;\" those in the city, the vile and worthless. They were the remnant, the residue, for whom there was a hope of better things. They were despised as far off from the Lord. They were really nearer to his presence than those who worshipped in the temple from which Jehovah had departed. Ewald and Smend take the words as indicative: \"Ye are far,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Yet will I be unto them as a little sanctuary; better, with the Revised Version, a little while, as marking that the state described was transient and provisional. For a time, Ezekiel and the exiles were to find the presence of Jehovah manifested as in the vision of Chebar (Ezekiel 1:4-28), or felt spiritually, and this would make the spot where they found themselves as fully a holy place as the temple had been. There also they would have a \"house of God.\" But this was not to be their permanent lot. There was to be a restoration to \"the land of Israel\" (ver. 17; Ezekiel 37:21), to the visible sanctuary, to a second temple no longer desecrated by the pollutions that had defiled the first. As with all such prophecies, the words had \"springing and germinant accomplishments.\" In Ezekiel 40-48, we have Ezekiel's ideal vision of their fulfilment. A literal but incomplete fulfilment is formed in the work of restoration achieved by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and the hopes then cherished by Haggai and Zechariah. A more complete but less literal fulfilment appears in the Church of Christ as the true Israel of God (Galatians 6:16), and in the Jerusalem which is above (Galatians 4:26). In the fact that in the seer's vision of that heavenly city there is no temple, but the presence of \"the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb\" Revelation 21:22), we find the crowning development of Ezekiel's thought. Intermediate expansions are foundNEWLINENEWLINE(1) in the gradual substitution of the synagogue for the temple in the religious life of Israel;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) in our Lord's words to the woman of Samaria (John 4:21-24); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) in his promise that where two or three are gathered together in his Name, there he would be in the midst of them (Matthew 18:20). The thought that it is the presence of Jehovah that makes the sanctuary, not the sanctuary that secures the presence, Ezekiel may have learnt from the fate of Shiloh (Psalm 78:60).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will give you the land of Israel. The marginal references in the Authorized Version show how entirely Ezekiel was following in the footsteps of his master Jeremiah, as he had done in those of Isaiah, in their prophecies of restoration. Here also the law of\" springing and germinant accomplishments\" finds its application. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 47:13-48:35) has his ideal of a new geographical Israel, as of a new local temple, a land from which idolatrous shrines and high places have disappeared. St. Paul (Romans 9-11.) clings to the thought of a restoration of the literal Israel, even while he strips it of Ezekiel's geographical limitations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I will give them one heart. The LXX., following a different reading, gives \"another heart\" (as in 1 Samuel 10:9); but the Hebrew, represented by the Authorized and Revised Versions, is, without any doubt, right. As in the symbolic action of the joining of the two sticks in Ezekiel 37:15-22, so here, the hope of the prophet, like that of Isaiah and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 32:37-39), looked forward to the unity of the restored people. Judah should no longer vex Ephraim, nor Ephraim Judah (Isaiah 11:13). The long standing line of cleavage should disappear. Oneness of purpose and of action would characterize the new Israel of God. So, in our Lord's prayer for his Church, there is the prayer that \"they may be one\" - made perfect in one (John 17:21-23). Left to itself, Israel tended, as all human communities have tended, to an ever-subdividing individualism, fruitful in sects and parties and schisms. Even the highest of those aspirations has remained as yet without any adequate fulfilment. The ideal unity of the Christian Church is as far distant as that of the Church of Israel. It remains for us to welcome any approximate fulfilments as pledges and earnests of the future unity of the true Israel of God in the heavenly Jerusalem. In the prophet's thoughts that unity was to be brought about by the Divine gift of a \"new Spirit,\" loyal, obedient, unselfish. We note how distinctly, whether consciously or unconsciously, Ezekiel reproduces the thought, almost the very words, of Jeremiah 31:31-33; Jeremiah 32:37-39; how his words are in their turn reproduced in Revelation 21:3-5. The eternal hope asserts itself again and again in spite of all partial failures and disappointments. I will take the stony heart out of their flesh. The thought is, as we have seen, identical with that of Jeremiah 31:31-33, but the form in this instance is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel, and meets us again in Ezekiel 36:26. The \"stony heart\" is that which is \"hardened\" (Ezekiel 3:7) against all impressions of repentance, to all natural or spiritual aspirations of the good. So Zechariah 7:12 speaks of those who had made their hearts \"harder than an adamant stone.\" So we may remember, by way of illustration, that Burns says of the sin of impurity that \"it hardens a' within,\" that \"it petrifies the feeling.\" Ezekiel had seen enough of that stoniness in others, perhaps had, at times, felt it in himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - That they may walk in my statutes, etc. Out of the new spirit there was to grow the new life - a life of righteousness and obedience, as in worship, so also in the acts of man's daily life and his dealings with his neighbours. So, and not otherwise, could the actual relation of Jehovah correspond to the ideal, as it had been declared of old (Exodus 6:7; Leviticus 26:12; 1 Samuel 12:22; 2 Samuel 7:23). This, for Ezekiel, was the crowning blessedness of all, as it had been that of earlier and contemporary prophets (Hosea 2:23; Jeremiah 24:7). To that thought he returns again and again, as to the anchor of his hope (Ezekiel 14:11; Ezekiel 27:14; Ezekiel 36:28; Ezekiel 37:23, 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - But as for them, etc. We note the peculiar phraseology. The heart of the people walks not simply after their detestable things, but after the heart of those things. There is, as it were, a central unity in the evil to which they unite themselves, just as the heart of man turns to the heart of God when the two are in their ideal relation to each other. For those who did this, whether in Jerusalem or among the exiles, there was the prospect of a righteous retribution. The words close the message which Ezekiel heard in the courts of the temple in his visions, but which he was to deliver (ver. 25) to them of the Captivity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - Another stage of the departure of the Divine glory closes the vision. It had rested over the middle of the city. It now halts over the mountain on the east side of the city, i.e. on the Mount of Olives (2 Samuel 15:30; Zechariah 14:4). Currey mentions, but without a reference, a Jewish tradition that the Shechinah, or glory cloud, remained there for three years, calling the people to repentance. What is here recorded may trove suggested the thought of Zechariah 14:4. We may remember that it was from this spot that Christ \"beheld the city, and wept over it\" (Luke 19:41); that from it He, the true Shechinah, ascended into heaven. Here, perhaps, the dominant thought was that it remained for a time to direct the work of judgment. And so the vision was over, and the prophet was borne back in vision to Chaldea, and made known to the exiles of Tel-Abib the wonderful and terrible things tidal he had seemNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.

The teaching by \"the visions of God\" ceases, and that of direct message or symbolic acts is resumed. In each case the point aimed at was the same. The people who heard the one or saw the other were to be taught how utterly groundless was the hope that Jerusalem could hold out against its enemies. The interval between the two was probably a short one, and the new teaching, we may conjecture, had its starting point in the prophecies of a speedy deliverance which were current both at Jerusalem and among the exiles at Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Which have eyes to see, etc. We note the words in their relation both to like utterances in the past (Isaiah 6:9; Isaiah 42:20), and by Ezekiel's contemporary (Jeremiah 5:21), and in the future by our Lord (Matthew 13:13), by St. John (John 12:40), and lastly by St. Paul (Acts 28:27). The thought and phrase were naturally as ever-recurring as the fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-7. - Prepare thee stuff for removing, etc.; better, equipment for a journey, with the implied thought that it is the journey of one going into exile. \"Bag and baggage,\" all the household goods which an exile could take with him (Exodus 12:11, 34 may supply an illustration), were to be brought out in broad daylight and piled up opposite his door. Then in the twilight (Revised Version, in the dark, and so in vers. 7, 12) he was to go forth, not by the door of his house, but by breaking through the wall (with such walls as those of Ezekiel 13:11 the process would not be difficult), as a man might do who was escaping secretly from a city through the gates of which he dared not pass (ver. 5), and was to start with his travelling chattels upon his shoulder. Lastly (ver. 6), as the strangest feature of all, he was to go forth with his face covered, as one who wished to avoid recognition, as one also who could not see one step of the way before him. This, it is intimated, would startle even the most careless, and in this way he would become, as he had been before in like symbolic acts (Ezekiel 4, 5.), as Isaiah (Isaiah 20:2) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 27:2) had been before him, a sign unto the house of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The commands were obeyed, and the prophet waited fur the next inspiration, the next word of the Lord. It would seem as if he had himself done what he was told to do without knowing what it meant. It was not till night had passed to morning that he was able to answer the question which the exiles asked him, What doest thou! At last the answer came.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem; literally, the prince is this burden in Jerusalem. The word \"burden,\" in the sense of \"prophecy,\" so common in Isaiah and Jeremiah and other prophets, as Hosea (Hosea 8:10) and Nahum (Nahum 1:1), is used by Ezekiel here only. Possibly he on the whole avoided it, as having fallen into discredit through its constant use by the false prophets (Jeremiah 23:83-38), and preferred the formula of \"the word of Jehovah.\" As interpreted by Jeremiah 39:4 and 2 Kings 25:4, the \"prince\" is Zedekiah. Possibly Ezekiel avoided the title \"king,\" as seeing in him one who was a ruler de facto, but not a king de jure. The facts related in Jeremiah 39:4 exactly correspond with the symbolic act. Zedekiah and his men of war escape from the city by night, \"by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls,\" probably enough with faces covered, as David's was in his flight (2 Samuel 15:30), to avoid detection, or as a sign of mourning, and through some freshly made exit from the palace. The further significance of the covered face is found in the fact that Zedekiah was blinded at Riblah by Nebuchadnezzar's orders, and from that time could not see the ground on which he trod. Those who see in every Old Testament prediction nothing but a prophecy ex eventu infer from this that this section of Ezekiel was written after the destruction of Jerusalem. I do not take that view, and place it in close connection with the preceding chapters. We note in ver. 11 the peculiar phrase,\" I am your sign.\" Ezekiel, in what he does in the presence of the exiles, is figuring that which, before long, will come to pass in Jerusalem. They were to go forth into captivity as he had gone. For they shall remove, the Revised. Version gives, they shall go into exile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For that he see not, read, with the Revised Version, because be shall not see.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - My net also will I spread, etc. Compare the same image in Lamentations 1:13. The prediction of ver. 12 is reiterated with emphasis. Zedekiah shall be in Babylon, yet shall not see. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10. 7:2; 8:2) relates that Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah, finding an apparent discrepancy in the words that he should not see Babylon, and those of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 32:4; Jeremiah 34:3), hardened himself in his unbelief. There is no reason, however, for supposing that Josephus had access to any other records than the books of the two prophets, and his narrative looks rather like an imagined history of what might have been.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - And I will scatter. The capture of the king would naturally be followed by the dispersion of his adherents, some of whom would fall by the sword, while a few (Hebrew, men of number, i.e. easily counted) would escape to some neighbouring country, where they might hope to find a refuge. There they would have to tell their tale of shame, and to let the heathen know that Jehovah was thus punishing their abominations (comp. Ezekiel 14:22, 23). The prophecy ends with the familiar formula, They shall knew that I am the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The opening words, The worn of the Lord came to me, imply an interval of passivity and silence. One conscious burst of inspiration came to an end, and was followed, after a time, by another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Eat thy bread with quaking, etc. No special stress is to be laid on the fact that only bread and water are named. The prophet is not dwelling now on the scarcity of food in the besieged city, as he had done in Ezekiel 4:9-17, but on the fear and terror which should haunt the lives of the besieged. Here again we can scarcely doubt that, as in ver. 11, Ezekiel was a sign to those among whom he lived. Outwardly and visibly he was seen after his strange flitting, cowering in a corner, as one hunted down and dreading pursuit, with every look and gesture of extremest terror. This was to be the portion of those who escaped and whose life was \"given them for a prey.\" The strange act was to be explained to \"the people of the land,\" i.e. the exiles among whom Ezekiel lived. The short prediction ends with the usual formula. There is another interval, and then another inspiration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - What is that proverb, etc.? The words indicate how the previous messages had been received. Like the men of Jerusalem, the exiles could not believe that the judgment was so near. They said, in words that had become proverbial:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The days are prolonged. \"Month after month passes\" (it is obvious that they had so passed since Ezekiel began his work), \"and yet the end comes not.\" Such throughout the world's history has been the cry of those of little, or of no, faith (Amos 6:3; Isaiah 5:19; Jeremiah 17:15; Matthew 24:48; 2 Peter 3:4).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Every vision faileth. \"The prophet is a dreamer of dreams. We have heard of many such visions, yet still all things continue as they were.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The prophet meets the current proverb with a counter proverb of his own: \"The days are not far off, but have come near.\" Compare the language of the Baptist (Matthew 3:2), of our Lord (Matthew 4:17), of St. Paul (Romans 13:11). For the true prophet there is always a near fulfilment, though there may be also an ultimate and more complete reality of which that is the pledge and earnest. The \"vision\" shall not fail; every word (so in the Hebrew) shall become a reality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Flattering divination. The word is the same as the \"smooth things\" of Isaiah 30:10, the \"flattering lips\" of Psalm 12:2, 3. LXX., μαντευόμενος τὰ πρὸς χάριν; Vulgate, ambigua. The \"divinations\" (the Hebrew word is found only here and in Ezekiel 13:7, though cognate words are found elsewhere) are so described, not without a touch of scorn in the use of a word which is not applied to the utterance of the true prophets, because they promised a speedy deliverance, even within \"two full years\" (Jeremiah 28:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The thought of ver. 93 is reiterated with emphasis. The rebellious house, whether at Tel-Abib or in Jerusalem (probably the word is used with special reference to the former), should see the word of Jehovah fulfilled in their own days. One notes how the prophet dwells on the word prolonged, as though that had specially stirred his indignation. So again -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain the word of the LORD came to me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - The words imply another interval of silence, meditation, and then a fresh utterance to the same effect as before. In this case (ver. 27) we trace a slight modification in the language of the gainsayers. They recognize Ezekiel both as a seer and a prophet. They do not say that his vision \"faileth.\" They content themselves with throwing the fulfilment into the distant future. Their thought is that of the proverb which has been ascribed to more than one king or statesman, Apres moi le deluge. To these his answer is nearly in the same terms as before. Still harping on the offensive word, he tells them that nothing that he has spoken shall be \"prolonged.\" The destruction of the temple and the holy city, the departure of the Divine Presence from the sanctuary, these were already within measurable distanceNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel12:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Another interval follows, and then a fresh and fuller burst of inspiration, manifestly in close connection with Ezekiel 12:21-28, and to be read in combination with Jeremiah 23, which, as Jeremiah was in communication with the exiles (Jeremiah 29:1), Ezekiel may probably have seen. There were false prophets and prophetesses among the exiles as well as in Jerusalem, and an utterance is now found for his long pent up indignation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - Son of man, prophesy, etc. The sin of the men whom Ezekiel denounced was that they prophesied out of their own hearts (Jeremiah 14:14; Jeremiah 23:16, 26), and followed their own spirit instead of the Spirit of Jehovah. All was human and of the earth. Not a single fact in the future, not a single eternal law governing both the future and the past, was brought to light by it. To one who was conscious that he had a message which he had not devised himself, and which he had not been taught by men (Galatians 1:12); that he had no selfish by-ends in what he said and did; that he was risking peace, reputation, life itself, for the truth revealed to him, - nothing could be more repulsive than this claim to have seen a vision of Jehovah, by men who bad in reality seen nothing. For foolish prophets, read, with the stronger Hebrew, the prophets, the fools, the words deriving their force from a kind of paronomasia of alliteration. The nabiim are also the n'balim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4 - Like the foxes in the deserts, etc. The points of comparison are manifold. The fox is cunning (Luke 13:32, where the term is applied to Herod Antipas). It spoils the vine and its fruits (Song of Solomon 2:15); it burrows among ruins (Nehemiah 4:3; Lamentations 5:18). So the false prophets were crafty, laid waste the vineyard of the Lord of hosts (Isaiah 5:7), made their profit out of the ruin of Israel, and made that ruin worse. The 'Reineke Fuchs,' in satirizing the monks and priests of the sixteenth century under the same comparison, presents a curious, though probably unconscious, analogue. In Matthew 7:15 and Acts 20:29 wolves appear as the types of the false prophet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The verse contains two distinct images. There were breaches in the walls of Jerusalem, literally and spiritually, and the false prophets had not been as \"repairers of the breach\" (Isaiah 58:12; Psalm 106:23). The hedge of the vineyard of Israel had been broken through (Isaiah 5:5), and they had done nothing to restore it (Ezekiel 22:30). The day of battle, the day of the Lord, had come, and they were betraying the people instead of helping.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord saith. The verb is that specially used for the utterance of prophets, and the deceivers used it without the authority of a true mission. For they have made others (or, men) to hope, etc., as in the Authorized Version and Revised Version, read, with the margin of Revised Version, they hope to confirm their word, taking the verb as in Psalm 119:43, 49; Job 6:11, et al.). So the Vulgate, persereraverunt confirmare. Through deceiving others, they came to deceive themselves, and were really expecting a fulfilment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Mine hand shall be, etc. After Ezekiel's manner, the thought of ver. 6 is repeated in an altered form in vers. 7, 8. What had been a statement appears as a question to which there could be but one answer. The prophet, as it were, cross examines his rivals. Could they deny the charge? Was not every word of it true? Then, after the statement of the sin of the false prophets, comes the proclamation of the punishment. The hand of Jehovah would be upon them for evil and not for good. In the assembly of my people. The Hebrew word indicates not a large popular gathering, but a secret council of those who deliberate together to carry out their plans (Psalm 89:7; Psalm 111:1; Jeremiah 6:11). The prophets who had acted together, and been looked up to by the people as forming such a council, should lose that position of authority. The words that follow point to a yet lower degradation. They should be in the strictest sense of the word excommunicated. The city of Jerusalem, perhaps every city of Judah, had its register of citizens. In such a register were inscribed also the names of proselytes of other races (Psalm 87:6), and so men came to think of a like register as kept by the King of kings, containing the names of those who were heirs of the \"life\" of the true Israel (Exodus 32:32; Isaiah 4:3; Daniel 12:1). In neither of those registers, the earthly and the heavenly (but stress is probably laid upon the former), shall the false prophets find a place. Ezra 2:62 gives an example of the use made of such registers on the return from the Captivity. One notes the contrast between the \"my people\" which recognizes Israel as still the heritage of Jehovah, and the \"thy people\" used in Ezekiel 3:11 of the rebellious house of the Captivity. For the false prophets there should be no return to the land of Israel such as that which the prophet anticipated for the faithful and the penitent (Ezekiel 37:21; comp. Isaiah 57:13). Here there is no specific mention of the name being struck out. The prophet contemplates a new register, in which their names will never even have appeared.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Peace, when there was no peace. This, as in Micah 3:5; Jeremiah 6:14; Jeremiah 23:17; Zechariah 10:2, was the root evil of the false prophet's work. He lulled men into a false security, and so narcotized their consciences. One built up a wall. The imagery starts from the picture of a ruined city already implied in vers. 4 and 5, and expands into a parable in which we note a parallelismNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to Isaiah's picture of dishonest and unsafe building (Ezekiel 30:13);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to our Lord's parable at the end of the sermon on the mount (Matthew 7:24, 25: Luke 6:47-49).NEWLINENEWLINEWith an incisive sarcasm, Ezekiel describes what we should call the \"scamp-work\" of their spiritual building. They profess to be \"repairers of the breach\" (Isaiah 58:12) in the walls of the spiritual Zion, and this is how they set about it. One built up a wall. This may point to a false prophet, but the \"one\" (Hebrew, \"he\") is probably indefinite, like the French on, equivalent to \"some one.\" Some scheme is devised, an Egyptian alliance or the like, to which the people look for safety. It is, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, a \"slight wall,\" such as was used for partition walls inside houses. They make it do duty as an outside wall (kir in ver. 12). It has no sure \"footings,\" and materials and workmanship are alike defective. The false prophets would smear it over with untempered mortar (the Hebrew word is found only here and in Ezekiel 22:28, and is probably an example of Ezekiel's acquaintance with the technical vocabulary of his time) - with a stucco or plaster, which is hardly better than whitewash (compare the \"whitened\" or plastered wall or sepulchre of Matthew 23:27; Luke 11:44; Acts 23:3), used to hide its detects and give it a semblance of solidity. They come, that is, with smooth words and promises of peace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In words which would almost seem to have been in our Lord's thoughts in Matthew 7:25, we have the picture of an Eastern storm, torrents of rain passing into hail (LXX., λίθοι πετρόβολοι), accompanied by a tornado of irresistible violence (compare like pictures in Exodus 9:22; Joshua 10:11; Isaiah 30:30; Isaiah 28:2, 17). And when the disaster comes men will turn to those who professed to be master builders and repairers of the breach, with derision, and ask, \"Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed?\" And then men shall see that through all this it is Jehovah's hand that has been working. It is he who \"rends\" the wall; he who \"brings it down to the ground;\" he who \"accomplishes his wrath\" (vers. 13-15). That shall be the end of the false \"visions of peace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Set thy face against the daughters of thy people. Here we note that the formula, \"thy people,\" of Ezekiel 3:11 reappears. The section which follows (vers. 17-23) throws an interesting side light on the position of women in the religious life of Israel. For good as for evil, their influence was stronger there than in most other nations. Miriam had led the way (Exodus 15:21), and had been followed by Deborah (Judges 5:4). Huldah had been almost as prominent in Josiah's reformation as Hilkiah the high priest (2 Kings 22:14-20; 2 Chronicles 34:22). It was but natural that there should be women on the other side also, guiding their own sex; and it is probable that Ezekiel had in his thoughts some special leaders who headed the women of Jerusalem in their opposition to Jeremiah, as afterwards at Pathros (Jeremiah 44:15). So, later on, we have the prophetess Noadiah heading the opposition to Nehemiah (Nehemiah 6:14); and in the New Testament, on the one hand, Anns (Luke 2:36) and the daughters of Philip (Acts 21:9), and on the other, the ill-regulated prophetesses of Corinth (1 Corinthians 11:5) and the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess (Revelation 2:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Woe to the women who sew pillows, etc. Ezekiel's minute description, though it is from a different standpoint, reminds us of that in Isaiah 3:18-26. In both cases there are the difficulties inseparable from the fact that he had seen what he describes, and that we have not; and that he uses words which were familiar enough then, but are now found nowhere else. so that (as in the case of the ἐξουσία of 1 Corinthians 11:10) we have to guess their meaning. The picture which he draws of a false prophetess is obviously taken from the life, and the dress, we can scarcely doubt, was one that belonged to her calling. The word for \"sew\" meets us in Genesis 3:7; Job 16:15; Ecclesiastes 3:7; and the English is an adequate rendering. For the word rendered \"pillows,\" the LXX. gives προσκεφάλαια, the Vulgate pulvilli (equivalent to \"cushions\"). The word here obviously denotes an article of dress, something fastened to the arms. For arm-holes read joints of the two hoods, which may mean either knuckles, wrists, or (as in the Revised Version) elbows. Possibly these may have been, like the phylacteries of Matthew 23:5, cases containing charms or incantations, and used as amulets. Something analogous to, if not identical with, these ornaments, is found in the \"seeress wreaths,\" and \"divining garments\" of Cassandra (AEsch., 'Agamemnon,' 1237-1242), and in the \"garlands\" or \"fillets\" of the Pythian priestess in AEsch., 'Eumeu.,' 39. By some writers (Havernick) the word has been taken, as, perhaps, in the Authorized Version, for \"pillows\" in the larger sense, either literally as used in wanton luxury, like the \"tapestry\" of Proverbs 7:16, or figuratively, like the \"wall\" of the preceding section, for counsels that lulled the conscience into the slumber of a false security. Strangely enough, the Hebrew noun rendered \"arm-holes\" has the pronominal suffix \"my arms,\" or \"my hands.\" Keil accepts this rendering, and explains it as meaning that the prophetesses sought to \"bind the arms,\" i.e. to restrain the power of Jehovah. On the whole, it is safer to follow Ewald and Hitzig, as I have done above. Make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature. The word for \"kerchiefs\" is again unique, but is, perhaps, a variant of the word in Isaiah 3:22, and rendered \"wimples\" in the Authorized Version. There is a fair consensus of interpretations that it means, as \"kerchief\" means, some covering for the head, a veil that hangs down over it, like the Spanish mantilla. Its use is, perhaps, explained by the words that follow, which suggest that the veils were not worn by the prophetesses themselves, but by those who came to consult them. The former had, as it were, a whole wardrobe of such veils adapted to persons of various heights, so that in all cases it shrouded their whole form. We may, perhaps, read between the lines the thought that their utterances, like their veils, were adapted to suit every age and every taste. Analogous usages present themselves in the tallith of later Judaism, and the veil worn by the Roman augurs. Ezekiel paints, we may believe, what he had seen. And in those veils he had seen a net cast over the victims of the false prophetesses, a snare from which they could not escape. Will ye hunt, etc.? The question (that form is preferable to the affirmative of the margin of the Revised Version) is one of burning indignation. Omitting the words, \"that come\" (which have nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to them), the second clause will run, \"Will ye make your own souls live?\" and the question is explained by what follows. The prophetesses were living upon the credulity of the victims over whom they cast their nets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Will ye pollute me, etc.? rather, with the Revised Version, ye have profaned, the interrogative form not being continued in the Hebrew. The prophet dwells with scorn on the miserable pay for which the prophetesses were guilty of so great a sin. Not for rewards of divination, like those of Balsam (Numbers 22:7), but for gifts like those bestowed on the harlot or the beggar (l 1 Samuel 2:36; Hosea 3:2) - for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread - they plied their wretched trade. For examples of the lower gifts in kind offered to prophets, compare those of Saul (1 Samuel 9:8), of Jeroboam's wife (1 Kings 14:3), the false prophets in Micah 3:5. And they did this in direct opposition to the will of Jehovah. They \"slew,\" i.e. drew on to destruction, the souls that were meant for life. They \"saved the souls alive,\" i.e. \"their own, which were worthy of death.\" That was the outcome of their \"lying\" divinations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20 - To make them fly, etc.; rather, with the Revised Version and Ewald, as if they were birds, carrying out the thought that the amulets on the arms of the prophetesses, and the veil cast over the heads of the votaries, were like the snare of the fowler. So the threat that follows, that the amulets should be torn off and the veil rent, is practically equivalent to the promise that the victims should be \"delivered out of the snare of the fowler\" (Psalm 91:3; Psalm 124:7). They should no longer he in the power of those who traded on their credulity. They too shall know that he who speaks is indeed Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Because with lies, etc. What specially stirred Ezekiel's indignation was taut the false prophetesses saddened the hearts of the righteous (of those who looked to him and Jeremiah for guidance) with prophecies of evil and deluded the evil door by false hopes, so that he should not turn from his evil way and live. For by promising him life, read, with the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther and the Revised Version, that he should live, as he would do, if he turned from his wickedness (Ezekiel 3:21; Ezekiel 18:9, 17).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - As the result, probably, of the previous utterances, certain elders of Israel, i.e. of the exiles in Tel-Abib, came to consult Ezekiel, wishing to know what counsels or what predictions he had for them. In Ezekiel 8:1 we have \"the elders of Judah,\" and it is possible that there were two groups in the Population of the town, and that these represented Israel as distinct from Judah - a deputation, as it were, from the earlier exiles. The term appears again in Ezekiel 20:1. More probably, however, the terms are used interchangeably.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - These men, etc. The prophet, taught by the word of the Lord, reads the hearts of those who came to him. The words do not imply, rather they exclude, the open practice of idolatry. The sin of the inquirers was that they had set up idols (gillulim, Ezekiel's favourite word; see note on Ezekiel 6:4) in their hearts. The LXX. gives διανοήματα,\"thoughts of their hearts,\" as if to express this. They were hankering after the old false worships in which they had once, taken part. The stumbling block (see Ezekiel 3:20) of their iniquity was set up there. That divided heart, the \"double mind\" of James 1:8, made true inquiry, as it made true prayer for guidance, impossible. Shall I be inquired of at all, etc.? The \"at all\" represents the emphatic iteration of the verb in the Hebrew. The Vulgate, Numquid interrogatus respondebo eis? gives a fair paraphrase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will answer him that cometh, etc. The two last words represent the K'ri, or marginal reading of the Hebrew; the \"therein\" of the Revised Version, the Kh'-tib, or written text. Probably we should read, as in ver. 7, \"I will answer him by myself\" (Hitzig).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That I may take the house of Israel, etc. The words me a threat rather than a promise. The \"double-hearted\" shall be taken in the snare which they have made for themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Turn yourselves, etc.; literally, turn them. But there is no sufficient ground for the margin, \"Turn others,\" the objective suffix being the \"faces\" of the following clause. In Ezekiel 18:30, 32 the verb is used by itself. The prophet's call is to a direct personal repentance, not to the work of preaching that repentance to others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to inquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The stranger that sojourneth among you. It is noticeable that Ezekiel uses here and elsewhere (Ezekiel 47:22, 23) the familiar phrase of the books which most influenced his teaching (Leviticus 16-25; Numbers 9, 15; Deuteronomy passim). It is probable that some such proselytes were found among the exiles of Tel Abib. I the Lord will answer him by myself, etc. This, as has been seen, was probably the right reading in ver. 4. What it means is that, instead of a spoken answer by the mouth of the prophet, there should be an answer in the discipline of life, in the immediate utterance through the conscience, which was the voice of God. The inquirer who came with unconfessed and unrepented hankerings after the worship of other gods deserved and would receive no other answer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - To make him, add, with Revised Version, an astonishment; or better, I will make him amazed, as in Ezekiel 32:10. The words are an echo of Deuteronomy 28:37. The man's punishment shall be open and notorious, so as to strike terror into others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I the Lord have deceived that prophet, etc. The teaching of modern thought is to soften language like this into \"I have permitted him to be deceived.\" The distinction was seldom, if ever, present to the mind of the Old Testament, or indeed of the New Testament, writers. It is Jehovah who sends the \"lying spirit\" in 1 Kings 22:20 -23. It is he who in the latter days shall send men \"strong delusions\" that they shall believe a lie (2 Thessalonians 2:11). In both cases it is implied that the delusion is a righteous punishment, is indeed the natural, because the divinely appointed, punishment of the sin. Populus vult decipi et decipiatur, but the very deception is a means for undeceiving them. At last their eyes shall be opened. The punishment of the false prophet and of those who trust him is at once retributive, and a discipline, and, if the discipline fails for them, at least a warning for others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The words come as a gleam of light through the darkness. A restored nation, walking in the truth, the true people of God, - this lies beyond the mystery of the evil which is allowed, or even made, to work itself out to the bitter end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again to me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - A new section begins, implying as before an interval of silence. What follows presents a striking parallelism to Jeremiah 15:l, 2. There also we have the \"four sore judgments,\" the declaration that not even the presence of Moses and Samuel would avail to save the people. They were obviously selected by Jeremiah as examples of the power of intercession (Exodus 32:11, 12; 1 Samuel 7:9; 1 Samuel 12:23). Ezekiel's selection of names proceeds on a different footing. He chooses exceptional instances of saintliness that had been powerless to save the generation in which they lived; perhaps, also, such as were well known, not only in the records of Israel, but among other nations. Noah had not saved the evil race before the Flood; Job had not saved his sons (Job 1:18); Daniel, though high in the king's favour, had not been able to influence Nebuchadnezzar to spare the people of Judah and Jerusalem. The mention of this last name is significant, as showing the reputation which even then Daniel had acquired. There is no shadow of evidence for the view of some commentators that an older Daniel is referred to. Had there been such a person, eminent enough to be grouped with Noah and Job, there would surely have been some mention of him in the Old Testament. In ver. 13, for the land, read \"a land.\" For staff of bread, see Ezekiel 4:16. The phrase comes from Leviticus 26:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Noisome beasts (see note on Ezekiel 5:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Pestilence is joined with blood, as in Ezekiel 5:17; Ezekiel 38:22, as indicating its death-bearing character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The words end with a gleam of hope shining through the judgments. For Ezekiel, as for Isaiah, there is the thought of a \"remnant that shall return\" (Isaiah 10:20-22). It has been questioned whether \"the ways and the doings\" which are to bring comfort to men's minds are those of the evil past or of the subsequent repentance. I incline to the view that they include both. Men should see at once the severity and the goodness of Jehovah. His punishments had not been arbitrary nor excessive. They had also been as a discipline leading men to repentance. In each of those facts there was a ground of comfort for men who asked the question, which Abraham asked of old, \"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" (Genesis 18:25). In either aspect men will recognize that God has not done without cause all that he has done. In this way the prophet seeks, as others have done since, to justify the ways of God to man. Ezekiel's word for \"remnant\" is, it may be noted, not the same as Isaiah's, its primary significance being \"these that escape.\" Ezekiel does not quote the earlier prophet, though his thoughts are in harmony with him.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - What is the vine tree, etc.? The prophet's mind had apparently been dwelling, after the close of his previous utterance, on the imagery of earlier writers, in which Israel had appeared as the vine of Jehovah (Genesis 49:22; Psalm 80:9; Hosea 10:1; Isaiah 5; Deuteronomy 32:32; Jeremiah 2:21), and to which he himself refers again in Ezekiel 19:10. He saw how men might pervert that image to their own destruction. And he expands the parable, as our Lord does in John 15. Men might dwell, perhaps were actually dwelling, on the thought that they were branches of the true vine, and therefore could not perish. He exposes the groundlessness of that hope in tones of scornful sarcasm. If the vine did not bear fruit, or if it only brought forth wild grapes, then its special excellence was gone, and it challenged comparison with other trees only as a timber tree, and what was its worth as such? If Israel was not true to its vocation, it was poorer and weaker than the heathen nations round it. So far the general thought is clear. In dealing with details, we note that the words in italics, \"or than,\" should disappear, and that the words should stand as in the Revised Version, What is the vine more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Shall wood be taken thereof, etc.? As a timber tree, then, the vine was confessedly valueless. No carpenter would use it, even for the peg upon which men hang their cups, and which had become, as in Isaiah 22:23, the symbol of political stability (comp. also Zechariah 10:4). For the unfruitful vine branch these remained the doom of being cast into the fire (John 15:6). What was its worth when it was half burned at either end and in the middle? What would Israel be fit for when it had been laid low by the \"fire\" of God's judgment? Probably the vivid picture of the charred branch points to the successive judgments which had fallen first on the ten tribes, then on Judah, and lastly on Jerusalem itself. The word \"trespass\" may refer either to the general guilt of the people, or to the last crowning crime of Zedekiah's rebellion. I rather incline to the latter, the noun being in the singular.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned.

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are ignored by him, and he starts from a time of misery and shame. It is obvious that the only period which corresponds to this is that of the sojourn of Israel as an oppressed and degraded people in the land of Goshen. He paints, with a Dantesque minuteness, the picture of a child just born, abandoned by its mother and neglected by all others from the very moment of its birth. It lies unwashed and foul to look upon. No woman's care does for it the commonest offices of motherhood. For to supple, read, with the Revised Version, to cleanse. The practice still met with in the East of rubbing the newborn child with salt may have rested partly on sanitary grounds (Jerome, in loc. Galen, 'De San.,' 1:7), partly on its symbolic meaning (Numbers 18:19). When this was done, the child was wrapt in swaddling clothes (Luke 2:7), but these too were wanting in the picture which Ezekiel draws. The whole scene may have been painted from the life. Such a birth may well have been witnessed during the march of the exiles, when the brutality of their Chaldean drivers allowed no halt, and the child was left to perish of neglect, and the thought may then have flashed across Ezekiel's mind that the pity which he felt for the deserted infant was a faint shadow of that which Jehovah had felt for Israel in the degradation of their heathen bondage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For to the loathing of thy person, read, with the Revised Version, for that thy person was abhorred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For polluted, read, with the Revised Version, weltering, the primary meaning of the verb being that of stamping or treading, and omit \"when thou wast,\" as weakening the condensed force of the original. The marvel of that unlooked for pity is emphasized by the iteration of the word of mercy, Live. The commentary of the Chaldee Targum is sufficiently curious to be quoted: \"And the memory of my covenant with your fathers came into my mind, and I was revealed that I might redeem you, because it was manifest to me that ye were afflicted in your bondage, and I said unto you, 'I will have compassion on you in the blood of circumcision,' and I said unto you, 'I will redeem you by the blood of the Passover'\" (Rosenmuller). The thought underlying this strange interpretation is that blood might be the means of life as well as of pollution, and in that thought there is a significance at once poetical and profound, almost, as it were, anticipating the later thoughts that the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin (1 John 1:7; Revelation 1:5), that we make our robes white in the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 7:14). There is no reason, however, for believing that such thoughts were present to the prophet's mind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The tenses should be in the simple historic past: I caused; thou didst increase and wax great; thou attainedst, and so on (Revised Version). In the word \"multiply\" (Exodus 1:7) the figure passes into historical reality. To excellent ornaments; Hebrew, to ornament of ornaments. The word is commonly used of jewels, trinkets, and the like (Exodus 33:4; 2 Samuel 1:24; Isaiah 49:18). So Vulgate, mundus muliebris. Here, however, the external adorning comes in vers. 10, 11, and instead of the plural we have the dual. Hitzig is, perhaps, right in taking the phrase to refer to tide beauty of the cheeks, which are themselves the ornaments of the golden prime of wroth. The LXX., following either a different reading or paraphrasing, gives, \"to cities of cities.\" The two clauses that fellow point to the most obvious signs of female puberty. For whereas, read, with the Revised Version, yet, etc., as describing, not as the Authorized Version seems to do, a state which trod passed away, but one which still continued even when full-grown girlhood would have demanded clothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The words point to the time of the love of the espousals of Jeremiah 2:2, interpreting the parable, when Israel had grown to the maturity of a nation's life, and gave promise, in spite of previous degradation, of capacities that would render it worthy of the love of the Divine Bridegroom. I spread my skirt over thee. Garments were often used as coverlets, and the act described was therefore, as in Ruth 3:9, the received symbol of a completed marriage (comp. Deuteronomy 22:30; Deuteronomy 27:20). The historical fact represented by the symbol here was probably the formal covenant between Jehovah and Israel (Exodus 24:6, 7). It was then that he became her God, and that she became his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The \"washing\" and \"anointing\" were part of the customary preparations for the marriage union (Ruth 3:3; Esther 2:12; Judith 10:3). The mention of blood receives its explanation, not in the facts of ver. 6, but in the ceremonial rules of Leviticus 15:19-24NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Broidered work; the \"raiment of needlework\" of Psalm 45:14; Judges 5:30; Exodus 35:35; Exodus 38:23. The word meets us again in Ezekiel 27:24, as among the imports of Tyre from Egypt. Curiously enough, the Hebrew verb (rakam) has passed through Arabic into tide languages of Western Europe, and we have the Italian ricamare, the Spanish recamare, the French recamer, for\" embroidering.\" Badgers' skin. Elsewhere in the Old Testament the word is found only in the Pentateuch (Exodus 28:5; Exodus 26:14; Numbers 4:6, 8, 10, et al.). It has been commonly taken as meaning the skin of some animal - badger, dolphin, or porpoise, or, as in the Revised Version, seal, which was used for sandals. All the older versions, however, take it as a word of colour, the LXX. giving ὑακίνθον (\"dark red\"); Aquila, Symmachus, and Vulgate, ianthino (\"violet\"). Possibly the two meanings may coalesce, one giving the material, the other the tint which met the eye. Fine linen. The byssus of Egyptian manufacture (Exodus 25:4; Exodus 26:1; Exodus 39:3, et al.). Silk. The Hebrew word (here and in ver. 13) does not occur elsewhere. The word so translated in Proverbs 31:22 is that which we find here and elsewhere for \"fine linen.\" Silk, in the strict sense of the term, had its birthplace in China, and there is no evidence that even the commerce of Tyre extended so far; but the context points to some fine texture of the lawn or muslin kind, like the Coan vestments of the Greeks. So the LXX. gives τριχαπτόν, as though it were made of fine hair; the Vulgate, subtilia. It is significant that three out of the four articles specified are prominent (as the references show) in the description of the tabernacle and the priestly dress, in Exodus 28, 39. The dress of the bride symbolized the ritual and cultus of Judaism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ornaments. Same word as in ver. 7, but here taken in its more usual sense. (For bracelets, see Ezekiel 23:42; Genesis 24:22, 30; Numbers 31:50. For chain, Genesis 41:42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A jewel on thy forehead; better, with the Revised Version, a ring upon thy nose. The word has the same meaning in Genesis 24:47 (\"earring\" in the Authorized Version); Isaiah 3:21 (where the Authorized Version gives \"nose jewels\"); Proverbs 11:22. Jerome, however, notes (in loc.) that the Syrian women of his time wore pendants or lockets that hung from the forehead to the nostrils. The crown, or diadem (LXX., στέφανος καυχήσεως), the thin circlet of gold confining the hair, completed the catalogue of ornaments. The Chaldee Targum continues its spiritual interpretation: \"I gave the ark of my covenant to be among you, and the cloud of my glory overshadowed you, and the angel of my presence led you in the way.\" And, if we assume, as we legitimately may assume, that Ezekiel, above all others, the prophet of symbolism, did not fill up his picture with details which were only meant to fill it up, this seems a not unfitting interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil. From the dress of the bride we pass to her luxuries in the way of food. The things named might, of course, be only chosen as the delicacies for which the land of Israel was famous (Deuteronomy 32:13, 14), which in the prophet's own time were in demand in the markets of Tyre (Ezekiel 27:17). Cakes of flour and honey were in common use in various forms of Greek ritual, and are probably referred to in Jeremiah 44:19, but in that of the Jews (Leviticus 2:11) honey takes its place, side by side with leaven, as a thing forbidden. Thou didst grow into a kingdom. History crops out through the parable, and points to the stage which it has now reached, i.e. that of the magnificence of the kingdom under Solomon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - It was perfect, etc. (compare the phrase, \"perfection of beauty,\" in Psalm 1:2; Lamentations 2:15, as applied to Jerusalem). The prophet, in the words, my comeliness - majesty (Revised Version) - lays stress on the fact that that \"perfection\" was itself the gift of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - We enter on the history of the apostasy, and the root evil was that the bride of Jehovah had been unfaithful to her Lord. She looked on her glory as her own, and did not recognize that everything in it was the gift of God (Hosea 2:8). The words obviously point to the policy which Solomon had initiated, of alliances with the heathen and the consequent adoption of their worship. This, as from the earliest days of Israel, was the \"whoredom\" (Revised Version) of the unfaithful with (Exodus 34:15, 16; Leviticus 17:7; Deuteronomy 31:16; Judges 2:17; Isaiah 1:21; Jeremiah 2:20; Hosea 1, 2). And it was, so to speak, a promiscuous whoredom. Every passer by was admitted to her embraces, every nation that offered its alliance had its worship recognized and adopted. In the closing words of extremest scorn, the prophet adds, his it was. Jerusalem was, as I have said, the Messalina of the nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - (For high places, see note on Ezekiel 6:6.) The words imply that the shrines upon them were decked with hangings of many coloured tapestry, presenting an appearance like that of a Persian carpet, as in 2 Kings 23:7, of the image of the Asherah. Those hangings were, as in Proverbs 7:16, the ornaments of the adulterous bed. The \"high places\" are named first, as the earliest form of idolatry. The like things shall not come. The words are obscure, and the text probably corrupt. As they stand, they seem to say that the world would never again witness so shameful an apostasy. The Vulgate, Sicut non est factum neque futurum est; extends the comparison to the past. Possibly, though it is a strain upon the grammar, the words may be rendered, \"such things should not come, should not be.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Images of men, etc.; Hebrew, as falling in with the symbolism of the history, \"male images.\" The words point to the teraphim, the penates, or household gods, of which we read in Genesis 31:19; Judges 18:14; 1 Samuel 19:13; Hosea 3:4; and which, like the statues of Baal-peor, may have exhibited the phallic type of idolatry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - Mine oil and mine incense. This, as afterwards in Ezekiel 23:41, was the crowning aggravation of the guilt. The very gifts of God, designed for his worship, were prostituted to that of his rivals. The \"oil\" is that of Exodus 30:23-25, perfumed and set apart for sacred uses. The act of covering the idol was, as in ver. 8, the symbol of the marriage union. In the sweet savour we have the familiar phrase of Ezekiel 6:13. The scene brought before us is that of a sacrificial feast, in which cakes of flour, honey, and oil were eaten whilst incense was offered. So we have the \"adored liba\" of Virgil, 'AEneid,' 7:109, or more fully in Tibullus, 'Eleg.,' 1:7, 53, 54, the \"thuria honores,\" the \"liba ... dulcia melle.\" Thus it was, etc. As in ver. 16, the description seems to rouse an instinctive abhorrence in the prophet's mind, which finds utterance in this form: \"Yes, it was even so.\" The words are, however, taken by the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther as opening the following verse: \"And it came to pass that.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The next stage of idolatry is that of Moloch worship, which never wholly ceased as long as the monarchy of Judah lasted (2 Kings 16:3; Psalm 106:37; Isaiah 57:5; Jeremiah 7:32; Jeremiah 19:5; Micah 6:7; Leviticus 18:21; Leviticus 20:2). It will be noticed that the words, \"the fire,\" are in italics, i.e. are not in the Hebrew, the verb \"to pass through\" having acquired so technical a meaning that it was enough without that addition. This, as the closing words indicate, was the crowning point. As though idolatry in itself was a small matter, it was intensified by infanticide.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Thou hast not remembered. The words gain a fuller significance when we recollect those of Ezekiel's master (Jeremiah 2:2). The husband remembered \"the love of her espousals;\" the faithless wife forgot from what a life of shame and misery she had then been rescued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Woe unto thee, etc.! The interjectional parenthesis, half anathema and half lamentation, looks forward rather than backward. Up to this point Ezekiel had dwelt on the forms of idolatry which were indigenous to Canaan and the nations in immediate contact with it. Now he enters on the later forms of evil which had been adopted from more distant nations. We pass from the time of Solomon to that of Ahaz and Manasseh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - An eminent place; lofty (Revised Version); but the word strictly points to the form of a vault, with the added meaning, as in the LXX., οἵκημα πορνικόν, and the Vulgate, lupanar, of its being used for prostitution. It is, at hast, a curious fact that the Latin fornicari and its derivatives, take their start from the fornices, the vaults or cells which were the haunts of the harlots of Rome. Looking to the fact that all the worst forms of sensual evil came to Rome from the East, and specially from Syria -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Jampridem in Tiberim Syrus defluxit Orontes\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Juv., 'Sat.', 3:62) - it seems probable that the practice was a survival of the custom to which Ezekiel refers. As in the Mylitta worship at Babylon (Herod., 1:262; Bar., 6:43), and that of Aphrodite at Corinth, prostitution assumed a quasi-religious character, and tNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - With the Egyptians. The words point to political and commercial alliances, in themselves a whoredom (Isaiah 23:17; Nahum 3:4), such as Zedekiah, like some of his predecessors, had trusted in, as well as to the adoption of Egyptian worship, such as we have seen in Ezekiel 8:10, the one leading naturally to the other. The words, great of flesh, may point, as we interpret the parable, to the supposed strength of the stout and stalwart soldiers, the chariots and horses of the Egyptians, but possibly also may be a euphemism for the mere animal vigour which stimulated passion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Have diminished thine ordinary food. The husband was bound to provide his wife with food and raiment (Exodus 21:10). Here his first discipline for the unfaithful wife is to place her on a short allowance. Jehovah, to interpret the parable, had placed Israel under the discipline of famine and other visitations that involved a loss of wealth and power. Hosea 2:9, 10 supplies a striking parallel. The daughters of the Philistines. So in ver. 57. The phrase, like \"the daughter of Zion,\" indicates the Philistine cities. These had been, from the days of Samuel to those of Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:18), among the most persistent enemies of Judah (comp. Amos 1:6; Amos 3:9; Joel 3:4; Isaiah 9:12; Isaiah 14:29). In the words, were ashamed of thy lewd way, the prophet points, as his master had done (Jeremiah 2:10), to the fact that other nations had at least been faithful to their inherited religion, while Judah had forsaken hers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - With the Assyrians. Here also the words include political alliances like that of Ahaz with Tiglath-Pileser (2 Kings 16:7), as well as the adoption of idolatrous worship. The latter probably followed under Ahaz as a consequence of the former, and afterwards spread through the influence of the Assyrian colonists - each nation with its own deities - in Samaria (2 Kings 17:24). The culture of the queen of heaven (Jeremiah 44:17), i.e. of the Assyrian Ishtar, may have had this origin. Yet couldest not be satisfied. One is reminded once more of Juvenal ('Sat.,' 6:130).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - In the land of Canaan, etc. The words at first seem to give the nearest and furthest points of the intercourse of Israel with foreign nations. I incline, however, with Smend and the margin of the Revised Version, to take Canaan in its secondary sense as \"the land of traffick,\" Chaldea being in apposition with it (comp. Isaiah 23:8; Hosea 12:7; Zephaniah 1:11, for a like use of the Hebrew word). Chaldea thus comes in its right place as closing the list of the nations with whom the harlot city had been unfaithful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - How weak, etc.! The weakness is that expressed in the Latin impotens libidinis, with no strength to resist the impulses of desire. The word imperious (perhaps masterful would be better) is that of one who is subject to no outward control. One is reminded of Dante on Semimlnis ('Inf.,' 5:56). The strange renderings of the LXX. (τὶ διαθῶ τὴυ θυγατέρα σου) and the Vulgate (in quo mundabo cor tuum) are difficult to account for, but probably indicate that the present text is corrupt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - In that, etc. It is better to take the words as beginning a fresh sentence: \"when thou didst build,\" etc. The historical survey of the harlot's progress is brought to a close, and the prophet points with bitter scorn to what aggravated its degradation. Other nations, like Tyre and Zidon, had risen to prosperity and eminence through their intercourse with foreigners. To Judah it had brought only subjection and the payment of tribute. She had given gifts to all her lovers, instead of receiving from them the rewards of her shame. She was as the adulterous wife who forsakes her husband, and gives what belonged to him to strangers. The conduct of Ahaz in stripping the Temple of its gold and silver to pay tribute to Assyria (2 Kings 16:8), gives an apt illustration of what the prophet means (comp. Hosea 12:1; Isaiah 30:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - From the task of painting the guilt of Judah the prophet proceeds to that of denouncing its punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Thy filthiness; literally, thy brass; probably as alluding to the tribute referred to in the previous verses, \"brass\" being taken as used scornfully for money generally. Possibly, however, as in Jeremiah 6:28, the word stands for the symbol of shame and vileness (compare our brazen faced), and so justifies the rendering of the Authorized Version and Revised Version. Thy nakedness discovered; i.e. interpreting the parable, the intercourse of Judah with foreign nations had simply exposed the points that were moot open to attack (Genesis 42:9). By the blood of thy children. The words may refer specially to the Moloch sacrifices of ver. 21, but may also include the lavish waste of life as well as treasure which had been the consequence of the foreign alliances. The harlot city is indicated as being also a murderess.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - I will gather all thy lovers, etc. Interpreting the parable, the\" lovers\" are the nations with which Judah had allied herself, and whose religion she had adopted. In that confederacy of Moabites, Ammonites, Syrians, Philistines, Edomites and Chaldeans them should be small difference between those whom she had loved and those whom she had hated. All alike would exult in her shame and her fall (comp. Psalm 137:7; 2 Kings 24:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - The bloodshed may refer, as in ver. 36, to the Moloch sacrifices, or may include also other crimea, assassinations and judicial murders (Jeremiah 2:34). Strictly speaking, the punishment of the adulteress was death by stoning (Leviticus 20:2, 10; Deuteronomy 21:21; Deuteronomy 22:21; John 8:5). Did Ezekiel think of the stones cast against the city from the catapult engines of the Chahleans as a literal counterpart of that punishment? In the last clause read, with the Revised Version, I will bring upon thee the blood of fury and jealousy; sc. the death which was inflicted by the indignation of Jehovah as the Husband against whom Judah had sinned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - (For eminent place and high place, see notes on ver. 24.) These the Chaldean conqueror treated as local sanctuaries, and laid them waste. The clothes and the jewels are, of course, all outward tokens of stateliness and prosperity. The (or a) holy city, the perfection of beauty, should be as \"some forlorn and desperate castaway\" (comp. Lamentations 1:1-10 for a companion picture).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - The punishment of stoning was, as a rule, inflicted by the \"congregation\" (Numbers 15:36), or by the men of the city (Leviticus 20:2). Other forms of punishement for impurity were those of the sword and burning, as in Leviticus 20:14; Leviticus 21:9. The thrusting through (better, hewing; the word is not found elsewhere) probably points to mutilation after death, as in the case of Agog (1 Samuel 15:33: comp. Judges 19:29; Daniel 2:5; Daniel 3:29). in this case the \"congregation\" or \"company\" is the army of the Chaldeans, and each form of punishment has its counterpart in the various agencies which they employed for the punishment of the city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - They shall burn thine houris with fire, etc. (comp. 2 Kings 25:9 and Jeremiah 52:13, for the fulfilment of the prediction). The women stand for the \"cities\" which looked on, with awe or exultation, at the destruction of the guilty. Possibly, however, the words may include a literal sense, as in Lamentations 2:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - So will I make my fury, etc.; read, with the Revised Version, will satisfy. The words are not primarily words of comfort. They speak of the satisfaction of the jealous husband's righteous anger, and therefore of a completed punishment. And vet that thought was, as the sequel shows (vers. 53, 60-63), the beginning of hope for the future, as the prophet thought of his people. For here the forms of punishment were not final The daughter of Zion survived the stoning, the sword, and the burning. And so, when wrath had done its work of retribution, it might become corrective and purgatorial. The injured husband, in the bold anthropomorphic language of the parable, would be no more angry. The Lord God of Israel would remember his covenant, and forgive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Because thou hast not remembered (comp. Jeremiah 2:2). There is, so to speak, a certain dawn of tenderness in the new form of reproach, as compared with the sternness of what had gone before, and this in itself implies the pity which is the ground of hope. Fretted. Ezra (Ezra 5:12) uses the same word, there rendered \"provoke.\" Had Ezekiel's use of it stamped it as the right word for confession? Thou shalt not commit, etc. The Vulgate follows a reading which gives, \"I have not done according to thy lewdness,\" etc.; i.e. the guilt had deserved a greater punishment. The Revised Version margin gives, \"Hast then not committed,\" etc.? The word for \"lewdness\" (\"lewd way\" in ver. 27) is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it eleven times. Elsewhere it is translated \"wickedness\" (Leviticus 18:17, et al.), \"lewdness\" in Judges 20:6; Jeremiah 13:27. It conveys always the sense of a guilt that revolts and shocks us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Every one that speaketh proverbs, etc. As in Ezekiel 18:2, we have an example of the tendency of the Eastern mind to condense the experience of life into the form of proverbial sayings. Here the proverb expresses what we call the doctrine of heredite. We say, in such cases, \"Like father, like son;\" but the feeling of the East recognized, especially in the case of daughters, that the mother's influence was predominant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Ezekiel returns to the thought of the spiritual parentage of Jerusalem and Judah, as in ver. 3. Reading between the lines, we find something like an anticipation of St. Paul's thought that Jehovah was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews (Romans 3:29). The Hittites and Sodom and Samaria, to whom she is compared, had all alike been guilty of unfaithfulness to their husbands. Their idolatry was therefore, like hers, an act of apostasy. Jehovah was their husband also, their children were his children (ver. 21). He claimed them as his own, had entered with them also into a relation which, though less close than that with Israel, was as that of the husband to the wife. The thought expands, as we shall see, in the sequel of the chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - No very adequate reason appears for the assignment of the respective ages of the two sisters. Historically, Sodom, as the oldest representative of evil, would have seemed to claim precedence. Samaria may have had this position assigned to it as more closely connected with Judah. The left and right hands indicate respectively a position to the north and south of Jerusalem, the observer of the heavens looking east, as, we may note, the temple did (Ezekiel 8:16). The comparison with Samaria is developed more fully in ch. 23. The daughters are, as elsewhere, the cities dependent on Sodom and Samaria respectively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - The words in italics indicate, as usual, a difficulty. A better construction gives, Thou hast not... done after a small measure only. So the Vulgate, Neque secundum scelera earum fecisti pauxillum minus. The LXX. connects the words with the clause that follows: \"Thou wast all but (παρὰ μικρὸν) corrupted more than they.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 49, 50. - It is noticeable that what we commonly speak of as the specific sin of the cities of the plain is not mentioned here. The prophet fixes on the point which made Sodom a luxurious and sensual city, the graver evil being just hinted at in the word abominations, and as the outcome of the evil tendencies. So in like manner the special sin of Samaria, the worship of the calves, is not named, but taken for granted. (For fulness of bread, see Proverbs 30:9: Hosea 13:6; Deuteronomy 8:12.) Prosperity and luxury in her case, as in that of other wealthy cities, hardened the hearts of men against the poor and needy. There was probably a sufficient reason for the omission which has been pointed out. It was wiser to dwell on the sins which were common to the two cities rather than on the vice which, though it existed in Jerusalem (2 Kings 23:7), was probably not prevalent there. As I saw good; better, according to what I saw. The word \"good\" is not in the Hebrew, and the words apparently refer to Genesis 18:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 51, 52. - Thou hast justified, etc. The word has a touch of sarcasm. Sodom and Samaria might claim a verdict of acquittal (\"justify,\" in its technical sense) as compared with Judah. They had not presented, as she had done, a confluence of all the worst idolatries. The words find something like an echo in our Lord's teaching Matthew 10:15; Matthew 11:24. And, as is common m such cases,\" she had judged,\" i.e. had passed sentence of condemnation on those who were more righteous than herself. The Revised Version changes both meaning and punctuation: Bear thine own shame, in that thou hast given judgment for thy sisters; through thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they, they are more righteous than thou; but the Authorized Version seems preferable. It may be questioned whether the word for judged is ever used of an acquittal. The point of the sentence is that Judah condemned those who were less guilty than herself (comp. Romans 2:17-23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - When I shall bring again; better, with the Revised Version, both here and in ver. 55, and I will turn again. The Authorized Version reads like a sentence of hopeless and perpetual condemnation, as per impossible. When Sodom and Samaria should be pardoned, then, and not till then, should there be hope for Judah. But all that follows in the chapter shows that what is meant is a promise of restoration, not for Judah only, but also for her less guilty sisters. Ezekiel sees a far off hope for his own nation, and he cannot limit the mercy of God in bringing them also, as she was to be brought, to repentance. For them also punishment was a means to an end beyond itself, corrective, and not merely retributive. The language of Isaiah (Isaiah 19:23-2.5) as to Egypt and Assyria presents a striking parallel, and may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - Even in that restoration, however, there should be a further clement of humiliation. Judah should be a comfort (see Ezekiel 14:22) to those who should see her placed lower than themselves, content, at last, to lake the lowest place, humbling herself that she might be (ver. 61) afterwards exalted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - Read and for when, as in ver. 53.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - Thy sister Sodom, etc. The golds are obscure. The most tenable interpretation may be expressed by a paraphrase. The name of Sodom was not in the lips of Judah in the days of her prosperity. It was too vile for utterance, except as a byword of reproach. Isaiah (Isaiah 1:9, 10) had in vain reminded her that she had made herself like them. Her fate could never be like theirs. Now, in the day of the discovery (the uncovering, or laying bare) of her wickedness (ver. 57), she had learnt the lesson.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - For thy reproach, read, with the Revised Version, the reproach. The words point primarily to the disasters, not of Judah, but to those that fell on the cities of Syria and Philistia - the Assyrian and Chaldean invasions. (For the grouping of the two nations as enemies of Judab, see Isaiah 9:12; and for special acts of hostility, 2 Kings 15:37; 2 Kings 16:6; and 2 Chronicles 28:18, 19.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - Thou hast borne, etc. Judah, i.e., had received the full measure of its punishments. The righteousness of God had been adequately vindicated. And so, if the punishment led to repentances, there was room for pardon (compare for the thought, Isaiah 40:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 59, 60. - I will even deal with thee, etc. The law of retribution is stated in all its fulness. Falling back upon the idea of the espousals of Israel in the covenant made at Sinai (Leviticus 26:42, 45; Deuteronomy 29:11, 12), Ezekiel presses home on Judah the thought that she had broken that covenant. She must suffer as though it no longer existed. She must \"dree her weird\" and \"accept her punishment\" (Leviticus 26:41). And then Jehovah would show that he had not really been unmindful of his part in it. He bad remained faithful in spite of her unfaithfulness. And so in the day of her repentance he will not only renew it, but will give it a higher and more permanent character. The \"new covenant\" of which Ezekiel's master had spoken (Jeremiah 31:31) should not be as the old, decaying and vanishing away, but should be foreverlasting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 61. - Then thou shalt remember thy ways, etc. The pardon which God gives is not, as men sometimes dream, a water of Lethe, blotting out the memory of the evil past. Ezekiel represents that memory as quickened to a new intensity in the very hour of restoration. The shame which it brings with it is necessary as the safeguard of the new blessedness. Thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger. It is significant that, as in the Revised Version, both the adjectives are now in the plural. What was possible for Sodom and Samaria was possible also, as for the cities more immediately connected with them, so also for other nations of the heathen world. They to should be admitted into fellowship, not now as alters, but as daughters, acknowledging, i.e., her superiority. The limitation which follows, not by thy covenant, asserts, as it were, the restored prerogative of Judah, much as St. Paul asserts it in Romans 9-11. Those who are within the covenant of Israel, including, as it does, those who are the heirs of the faith of Abraham as well as his children according to the flesh, are in a closer relation to him than others who share in what have been called (the phrase, perhaps, taking its origin from these very words) the \"uncovenanted mercies\" of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel16:63VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 63. - That thou mayest remember. The words paint vividly the attitude of the penitent adulteress, humble, contrite, silent, ashamed (Hosea 3:3-5), and yet with a sense that she is pardoned, and that the husband against whom she has sinned is at last pacified. Revised Version, when I have forgiven thee. The Hebrew verb so rendered is that which expresses the fullest idea of forgiveness, and which marked both the \"day\" and the \"sacrifice\" of atonement (Numbers 8:12; Leviticus 23:27, et al.). This, according to the received etymology, was represented in the mercy seat, the ἱλαστήριον, of the ark of the covenant (cophereth, as from caphar). So the prophet closes with the wet, Is of an eternal hope what had at first seemed to heal up to nothing but eternal condemnation. How far the prophet expected a literal fulfilment in the restoration of Sodom and Samaria, we cannot define with certainty; but the ideal picture of the purification of the waters of the Dead Sea in ch. 47:8 suggests that it entered into his vision of the future. For us, at least, it is enough to pass from the temporal to the eternal, from the historical to the spiritual, and to see in his words the noblest utterance of mercy prevailing over judgment - a theodikea, a \"vindication of the ways of God to man,\" like that of Romans 11:33-36.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Put forth a riddle, etc. Again there is an interval of silence, till another theme is suggested to the prophet's mind and worked out elaborately. This he describes as a \"riddle\" (same word as the \"dark speeches\" of Numbers 12:8, the \"hard questions\" of 1 Kings 10:1). It will task the ingenuity of his hearers or readers to interpret it, and so he subjoins (vers. 12-24) the interpretation. That interpretation enables us to fix the occasion and the date of the prophecy. It was the time when Zedekiah was seeking to strengthen himself against Nebuchadnezzar by an Egyptian alliance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The eagle with great wings and long pinions (Revised Version) probably the golden eagle, the largest species of the genus - stands for Nebuchadnezzar, as it does in Jeremiah 48:40; Jeremiah 49:22. In Isaiah 46:11 the \"ravenous bird\" represents Cyrus. Possibly the eagle head of the Assyrian god Nisroch (2 Kings 19:37; Isaiah 37:38) may have impressed the symbolism on Ezekiel's mind. A doubtful etymology gives \"the great eagle\" as the meaning of Nisroch. The divers colours indicate the variety of the nations under the king's sway (Daniel 3:4: 4:1). If the cedar was chosen to t,e the symbol of the monarchy of Judah, then it followed that Lebanon, as the special home of the cedar, should take its place in the parable. Possibly the fact that one of the stateliest palaces of Solomon was known as the \"house of the forest of Lebanon\" (1 Kings 7:2; 1 Kings 10:17, 21) may have made the symbolism specially suggestive. The word for highest branch is peculiar to Ezekiel (here and in ver. 22). The branch so carried off was carried into \"a land of traffick\" (Hebrew, LXX., and Vulgate, \"a land of Canaan,\" the word being generalized in its meaning, as in Ezekiel 16:29), i.e. to Babylon, as pre-eminently the merchant city of the time. This, of course, refers to Nebuchadnezzar's deportation of Jeconiah and the more eminent citizens of Jerusalem (2 Kings 24:8-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The seed of the land is Zedekiah, who was made king by Nebuchadnezzar in Jeconiah's place. The imagery of the willow (the Hebrew word occurs here only) seems suggested by Ezekiel's surroundings. No tree could stand out in greater contrast to the cedar of Lebanon than the willows which he saw growing by the waters of Babylon (Psalm 137:2, though the word is different). The choice of the willow determined the rest of the imagery, and the fruitful field and the great or \"many\" (Revised Version) waters represent Judah, possibly with reference to its being in its measure a \"land of brooks of waters,\" of \"fountains and depths,\" of \"wheat and barley and wine\" (Deuteronomy 8:7-9; Deuteronomy 11:10-12). The kingdom of Zedekiah, i.e., was left with sufficient elements for material prosperity. That prosperity is indicated in ver. 6 by the fact that the willow became a vine. It was of \"low stature,\" indeed, trailing on the ground. It could not claim the greatness of an independent kingdom. Its branches turned toward the planter (ver. 6); its roots were under him. It acknowledged, that is, Nebuchadnezzar's suzerainty, and so, had things continued as they were, it might have prospered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The other great eagle is, of course, Egypt, then under Apries, or Pharaoh-Hophra (Jeremiah 44:30). We note the absence of the \"long pinions\" and the \"many colours\" of the first eagle. Egypt was not so strong, nor did her sway extend over so great a variety of nations as Babylon. To that eagle the vine bent its roots, i.e., as in ver. 15, Zedekiah courted the alliance of Pharaoh (Apries), and trusted in his chariots, he was to water the vine, which so turned to him from the beds of her plantation (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Ezekiel repeats, as justifying Nebuchadnezzar's action, that his first intention had been to leave Zedekiah under conditions which would have given his kingdom a fair measure of prosperity. The vine might have borne fruit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The prophet, like his contemporary Jeremiah (Jeremiah 37:7), like his predecessor Isaiah (Isaiah 30:1-7), is against this policy of an Egyptian alliance. The question which he asks, as the prophet of Jehovah, implies an answer in the negative. The doom of failure was written on all such projects. The he of the next question is not Nebuchadnezzar, but indefinite, like the French on. For leaves of her spring, read, with the Revised Version, fresh springing leaves; or, the leaves of her sprouting. The Authorized Version and the Revised Version of the last clause seems to assert that Nebuchadnezzar would have an easy victory. It would not take great power or much people to pluck up such a vine from its roots. I adopt, with Keil and Hitzig, the rendering, not with great power or much people will men be able to raise it up from its roots; i.e. no forces of Egypt or other allies should be able to restore Judah from its ruins. Its fall was, for the time, irretrievable (comp. ver. 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The question, Shall it prosper? comes with all the emphasis of iteration. The east wind is, as elsewhere, the symbol of scorching and devastating power (Ezekiel 19:12; Hosea 13:15; Jonah 4:8; Job 27:21). For furrows, read beds, with Revised Version. In the case of the Chaldeans, who came from the east, there was a special appropriateness in the symbolism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - The parable has been spoken. Ezekiel, after the pause implied in ver. 11, now becomes its interpreter. And that interpretation is to be addressed to the \"rebellious house\" (Ezekiel 2:3, 6) among whom he lived. Probably even among the exiles of Tel-Abib there were some who cherished hopes of the success of the Egyptian alliance, and of the downfall of the power of Babylon as its outcome. The tenses are better in the indefinite past - \"came,\" \"took,\" \"brought,\" and so on in ver. 13. The history of Jeconiah's deportation and of Zedekiah's oath of fealty (2 Chronicles 36:13) is recapitulated. He dwells specially on the fact that the mighty of the land had been carried off with Jecoutah. It was Nebuchadnezzar's policy to deprive the kingdom of all its elements of strength - to leave it \"bare.\" Even masons. smiths, and carpenters were carried off, lest they should be used for warlike preparations (2 Kings 24:16). It could not lift itself up. It was enough if \"by keeping its covenant\" it was allowed to stand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - That they might give him horses. The \"chariots and horses\" of Egypt seem, throughout its whole history, to have been its chief element of strength. See for the time of Moses (Exodus 14:7), of Solomon (1 Kings 10:28, 29), of Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 12:3), of Hezekiah (Isaiah 31:1: 36:9). Shall he prosper? What had been asked in the parable is asked also, in identical terms, in the interpretation. Ezekiel presses home the charge of perfidy as well as rebellion. Like Jeremiah, he looks on Nebuchadnezzar as reigning by a Divine right.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Ezekiel repeats the prediction of Ezekiel 12:13. The prison in Babylon, under the eye of the king against whom he had rebelled; this was to be the outcome-of the alliance with Egypt. The prophecy was probably written when the hopes of Zedekiah and his counsellors were at their highest point, when the Chaldeans had, in fact. raised the siege in anticipation of the arrival of the Egyptian army (Jeremiah 37:5-11). Ezekiel, like Jeremiah (loc. cit.), declared that the relief would be but temporary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - By casting up mounts, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, when they cast up mounts. The words describe the strategical operations, not of the Egyptians against the Chaldeans, but of the Chaldeans, when they recovered from their first alarm, against Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:1; Jeremiah 39:1). The Egyptians, Ezekiel predicts, would be powerless to prevent that second and decisive siege. In vers. 18, 19 the prophet emphasizes the fact that this would be the just punishment of Zedekiah's perfidy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The words receive a special significance as being identical with those which Ezekiel had uttered in Ezekiel 12:13, with the addition that the sin against Nebuchadnezzar as the vicegerent of Jehovah, was a sin against Jehovah himself as the God of faithfulness and truth. There, in Babylon, the real character of his sin should be brought home to the conscience of the blind and captive king. What follows in ver. 21, in like manner, reproduces Ezekiel 12:14, 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - From the message of deserved chastisement the prophet passes to the promise of restoration. The cedar of Israel is not dead. Jehovah would, in his own time, take the highest branch, tender and slender though it might be, the true heir of David's house, and deal with it far otherwise than the Chaldean conqueror had done. The latter had carried off the branch to the \"land of traffick\" - sc. had brought Jeconiah to Babylon. Jehovah would plant his branch upon the \"mountain of the height of Israel\" (Isaiah 2:2; Micah 4:1). It was not to be as a willow in a low place, but to flourish, true to its origin as a cedar, so that \"all fowl of every wing\" should dwell in the shadow of its branches (comp. Ezekiel 31:3-9, where the same imagery is used of Assyria; and Matthew 13:32). As with like prophecies in Isaiah 11:1 and Isaiah 53:2 (where the \"tender one\" finds a parallel), the words paint an ideal never historically realized, but finding a partia1 fulfilment in Zerubbabel and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple, merging in the still unfulfilled vision of the kingdom of the Messiah and the restoration of Israel. To Ezekiel, as to other prophets, it was not given to know the times and the seasons, or even the manner of the fulfilment of his hopes; and when he uttered the words, the vision may have seemed not tar off, but nigh at hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel17:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - All the trees of the field, etc. As the cedar of Lebanon stands here for the royal house of David, so the other \"trees\" represent the surrounding nations, who are thought of as witnessing, first the strange prostration, and then the yet stranger resurrection of the house and the might of Judah and Israel. The thought, which reproduces that of 1 Samuel 2:7, finds an echo in Luke 1:51, 52. Another echo of the words may, perhaps, be traced in the \"green tree\" and the \"dry\" of Luke 23:31. Here then, also, as in ch. 16, the utterance which begins with judgment, ends in mercy. Behind the picture of the blind, discrowned king the prophet sees that of the Divine ideal King in the fulness of his majesty and power.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - What mean ye, that ye use this proverb, etc.? Another and entirely different section opens, and we see at once from what it started. Ezekiel had heard from the lips of his countrymen, and had seen its working in their hearts, the proverb (already familiar to him, it may be, through Jeremiah 31:29) with which they blunted their sense of personal responsibility. They had to bear the punishment of sins which they had not committed. The sins of the fathers were visited, as in Exodus 20:5; Exodus 34:7; Leviticus 26:39, 40; Numbers 14:18; Deuteronomy 5:9, upon the third and fourth generations. Manasseh and his people had sinned, and Josiah and his descendants and their contemporaries had to suffer for it. The thought was familiar enough, and the general law of the passages above referred to was afterwards applied, as with authority, to what was then passing (2 Kings 23:26; 2 Kings 24:3). Even Jeremiah recognized it in Lamentations 5:7 and Jeremiah 15:4, and was content to look, for a reversal of the proverb, to the distant Messianic time of the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:29-31). The plea with which Ezekiel had to deal was therefore one which seemed to rest on the basis of a Divine authority. And that authority was confirmed by the induction of a wide experience. Every preacher of righteousness in every age has to warn the evil doer that he is working evil for generations yet unborn, to whom he transmits his own tendencies, the evil of his own influence and example. It is well that he can balance that thought with the belief that good also may work in the future with a yet wider range and mightier power (Exodus 20:5). Authority and experience alike might seem to favour the plea that the fathers had eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on edge. Ezekiel was led, however, to feel that there was a latent falsehood in the plea. In the depth of his consciousness there was the witness that every man was personally responsible for the things that he did, that the eternal righteousness of God would not ultimately punish the innocent for the guilty, he had to work out, according to the light given him, his vindication of the ways of God to man, to sketch at least the outlines of a theodicy. Did he, in doing this, come forward as a prophet, correcting and setting aside the teaching of the Law? At first, and on a surface view, he might seem to do so. But it was with him as it was afterwards with St. Paul He \"established the Law\" in the very teaching which seemed to contradict it. He does not deny (it would have been idle to do so) that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children, i.e. affect those children for evil. What he does is to define the limits of that law. And he may have found his starting point in that very book which, for him and his generation, was the great embodiment of the Law as a whole. If men were forbidden, as in Deuteronomy 24:16, to put the children to death for the sins of the fathers; if that was to be the rule of human justice, - the justice of God could not be less equitable than the rule which he prescribed for his creatures. It is not without interest to note the parallelism between Ezekiel and the Greek poet who was likest to him, as in his genius, so also in the courage with which he faced the problems of the universe. AEschylus also recognizes ('Agam.,' 727-756) that there is a righteous order in the seeming anomalies of history. Men might say, in their proverbs, that prosperity as such provoked the wrath of the gods, and brought on the downfall of a \"woe insatiable;\" and then he adds -NEWLINENEWLINE\"But I, apart from all,NEWLINEHold this my creed alone.\" And that creed is that punishment comes only when the children reproduce the impious recklessness of their fathers. \"Justice shines brightly in the dwellings of those who love the right, and rule their life by law.\" Into the deeper problem raised by the modern thought of inherited tendencies developed by the environment, which itself originates in the past, it was not given to Ezekiel or AEschylus to enter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Stress is laid on the fact that the proverb which implied unrighteousness in God is no longer to be used in Israel. There, among the, people in whom he was manifesting his righteousness for the education of mankind, it should be seen to have no force whatever. The thought was an essentially heathen thought - a half-truth distorted into a falsehood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Behold, all souls are mine, etc. The words imply, not only creation, ownership, absolute authority, on the part of God, but, as even Calvin could recognize (in loc.), \"a paternal affection towards the whole human race which he created and formed.\" Ezekiel anticipates here, and yet more fully in ver. 32. the teaching of St. Paul, that \"God willeth that all men should be saved\" (1 Timothy 2:4). The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The sentence, though taken from the Law, which ordered capital punishment for the offences named, cannot be limited to that punishment. \"Death\" and \"life\" are both used in their highest and widest meaning - \"life\" as including all that makes it worth living, \"death\" for the loss of that only true life which is found in knowing God (John 17:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-9. - The verses that follow are noticeable as forming one of the most complete pictures of a righteous life presented in the Old Testament. It ads characteristic of Ezekiel that he starts from the avoidance of sins against the first table of the commandments. To eat upon the mountains was to take part in the sacrificial feasts on the places, of which he had already spoken (Ezekiel 16:16; comp. 22:9; Deuteronomy 12:2). The words, lifted up his eyes, as in Deuteronomy 4:19 and Psalm 121:1, implied every form of idolatrous adoration. The two sins that follow seem to us, as compared with each other, to stand on a very different footing. To Ezekiel, however, they both appeared as mala prohibita, to each of which the Law assigned the punishment of death (Leviticus 18:19; Leviticus 20:10, 18; Deuteronomy 22:22), each involving the dominance of animal passions, in the one case, over the sacred rights of others; in the other, over a law of self-restraint which rested partly on physical grounds, the act condemned frustrating the final cause of the union of the sexes; partly, also, on its ethical significance. The prominence given to it implies that the sin was common, and that it brought with it an infinite degradation of the holiest ties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Hath restored to the debtor his pledge. The law, found in Exodus 22.25 and Deuteronomy 24:6, 13, was a striking instance of the considerateness of the Mosaic Law. The garment which the debtor had pledged as a security was to be restored to him at night. Such a law implied, of course, the return of the pledge in the morning. It was probably often used by the debtor for his own fraudulent advantage, and it was a natural consequence that the creditor should be tempted to evade compliance with it. The excellence of the man whom Ezekiel describes was that he resisted the temptation. Hath spoiled none by violence. Comp. Leviticus 6:1-5, which Ezekiel probably had specially in view. The sin, common enough at all times (1 Samuel 12:3), would seem to have been specially characteristic of the time in which Ezekiel lived, from the king downwards (Jeremiah 22:13). As contrasted with the sin, there was the virtue of generous almsgiving (Isaiah 58:5-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He that hath not given forth his money upon usury. The word \"usury,\" we must remember, is used, not, as with us, for exorbitant interest above the market rate, but for interest of any kind. This was allowed in commercial dealings with foreigners (Deuteronomy 23:20), but was altogether forbidden in the case of loans to Israelites (Exodus 22:25; Leviticus 25:35, 37; Deuteronomy 23:19: Isaiah 24:2). The principle implied in this distinction was that, although it was, on strict principles of justice, allowable to charge for the use of money, as for the use of lands or the hire of cattle, Israel, as a people, was under the higher law of brotherhood. If money was to be lent at all, it was to be lent as to a brother in went (Matthew 5:42; Luke 6:35), for the relief of his necessities, and not to make profit. A brother who would not help a brother by a loan without interest was thought unworthy of the name. The ideal of the social polity of Israel was that it was to consist of a population of small freeholders, bound together by ties of mutual help - a national friendly society, rather than of traders and manufacturers; and hence the whole drift of its legislation tended to repress the money making spirit which afterwards became specially characteristic of its people, and ate like a canker into its life. The distinction between the two words seems to be that \"usury\" represents any interest on money; and \"increase,\" any profit on the sale of goods beyond the cost of production, as measured by the maintenance of the worker and his family. To buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest was not to be the rule in a nation of brothers, and it was wiser to forbid it altogether rather than to sanction what we call a \"reasonable rate\" of interest or profit. Hath executed true judgment. The last special feature in the description of the righteous man is that he is free from the judicial corruption which has always been the ineradicable evil of Eastern social life (1 Samuel 8:3; 1 Samuel 12:3; Amos 5:12; Isaiah 33:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A robber. The Hebrew implies robbery with violence, perhaps, as in the Authorized Version margin, the offence of the housebreaker. That doeth the like to any of these things. The margin of the Revised Version, following the Chaldee paraphrase, gives, who doeth to a brother any of these things. Others (Keil and Furst) render, \"who doeth only one of these things,\" as if recognizing the principle of James 2:10. On the whole, there seems sufficient reason for keeping to the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The word \"duties\" is not in the Hebrew, but is legitimately introduced as expressing Ezekiel's meaning, where the mere pronoun by itself would have been ambiguous. In English we might say, \"He does these things: he does not do those;\" but this does not fall in with the Hebrew idiom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The word abomination probably covers the specific sin named in ver. 6, but not here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - One holes the special emphasis, first of the question, and then of the direct negative, as though that, in the judgment alike of God and man, was the only answer that could be given to it in the very words of the Law (Leviticus 20:9, 11, 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-17. - Now, lo! etc. The law of personal responsibility had been pressed on its darker side. It is now asserted in its brighter, and that with the special emphasis indicated in its opening words. The proverb of the \"sour grapes\" receives a direct contradiction. The son of the evil doer way take warning by his father's example, and repent, as Ezekiel exhorted those among whom he lived to do. In that case he need fear no inherited or transmitted curse. He shall surely live; Hebrew, living he shall live. That truth came to Ezekiel as with the force of a new apocalypse, and it is obviously \"exceeding broad,\" with far-reaching consequences both in ethics and theology.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The reappearance of the father, with the same emphatic \"lo!\" seems to imply that Ezekiel thought of the two phenomena as possibly contemporaneous. Men might see before them, at the same time, the father dying in his sins, and the son turning from them and gaining the true life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Why? doth not the son, etc.? The words are better taken, with the LXX., Vulgate, Revised Version, and most critics, as a single question, Why doth not the son bear, etc.? What is the explanation of a fact which seemingly contradicts the teaching of the Law? The answer to the question seems at first only an iteration of what had been stated before. The son repents, and therefore does not bear his father's iniquity. A man is responsible for his own sins, and for those only. To think otherwise is to think of God as less righteous than man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - But if the wicked will turn, etc. Here, however, there is a distinct advance. The question is carried further into the relations between the past and the present of the same man, between his old and his new self. And in answering that question also Ezekiel becomes the preacher of a gospel. The judgment of God deals with each man according to his present state, not his past. Repentance and conversion and obedience shall cancel, as it were, the very memory of his former sins (Ezekiel's language is necessarily that of a hold anthropopathy), and his transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him (comp. Ezekiel 33:16; Isaiah 43:25; Isaiah 64:9; Jeremiah 31:34). Assuming the later date of Isaiah 40-66, the last three utterances have the interest of being those of nearly contemporary prophets to whom the same truth had been revealed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Have I any pleasure, etc.? Ezekiel's anticipations of the gospel of Christ take a yet wider range, and we come at last to what had been throughout the suppressed premise of the argument. To him, as afterwards to St. Paul (1 Timothy 2:4) and St. Peter (2 Peter 3:9), the mind of God was presented as being at once absolutely righteous and absolutely loving. The death of the wicked, the loss, i.e., of true life, for a time, or even forever, might be the necessary consequence of laws that were righteous in themselves, and were working out the well being of the universe; but that death was not to be thought of as the result of a Divine decree, or contemplated by the Divine mind with any satisfaction. If it were not given to Ezekiel to see, as clearly as Isaiah seems to have seen it, how the Divine philanthropy was to manifest itself, he at least gauged that philanthropy itself, and found it fathomless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - In the previous argument (ver. 21) the truth that the individual character may change had been stated as a ground of hope. Here it appears as a ground, for fear and watchfulness. The \"grey-haired saint may fail at last,\" the apostle may become a castaway (1 Corinthians 9:27), and the righteousness of a life may be cancelled by the sins of a year or of a day. Whether there was an opening for repentance, even after that fall, the prophet does not say, but the law that a man is in spiritual life or death according to what he is at any given moment of his course, seems to require the extension of the hope, unless we assume that the nature of the fall in the case supposed fetters the freedom of the will, and makes repentance impossible (Hebrews 6:4-7; 2 Peter 2:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Are not my ways equal? The. primary meaning of the Hebrew adjective is that of something ordered, symmetrically arranged. Men would find in the ways of God precisely that in which their own ways were wanting, and which they denied to him - the workings of a considerate equity, adjusting all things according to their true weight and measure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-29. - The equity of the Divine judgments is asserted, as before, by fresh iteration rather than by new arguments. In a discourse delivered, as this probably was, orally, it was necessary, so to speak, to hammer in the truth upon men's minds so that it might be driven home and do its work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - That work was to produce repentance, hope, and fear. The goodness and severity of God alike led up to that. For a man to remain in his sin will be fatal, but it is not the will of God that he should so remain. What he needs is the new heart and the new spirit, which are primarily, as in Ezekiel 11:19, God's gift to men, but which men must make their own by seeking and receiving them. So iniquity shall not be your ruin; better, with the margin of the Revised Version, so shall they not be a stumbling block (same word as in Ezekiel 3:20; Ezekiel 7:19; Ezekiel 14:3) of iniquity unto you. Repented sins shall be no more an occasion of offence. Men may rise on them to \"higher things,\" as on \"steppingstones of their dead selves.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel18:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Turn yourselves, etc. As in Ezekiel 14:6, but there is no ground for the rendering of \"turn others,\" suggested in the margin of the Authorized Version. So we close what we may rightly speak of as among the noblest of Ezekiel's utterances, that which makes him take his place side by side with the greatest of the prophets as a preacher of repentance and forgiveness. In the next chapter he returns to his parables of history after the fashion of those of ch. 17.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The two sections of this chapter - vers. 1-9, 10-14-are respectively two parables of the same type as that of Ezekiel 2:10. The former telling nearly the same story under a different imagery, the latter a reproduction of the same imagery, with a slightly different application. Lamentation. The same word as that used in Ezekiel 2:10. The whole chapter finds a parallel in Jeremiah's review of Josiah's successors (Jeremiah 22:10-30). It is noticeable that the princes are described as being of Israel. The LXX. gives the singular, \"the prince,\" and Hitzig and Ewald adopt this reading, applying it to Zedekiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - What is thy mother? etc.; better, with the Vulgate, LXX., and Keil, Why did thy mother, a lioness, lie down among lionesses? The image may have been suggested by Genesis 49:9 and Numbers 23:24, or perhaps also by Nahum 2:11, 12. The lioness is Israel, the kingdom idealized and personified. The lionesses among whom she had lain down are the heathen kingdoms. The question asks why she had become as one of them and adopted their cruelty and ferocity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The whelp, as ver. 4 shows, is Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum (Jeremiah 22:11), who \"did evil\" in the sight of the Lord (2 Kings 23:32), the words that follow pointing to cruelty and oppression like that of Zedekiah. The passage finds a somewhat striking parallel in AEschylus, 'Agam.,' 695-715.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The nations also heard of him, etc. The fact that lies under the parable is that Egypt and its allies began to be alarmed as they watched the aggressive policy of Jehoahaz, as men are alarmed when they hear that a young lion is in the neighbourhood, and proceed to lay snares for him. In chains, etc.; literally, nose rings, such as were put into the nostrils of brutes or men (Ezekiel 38:4; 2 Kings 19:28; Isaiah 37:29). The mention of Egypt points to the deportation of Jehoahaz by Pharaoh-Necho (2 Kings 23:34; Jeremiah 22:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The second lion whelp is identified by ver. 9 with Jehoiachin. For some reason or other, probably because he, as having \"slept with his fathers,\" was not so conspicuous an instance of retribution, Ezekiel passes over Jehoiakim (B.C. 607-599).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He knew their desolate palaces; literally, widows; but the word is used figuratively in Isaiah 13:22, in the sense of \"desolate houses\" (comp. Isaiah 47:8). So the Vulgate gives didicit viduas facere; and Keil adopts that meaning here, \"he knew, i.e. outraged, the widows of Israel.\" The Revised Version admits it in the margin. The two words for \"widows\" and \"palaces\" differ in a single letter only, and there may have been an error in transcription. On the whole, I adhere to the Authorized Version and Revised Version (text). Currey explains, \"He knew (i.e. eyed with satisfaction) his palaces,\" from which he had ejected their former owners, as his father Jeboiakim had done (Jeremiah 22:15, 16). Ewald follows the Targum in a various reading of the verb, and gets the meaning, \"he destroyed its palaces.\" Interpreting the parable, we have Jehoiachin described as alarming Nebuchadnezzar and the neighbouring nations by his activity, and therefore carried off to Babylon as Jehoahaz lad been to Egypt. The young lion was to roar in chains, not on the \"mountains of Israel.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Another parable comes close upon the heels of the first. Thy mother; sc. Judah or Jerusalem, as the mother of Jehoiachin, who is still in Ezekiel's thoughts, and is addressed by him. In thy blood. (For the comparison of the vine, see Ezekiel 17:6.) No satisfactory meaning can be got out of the words, the nearest being \"in thy life, thy freshness,\" the sap of the vine being thought of as its blood; and critics have been driven to conjectural readings or renderings. The Jewish interpreters, Targum, Rashi, Kimchi, and margin of Revised Version, give, \"in thy likeness,\" sc. \"like thee;\" Keil, \"in thy repose,\" sc. in the period of quiet prosperity. Hitzig boldly adopts a reading which gives, \"a vine climbing on the pomegranate;\" but (?).

The use of the conjunction indicates here, as in Jonah 1:1, that the narrative that follows links itself on to something that has gone before. In Exodus 1:1 and 1 Samuel 1:1 it may point to a connection with the book that precedes it. Here the sequence is subjective. We may think of Ezekiel as retracing the years of his life till he comes to the thirtieth. Then, as it were, he pulls himself up. That must be the starting point of what he has to say. Our English use of \"now\" is nearly equivalent to this. In the thirtieth year. I incline, following Origen, Hengstenberg, Smend, and others, to refer the date to the prophet's own life. That year in Jewish reckoning was the age of full maturity. At that age the earlier Levites (Numbers 4:23, 20, 39, 43, 47) had entered on their duties. It is probable, though no written rule is found, that it was the normal age for the functions of the priesthood. In the case of our Lord (Luke 3:23) and of the Baptist it appears to have been recognized as the starting point of a prophet's work. Jeremiah's call as a \"child\" (Jeremiah 1:6; the word may, however, include adult manhood, as in 1 Samuel 30:17; 1 Kings 3:7) was obviously exceptional. Other theories are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That the years are reckoned from the era of Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar ( B.C. 625), dating from his throwing off the sovereignty of Assyria, and giving here the date B.C. 595 (Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Ewald, and others); but against this it may be urgedNEWLINENEWLINE(a) that there is no evidence that that era was in use in Ezekiel's time, andNEWLINENEWLINE(b) that he nowhere else uses a double historical chronology.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That the years are reckoned from the discovery of the book of the Law in the reign of Josiah (2 Kings 22:8; 2 Chronicles 34:14), as a turning point or era in the history of Judah (Targum, Theodoret, Jerome, Havernick), which would again bring us to B.C. 595. This view is, however, open to the same objections as (1). We have no proof that the Jews ever reckoned from that event, and Ezekiel did not want, here or elsewhere, another point to reckon from, as far as his people's history was concerned, than the captivity of Jehoiachin. In the fourth month. Both here and in ver. 2 the months are probably reckoned from Abib, or Nisan, the month of the Passover, with which the Jewish year began (Exodus 12:2; Nehemiah 2:1; Esther 3:7), so that the fourth month, known by later Jews as Tammuz, would bring us to June or July. Among the captives (literally, the captivity) by the river of Chebar. By most earlier commentators the Chebar has been identified with the Chaboras of the Greeks (now the Khabour), which rises in Upper Mesopotamia, at Ras-el-Ain, and falls into the Euphrates at Carcesium, a city which modern geographers distinguish from the Carchemish of the Old Testament. Recent critics, however (Rawlinson, Smend, and others), have urged that this was too far north to be in the \"land of the Chaldeans\" (ver. 3), or Babylon (2 Kings 24:16), and have suggested that the Chebar of Ezekiel is the Nahr-Malcha, or Royal Canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of that king's irrigation works, to which, therefore, the name Chebar (i.e. uniting) would be appropriate. The identification of Chebar with the labor of 2 Kings 17:6, to which the ten tribes had been deported (whether, with Rawlinson, we think of that river as identical with the Chaboras, or still further north, near an affluent of the Tigris of the same name), must, for like reasons, be rejected. The two names are, indeed, spelt differently, with initial letters that do not interchange. The heavens were opened. The phrase, not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, appears in Matthew 3:16; John 1:51; Acts 7:56; Acts 10:11; Revelation 4:1. Visions of God. The words admit of three interpretations:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Great, or wonderful, visions; as in the \"mountains of God\" (Psalm 36:6), the \"cedars of God\" (Psalm 80:10), the \"river of God\" (Psalm 65:9);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) visions sent from God; orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) actual theophanies or manifestations of the Divine glory, of theseNEWLINENEWLINE(3) is most in harmony with what follows, here and elsewhere, on the phrase (comp. Ezekiel 8:3; Ezekiel 40:2; Ezekiel 43:3). Such a theophany constituted in his ease, as in that of Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:9), Zechariah (Zechariah 1:8-14), his call to the office of a prophet. The visions may be thought of as manifested to his waking consciousness in an ecstatic state, and are thus distinguished from the dreams of sleep (comp. Joel 2:28 for the distinction between the two - \"visions\" belonging to the young, and \"dreams\" to the old). The visions of Balaam, seen in a \"trance,\" but with his \"eyes open\" (Numbers 24:3, 4), and of St. Paul, \"whether in the body or out of the body\" he could not tell (2 Corinthians 12:2, 3), present suggestive parallels.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The fifth year of King Jehoiachin's captivity. The date of this deportation stands as B.C. 599 (2 Kings 24:8-16; 2 Chronicles 36:9, 10), and thus brings us to B.C. 595/4 as the time of Ezekiel's first vision. It was for him and for his fellow exiles a natural starting point to reckon from. It would have been, in one sense, as natural to reckon from the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, as Jeremiah does (Jeremiah 39:1, 2), but Ezekiel does not recognize that prince - who was, as it were, a mere satrap under Nebuchadnezzar - as a true king, and throughout his book systematically adheres to this era (Ezekiel 8:1; Ezekiel 20:1; Ezekiel 24:1, et al.). About this time, but a year before, the false prophets of Judah were prophesying the overthrow of Babylon and the return of Jeconiah within two years (Jeremiah 28:3), and the expectations thus raised were probably shared by many of Ezekiel's companions in exile, while he himself adhered to the counsels of the leter which Jeremiah had sent (Jeremiah 29:1-23) to the Jews of the Captivity. To one who felt himself thus apart from his brethren, musing over many things, and perhaps perplexed with the conflict of prophetic voices, there was given, in the \"visions of God\" which he relates, the guidance that he needed. They did not break in, we may well believe, suddenly and without preparation on the normal order of his life. Like other prophets, he felt, even before his call, the burdens of his time. and vexed his soul with the ungodly deeds of these among whom he lived.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The word of the Lord came expressly, etc.; literally, coming, there come the word of the Lord; the iteration having (as commonly in this combination in Hebrew) the force of emphasis. The phrase stands, as elsewhere, for the conscious inspiration which made men feel that Jehovah had indeed spoken unto them, and that they had a message from him to deliver. To give parallel passages would be to copy several pages from a concordance, but it may not be without interest to note its first (Genesis 15:1) and last (Malachi 1:1) occurrences in the Old Testament, and its reappearance in the New Testament (Luke 3:2). Unto Ezekiel. We note the transition from the first person to the third; but it does not give sufficient ground for rejecting either ver. 1 or ver. 2, 3 as an interpolation. (For the prophet's name, which appears only here and in Ezekiel 24:24, see Introduction; and for \"land of Chaldeans,\" note on ver. 1.) The hand of the Lord. Here again we haw a phrase of frequent occurrence, used of Elijah (1 Kings 18:46), of Elisha (2 Kings 3:15), of Daniel (Daniel 8:18; Daniel 10:10), of Isaiah (Isaiah 8:11), of St. John (Revelation 1:17). The \"hand\" of the Lord is the natural symbol of his power, and the phrase seems to be used to add to the consciousness of inspiration, that of a constraining, irresistible power. Ezekiel continually uses it (Ezekiel 3:14, 22; Ezekiel 8:1; Ezekiel 33:22; Ezekiel 37:1; Ezekiel 40:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A whirlwind came out of the north. What, we ask, was the meaning of this symbolism? In Jeremiah 1:13, 14 a like symbol is explained as meaning that the judgments which Judah was to suffer were to come from the north, that is, from Chaldea, upon the prophet's countrymen. Here the prophet is himself in Chaldea, and what he sees is the symbol, not or calamities, but of the Divine glory, and that explanation is, accordingly, inapplicable. Probably the leading thought here is that the Divine presence is no longer in the temple at Jerusalem, It may return for a time to execute judgment (Ezekiel 8:4; Ezekiel 10:1, 19, 20), and may again depart (Ezekiel 11:23), but the abiding glory is elsewhere, and the temple is as Shitoh had been of old (Psalm 78:60). Ezekiel was looking on the visible symbol of what had been declared in unfigurative language by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7:12, 14; Jeremiah 26:6, 9). That the north should have been chosen rather than any other quarter of the heavens is perhaps connectedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) with Job 37:22, where it appears as the region of \"fair weather,\" the unclouded brightness of the \"terrible majesty\" of God;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) with Isaiah 14:13, where \"the sides of the north\" are the symbols of the dwelling place of God. For the Jews this was probably associated with the thought of the mountain heights of Lebanon as rising up to heaven (Currey, on Ezekiel 1:4, in 'Speaker's Commentary'), or with the fact that the \"north side\" of Zion (Psalm 48:2), as the site of the temple, was the \"dwelling place of the great King.\" Parallels present themselves in the Assyrian hymns that speak of the \"feasts of the silver mountains, the heavenly courts\" (as the Greeks spoke of Olympus), \"where the gods dwell eternally\" ('Records of the Past,' 3:133), and this ideal mountain was for them, like the Meru of Indian legend, in the farthest north. So, in the legendary geography of Greece, the Hyperborei, or \"people beyond the north,\" were a holy and blessed race, the chosen servants of Apollo (Herod., 4:32-36: Pindar, 'Pyth.,' 10:4; AEsch., 'Choeph.,' 373). Possibly the brilliant coruscations of an Aurora Borealis may have led men to think of it as they thought of the glory of the dawn or the brightness of the lightning, as a momentary revelation of the higher glory of the throne of God. (For the \"whirlwind\" as the accompaniment of a Divine revelation, see 1 Kings 19:11; Job 38:1; Acts 2:2.) A great cloud, etc. So far the signs of the approaching theophany were like those on Sinai (Exodus 19:16, 18) and Horeb (1 Kings 19:11). With a fire infolding itself; the Revised Version margin gives flashing continually. The Authorized Version suggests the thought of a globe of fire darting its rays through the surrounding darkness. The colour of amber; literally, the eye. The Hebrew word for \"amber\" (chashmal) occurs only here and in ver. 27 and ch. 8:2. It is almost absolutely certain that it does not mean what we know as \"amber.\" The LXX. and Vulgate give electrum, and this, in later Greek and Latin authors, has \"amber\" for one of its meanings. Primarily, however, it was used for a metallic substance of some kind, specifically for a compound four parts of gold and one of silver (Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 23:4, s. 23). Some such compound is probably what we have to think of here, and so the description finds a parallel in Daniel 10:6; Revelation 1:15. This, in its ineffable brightness, is seen in the centre of the globe of fire. One may compare Dante's vision of the Divine glory ('Paradise,' 33:55).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The likeness of four living creatures. The Authorized Version is happier here in its rendering than in Revelation 4:6, where we find \"beasts\" applied to the analogues of the forms of Ezekiel's vision. There the Greek gives ζῶα, as the LXX. does here, while in Daniel 7:3-7 we have θήρια In Ezekiel 10:15 they are identified with the \"cherubim\" of the mercy seat; but the fact that they are not so named here is presumptive evidence that Ezekiel did not at first recognize them as identical with what he had heard of those cherubim, or with the other like forms that were seen, as they were not seen, in the temple (1 Kings 6:29; 1 Kings 7:29), on its walls (2 Chronicles 3:7), and on its veil or curtain (Exodus 36:35). What he sees is, in fact, a highly complicated development of the cherubic symbols, which might well appear strange to him. It is possible (as Dean Stanley and others have suggested) that the Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures, the winged bulls and lions with human heads, which Ezekiel may have seen in his exile, were elements in that development. The likeness of a man. This apparently was the first impression. The \"living creatures\" were not, like the Assyrian forms just referred to, quadrupeds. They stood erect, and had feet and hands as men have.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - We note the points of contrast with other like visions.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) In Isaiah 6:2 each seraph has six wings, as each \"living creature\" has in Revelation 4:8.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) In Revelation 4:7 the four heads are distributed, one to each of the \"living creatures,\" while here each has four faces, and forms, as it were, a Janus quadrifrons. The wings are described more minutely in ver. 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Their feet were straight feet, etc. The noun is probably used as including the lower part of the leg, and what is meant is that the legs were not bent, or kneeling. What we may call the bovine symbolism appears at the extremity, and the actual foot is round like a calf's. The LXX. curiously enough gives \"their feet were winged (πτερωτοὶ).\" Burnished brass. Probably a shade less brilliant, or more ruddy, than the electrum of ver. 4 (see note there).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They had the hands of a man, etc. The prophet seems to describe each detail in the order in which it presented itself to him. What he next sees is that each of the four forms has two hands on each of its four sides. Nothing could supersede that symbol of activity and strength.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Their wings were joined, etc. As interpreted by vers. 11 and 24, two of the wings were always down, and when the living creatures moved, two were extended upwards, so that their tips touched, and were in this sense \"joined.\" When at rest, these were let down again (ver. 24). They turned not, etc. We note the emphasis of the threefold iteration of the fact (vers. 12, 17). None of the four forms revolved on its axis. The motion of what we may call the composite quadrilateral was simply rectilinear. Did the symbolism represent the directness, the straightforwardness, of the Divine energy manifested in the universe?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As for the likeness, etc. The Revised Version rightly strikes out the comma after \"lion.\" The human face meets the prophet's gaze. On the right he sees the lion, on the left the ox, while the face of the eagle is behind. What did the symbols mean?NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The human face represents the thought that man, as made \"after the image of God\" (Genesis 1:27), is the highest symbol of the Eternal. So long as we remember that it is but a symbol, anthropomorphism is legitimate in thought, and appropriate in visions; though, like theriomorphism, it becomes perilous, and is therefore forbidden (Exodus 20:4; Deuteronomy 4:17) when it takes concrete form in metal or in stone. So Daniel (Daniel 7:9, 13) sees the \"Ancient of Days\" and \"one like unto a son of man;\" and St. John's vision (Revelation 1:13) represents the same symbolism.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The lion had been the familiar emblem of sovereignty, both in the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 7:29) and in his palace (1 Kings 10:20; 2 Chronicles 9:18, 19). So, in Genesis 49:9, it is the symbol of the kingly power of Judah, and appears with a yet higher application in Revelation 5:5; while, on the other hand, it represents one of the great monarchies of the world in Daniel 7:4. Its modern heraldic use in the arms of England and elsewhere presents yet another analogue.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The ox had appeared, as here, so also in 1 Kings 7:25, 44, in company with the lion, notably in the twelve oxen that supported the \"sea\" or \"laver\" in the temple. Here also we have a kind of sovereignty - the natural symbol of a strength made subservient to human uses. Both the lion and the ox, as we have seen, may have become familiar to Ezekiel as a priest ministering in the temple or as an exile.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The eagle was, in like manner, though not taking its place in the symbolism of the temple, the emblem of kingly power, and is so employed by Ezekiel himself in Ezekiel 17:3, 7; while in Daniel 7:4 the lion has eagle's wings (comp. Hosea 8:1; Isaiah 46:11; Obadiah 1:4; Habakkuk 1:8). In Assyrian sculpture Nisroch (the name is cognate with the Hebrew for \"eagle,\" nesher) appears as an eagle-headed human figure, and is always represented as contending with or conquering the lion and the bull (Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:458, 459). The facts suggest the inferenceNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that Ezekiel may have seen this symbol;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that over and above the general thought that all the powers of nature are subject to the government of God, there was also the more specific thought that the great kingdoms of the earth were but servants of his, to do his pleasure? The reproduction of the fourfold form, with the variation already noticed, in Revelation 4:7, is every way suggestive, and it is, at least, a natural inference that the symbols had acquired a new significance through the new truths that had been revealed to the seer of Patrons; that the human face may have connected itself with the thought of the Son of man who shared in the glory of the Father; the ox with that of his sacrifice; the lion with that of his sovereignty over Israel, as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (Revelation 5:5); the eagle with that of his bearing his people as on eagles' wings, into the highest heavens (Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11) The patristic interpretation, which finds in the four living creatures the symbols of the four evangelists (an interpretation by no means constant or unvarying - the lion being sometimes identified with St Matthew, and the man with St. Mark, and conversely, while the ox and the eagle are uniformly assigned to St. Luke and St. John respectively), must be considered as the play of a devout imagination, but not as unfolding the meaning of either Ezekiel or St. John. In the later Jewish tradition the four forms are assigned, taking Ezekiel's order, to the tribes of Reuben, Judah, Ephraim, and Dan, as the \"standards\" (Numbers 2:2) which they generally bore when encamped in the wilderness; but this is obviously outside the range of the prophet's thoughts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thus were their faces: and, etc.; better, with Revised Version, and their faces and their wings were separate above; i.e. were stretched upward, touching the neighbouring wings at the tip, and so \"joined,\" while the other two covered the bodies and were never stretched (comp. Isaiah 6:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Whither the spirit was to go, etc. The description passes on to the originating force of the movement of the mysterious forms. The Hebrew noun may mean \"breath,\" \"wind,\" or \"spirit,\" the meanings often overlapping one another. Here the higher meaning is probably the true one. The \"Spirit\" (as in Genesis 1:1; Genesis 6:3; Psalm 104:30; Psalm 139:7; Isaiah 40:7, 13; and in Ezekiel himself, passim) is the Divine Source of life in all its forms, especially in its highest form, moral, intellectual, spiritual. It is this which gave unity and harmony to the movements of the \"living creatures,\" as it gives a life, harmony, and unity to all the manifold manifestations of the might of God of which they were the symbols. (On \"they turned not,\" see note on ver. 9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Like burning coals of fire, etc. It may not be amiss to note the fact that the phrase throughout the Bible denotes incandescent wood. The nearest approach to its use by Ezekiel is in 2 Samuel 22:9, 13. For \"lamps,\" read, with the Revised Version, \"torches.\" Here the vision of Ezekiel, in which the living creatures were thus incandescent, bathed, as it were, in the fire that played around them, yet not consumed, followed in the path of previous symbols - of the burning bush (Exodus 3:2), of the pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13:22), of the fire on Sinai (Exodus 19:18), of the \"fire of the Lord\" (Numbers 11:1-3), and the \"fire of God\" (2 Kings 1:12). Speaking generally, \"fire,\" as distinct from \"light,\" seems to be the symbol of the power of God as manifested against evil. \"Our God is a consuming Fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24; Hebrews 12:29). The red light of fire has in it an element of terror which is absent from the stainless white of the eternal glory, or from the sapphire of the visible firmament. Lightning (comp. Exodus 19:16; Exodus 20:18; Daniel 10:6; Revelation 4:5; Revelation 8:5; Revelation 11:19; Revelation 16:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Ran and returned. Compare the \"to and fro\" of Zechariah 4:10. The comparison implies at once suddenness (as in Matthew 24:27) and overwhelming brightness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Behold one wheel, etc. As the prophet gazed, yet another marvel presented itself - a \"wheel\" was seen. It is \"by\" or \"beside\" (Revised Version) the living creatures, and \"for each of the four faces thereof\" (Revised Version); i.e. as the next verse states definitely, there were four wheels. We may compare the analogues of the \"wheels\" of fire in the theophany of Daniel 7:9, and the chariot of the cherubim in 1 Chronicles 28:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Like unto the colour of a beryl. The Hebrew for \"beryl\" (tarshish) suggests that the stone was called, like the turquoise, from the region which produced it. Here and in Daniel 10:6 the LXX. leaves it untranslated. In Exodus 28:20 we find χρυσόλιθος; in Ezekiel 10:9 and Ezekiel 28:13 ἄνθραξ, i.e. carbuncle. It is obvious, from this variety of renderings, that the stone was not easily identified. Probably it was of a red or golden color, suggesting the thought of fire rather than the pale green of the aquamarine or beryl (see especially Daniel 10:6). They four had one likeness, etc. A closer gaze led the prophet to see that there was a plurality in the unity. For the one \"wheel\" we have four; perhaps, as some have thought, two wheels intersecting at right angles, perhaps, one, probably seen behind, perhaps also below, each of the living creatures. They are not said actually to rest upon it, and the word \"chariot\" is not used as it is in 1 Chronicles 28:18. They would seem rather to have hovered over the wheels, moving simultaneously and in full accord with them. The \"wheels\" obviously represent the forces and laws that sustain the manifold forms of life represented by the \"living creatures\" and the \"Spirit.\" In each case the number four is, as elsewhere, the symbol of completeness. A wheel in the midst of (within, Revised Version) a wheel; i.e. with an inner and outer circumference, the space between the two forming the \"ring\" or felloe of ver. 18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - When they went, etc. The meaning seems to be that the relative position of the wheels and the living creatures was not altered by motion. On \"they turned not,\" see note on ver. 9. All suggests the idea of orderly and harmonious working.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - As for their rings, etc. The \"rings\" or \"felloes\" of the wheels impressed the prophet's mind with a sense of awe, partly from their size, partly from their being \"full of eyes.\" These were obviously, as again in Ezekiel 10:12, and in the analogues of the \"stone with seven eyes\" in Zechariah 3:9; Zechariah 4:10, and the \"four beasts [i.e. 'living creatures'] full of eyes,\" in Revelation 4:6, symbols of the omniscience of God working through the forces of nature and of history. These were not, as men have sometimes thought, blind forces, but were guided as by a supreme insight (comp. 2 Chronicles 16:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The wheels went by them; better, with Revised Version, beside them; i.e. moving in parallel lines with them. And when the living creatures went, etc. The truth embodied in the coincident movements of the \"living creatures\" and the \"wheels,\" is the harmony of the forces and laws of nature with its outward manifestations of might. In the two directions of the movement, onward and upward - when the living creatures were lifted up - we may seeNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the operations of the two when they are within the range of man's knowledge, and, as it were, on the same plane with it; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) those which are as in a higher region beyond his ken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Whithersoever the spirit was to go, etc. The secret of the coincidence of the movements of the \"living creatures\" and of the \"wheels\" was found in the fact, which the prophet's intuition grasped, that the phenomena of life and law had one and the same originating source. For \"the spirit of the living creature\" (singular, because the four are regarded as one complex whole), the LXX., Vulgate, and Revised Version margin, give \"the spirit of life,\" a rendering tenable in itself, but the contextual meaning of the word is in favour of the Authorized Version and the Revised Version text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - When those went, these went. The words, strictly speaking, add nothing to the previous description; but the prophet appears to have wished to combine what he had before said separately, so as to make the picture complete, before passing on to the yet more glorious vision that next met his gaze.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And the likeness of the firmament, etc. The word is the same as that in Genesis 1, passim; Psalm 19:1; cf. 1; Daniel 12:3. It meets us again in vers. 23, 25, 26, and in 10:1, but does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. What met the prophet's eye was the expanse, the \"body of heaven in its clearness\" (Exodus 24:10), the deep intense blue of an Eastern sky. Like the colour of the terrible crystal, etc. The Hebrew noun is not found elsewhere. Its primary meaning, like that of the Greek κρύσταλλος, is that of \"cold,\" and I incline therefore to the margin of the Revised Version, \"ice.\" Rock crystal, seen, as it is, in small masses, and in its pure colourless transparency, hardly suggests the idea of terror; but the intense brightness of masses of ice, as shining in the morning sun, might well make that impression. Had Ezekiel seen the glories of a mountain throne of ice as he looked up, on his nay from Palestine to Chaldea, at the heights of Lebanon, or Hermon, and thought of them as the fitting symbol of the throne of God? We note, in this connection, the use of \"terrible\" in Job 37:22 (see note on ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Under the firmament, etc. The description must be read as completing that of ver. 11. The two upper wings of the \"living creatures\" were not only stretched out, but they pointed to the azure canopy above them, not as sustaining it, but in the attitude of adoration. Nature, in all her life phenomena, adores the majesty of the Eternal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The noise of their wings, etc. The wings representing the soaring, ascending elements in nature, their motion answers to its aspirations, their sounds to its inarticulate groanings (Romans 8:26) or its chorus of praise. The noise of great waters may be that of the sea, or river, or torrents. Ezekiel's use of the term in Ezekiel 31:7, in connection with the cedars of Lebanon, seems in favour of the last. On the other hand, in Ezekiel 27:26; Psalm 29:3; Psalm 107:23, the term is manifestly used for the seas. The thought appears again in Revelation 1:15; Revelation 19:6. In Psalm 29:3, et al., the \"voice of the Lord\" is identified with thunder. For the voice of speech, which wrongly suggests articulate utterance, read, with the Revised Version, a noise of tumult.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And there was a voice from the firmament. Revised Version gives above. The prophet's silence suggests that what he heard was at first ineffable (comp. 2 Corinthians 12:4), perhaps unintelligible. All that he knew was that an awful voice, like thunder (comp. John 12:29), came from above the expanse of azure, and that it stilled the motion of the wings, working peace, as in the midst of the endless agitations of the universe. The wings that had been stretched upward are now folded, like the others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The likeness of a throne. The greatest glory was kept to the last. High above the azure expanse was the likeness of a throne (we note the constant recurrence of the word \"likeness,\" nine times in this one chapter, as indicating Ezekiel's consciousness of the vision character of what he saw). The idea of the throne of the great King first appears in 1 Kings 22:19, is frequent in the Psalms (Psalm 9:4, 7; Psalm 11:4; Psalm 45:6), notably in Isaiah 6:1. In the visions of St John (Revelation 1:4, and passim) it is the dominant, central object throughout. As the appearance of a sapphire stone. The intense blue of the sapphire has made it in all ages the natural symbol of a heavenly purity. Ezekiel's vision reproduces that of Exodus 24:10. It appears among the gems of the high priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:18; Exodus 39:11) and in the \"foundations\" of Revelation 21:19. The description of the sapphire given by Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:9), as \"never transparent, and refulgent with spots of gold,\" suggests lapis lazuli. As used in the Old Testament, however, the word probably means the sapphire of modern jewellery (Braun, 'De Vest. Sacerd.,' p. 630, edit. 1680). A likeness as of the appearance of a man. The throne, the symbol of the sovereignty of God over the \"living creatures\" and the \"wheels,\" over the forces and the laws which they represented, is not empty. There was \"a likeness as of the appearance\" (we note again the accumulation of words intended to guard against the thought that what was seen was more than an approximate symbolism) \"of a man.\" In that likeness there was the witness that we can only think of God by reasoning upward from all that is highest in our conceptions of human greatness and goodness, and thinking of them as free from their present limitations. Man's highest thought of God is that it is \"a face like his face that receives him.\" He finds a humanity in the Godhead. It is noticeable that this preluding anticipation of the thought of the Incarnation, not recognized in the vision of Moses (Exodus 24:10) or Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), appears prominently in the two prophets of the exile - here and in the memorable Messianic vision of \"One like unto the ['a,' Revised Version] Son of man\" in Daniel 7:13. What might have been perilously anthropomorphic in the early stages of the growth of Israel, when men tended to identify the symbol with the thing symbolized, was now made subservient to the truth which underlies even anthropomorphic thought (comp. Revelation 1:13). Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:20. 10), it may be noted, dwells on the fact that Ezekiel uses the words, \"'haec visio similitudmis gloriae Domini,' ne quis putaret forte eum in his proprie vidisse Deum.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - As the colour of amber. The \"amber\" (see note on ver. 4) represents the purity and glory of the Divine nature - the truth that \"God is light\" in his eternal essence. The \"fire\" which, here as ever, represents the wrath of God against evil, is round about within it, i.e. is less absolutely identified with the Divine will, of which it is yet an almost constant manifestation. It is, in the language of the older logicians, an inseparable accident rather than part of its essential nature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - As the appearance of the bow. The glorious epiphany was completed, as in Revelation 4:3 and Revelation 10:1, by the appearance of the rainbow. The symbol of God's faithfulness, and of the hope that rested on it (Genesis 9:13). was seen in the glory of the Divine perfection, even in the midst of the fire of the Divine wrath. Mercy and love are thought of as over arching all the phenomena of the world and its history, attempering the chastisements which are needed for those with whom that love is dealing. The whole complex appearances of Ezekiel's descriptions, including the arch of prismatic colours, finds its nearest natural analogue, as has been before suggested (note on ver. 4), in the phenomena of the Northern Lights. I fell upon my face. As in Ezekiel 3:23; Daniel 8:17; Revelation 1:17, the prostrate attitude of lowliest adoration, the dread and awe of one who has seen the King, the Lord of hosts, and vet survives, was a preparation for the more direct revelation to his consciousness of the Word and will of Jehovah (comp. Dante 'Inferno,' 3:136; 5:142).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - A new date is given, and includes what follows to Ezekiel 23:49. The last note of time was in Ezekiel 8:1, and eleven months and five days had passed, during which the prophecies of the intervening chapters had been written or spoken. We may note further that it was two years one month and five days after the prophet's call to his work (ch. 1.), and two years and five months before the Chaldeans besieged Jerusalem (Ezekiel 24:1). The immediate occasion here, as in Ezekiel 8:1, was that some of the elders of Israel bad come to the prophet to inquire what message of the Lord he had to give them in the present crisis. Whether any stress is to be laid on the fact that here the elders are said to be \"of Israel,\" and in Ezekiel 8:1 \"of Judah,\" is doubtful (see note on Ezekiel 14:1). Ezekiel seems to use the two words as interchangeable. Here, however, it is stated more definitely that they came to inquire, probably in the hope that he would tell them, as other prophets were doing, that the time of their deliverance, and of that of Jerusalem, was at hand. Passing into the prophetic state, Ezekiel delivers the discourse that follows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to inquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - As I live, saith the Lord God, etc. The inquirers are answered, but not as they expected. Instead of hearing of the \"times and seasons\" of the events that were in the near future, the prophet at once enters on his stern work as a preacher. The general principle that determines the refusal to answer has been given in Ezekiel 14:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4 - Wilt thou judge them, etc.? The doubled question has the force of a strong imperative. The prophet is directed, as it were, to assume the office of a judge, and as such to press home upon his hearers, and through them upon others, their own sins and those of their fathers. He is led, in doing so, to yet another survey of the nation's history; not now, as in Ezekiel 16, in figurative language, but directly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - In the day that I lifted up mine hand. The attitude was that of one who takes an oath (Exodus 6:8), and implies the confirmation of the covenant made with Abraham. The land flowing with milk and honey appears first in Exodus 3:8, and became proverbial. The glory of all lands is peculiar to Ezekiel. Isaiah (Isaiah 13:19) applies the word to Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - No special mention of the idols of Egypt occurs in the Pentateuch, but it lies, in the nature of the case, that this was the form of idolatry implied in the second commandment, and the history of the \"golden calf\" (Exodus 32:4) shows that they had caught the infection of the Mnevis or Apis worship while they sojourned in Egypt. Here apparently the prophet speaks of that sojourn prior to the mission of Moses. In bold anthropomorphic speech he represents Jehovah as half purposing to make an end of the people there and then, and afterwards repenting. He wrought for his Name's sake, that the deliverance of the Exodus might manifest his righteousness and might, the attributes specially implied in that Name, to Egypt and the surrounding nations. They should not have it in their power to say that he had abandoned the people whom he had chosen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I gave them my statutes, etc. Ezekiel recognizes, almost in the very language of Deuteronomy 30:16-20, as fully as the writers of Psalm 19. and 119. recognized, the excellence of the Law. A man who kept that Law in its fulness would have life in its fullest and highest sense. He was beginning, however, to recognize, as Jeremiah had (lone (Jeremiah 31:31), the powerlessness of the Law to give that life without the aid of something higher. The \"new covenant\" was already dawning on the mind of the scholar as on that of the master.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I gave them my sabbaths, etc. As in Exodus 31:12-17, the sabbath is treated as the central sign (we might almost say sacrament) of the Jewish Church, not only as a mark differencing them from other nations, but as between Jehovah and them, a witness of their ideal relation to each other, a means of making that ideal relation a reality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - It is hardly necessary to count up the several instances of rebellion, from the sin of the golden calf onward. Of direct violation of the sabbath we have but two recorded instances (Exodus 16:27; Numbers 15:32); but the prophet looked below the surface, and would count a mere formal observance, that did not sanctify the sabbath, as a pollution of the holy day. (For parallel teaching in the prophets, see Isaiah 56:2-4; Isaiah 58:13; Jeremiah 17:21-27; and later on in the history, probably as the result of their teaching, Nehemiah 10:31-33; Nehemiah 13:15-22.) Then I said. The history of Numbers 14:26 and Numbers 26:65 was probably in Ezekiel's thoughts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Their heart went after their idols. The words may point generally to the fact that the idolatrous tendencies of the people, though suppressed, were not really eradicated. The history of Baal-peor (Numbers 25:3-9) shows how ready they were to pass into act, and Amos 5:25, 26 implies a tradition of other like acts during the whole period of the wanderings in the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I said unto their children, etc. The words can refer to nothing but the great utterance of the Book of Deuteronomy as addressed to the children of those who had perished in the wilderness. That utterance also, it is implied, as indeed the Baal-peor history at the close of the forty years showed, fell on deaf ears. Then also there was, once again, in the inevitable anthropomorphic language, a change of purpose, from that of a rigorous judgment to the mercy which prevailed against it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - That I would scatter them among the heathen. The words seem to refer to the generation that had grown up in the wilderness, and, so taken, do not correspond with the history of the conquest of Canaan. What Ezekiel contemplates, however, as the resolve of Jehovah, is the commutation of the sentence of destruction for that of the dispersion of the people, leaving the time and manner of that dispersion to be determined by his own will. Possibly even in the time of the judges, with its many conquests and long periods of oppression, there were instances of such dispersion, and these, with others that would naturally accompany an invasion like that of Shishak (2 Chronicles 12:2-9), not to speak of frequent attacks from Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, Edomites, and Syrians, may have seemed to the prophet the working out, step by step, of the dispersion which culminated in the deportation of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser, and of Judah and Benjamin by Nebuchadnezzar. Traces of such dispersions before Ezekiel's time meet us in Psalm 78:59-64; Isaiah 11:11, 12; Zephaniah 3:10, 20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I gave them also statutes that were not good, etc. The words have sometimes been understood as though Ezekiel applied these terms to the Law itself, either as speaking of what St. Paul calls its \"weak and beggarly elements\" (Galatians 4:9), or as unable to work out the righteousness which it commanded (Romans 3:20), and the language of Hebrews 7:19 and Hebrews 10:1 has been urged in support of this view. One who has studied Ezekiel with any care will not need many words to show that such a conclusion was not in his thoughts at all. For him the Law was \"holy and just and good,\" and its statutes such that a man who should keep them should even live in them (vers. 13, 21). He is speaking of the time that followed on the second publication of that Law, and what he Says is that the people who rebelled against it were left, as it were, to a law of another kind. The baser, darker forms of idolatry are described by him, with a grave irony, as statutes and judgments of another kind, working, not life, but death. Sin became, by God's appointment, the punishment of sin, that it might be manifest as exceeding sinful. So Stephen says of Israel that \"God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven\" (Acts 7:42). So St. Paul paints the corruptions of the heathen world as the result of God's giving them up to \"vile affections\" (Romans 1:24, 25). So in God's future dealings with an apostate form of Christianity, the same apostle declares that \"God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie\" (2 Thessalonians 2:11). Psalm 81:12 may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts as asserting the same general law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I polluted them through their own gifts. The noun includes all forms of blessing bestowed on Israel - its corn and wine and oil (see Ezekiel 16:19, 20), even its sons and daughters, the fruit of the womb, as well as the increase of the earth. (For the prevalence of Moloch worship, and for the phrase, \"pass through,\" see notes on Ezekiel 16:21.) The sins were to bring desolation as their punishment, and then men would learn to know Jehovah as indeed he is.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - It was a special aggravation of the sin that it was committed in the very land into which they had been brought by the oath (the \"hand lifted up\") of Jehovah, that it might be a holy land, a witness of the Divine righteousness to the nations round about. The forms of worship include that of the high places, and the thick trees (Isaiah 57:5; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:6) width witnessed the cultus of the Asherah or of Ashtaroth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - What is the high place, etc.? Bamah, in the plural Bamoth, was the Hebrew for \"high place.\" At first it was applied to the hill on which some local sanctuary stood (1 Samuel 9:12; 1 Kings 3:4), but was gradually extended, after the building of the temple as the one appointed sanctuary, to other places which were looked upon as sacred, and which became the scenes of an idolatrous and forbidden worship. Ezekiel emphasizes his scorn by a conjectural derivation of the word, as if derived from the two words ba (\"go\") and mah (\"whither\"); or, perhaps, What comes? (comp. Exodus 16:15 for a parallel derivation of the word marones). Taking the words in their ordinary sense, they seem to express only a slight degree of contempt. \"What, then, is the place to which you go?\" - what is the \"whither\" to which it leads? But I incline (with Ewald and Smend) to see in the word \"go into\" the meaning which it has in Genesis 16:2 and Genesis 19:31, and elsewhere, as a euphemism for sexual union. So later the word \"Bamah\" becomes a witness that those who worship in the high place go there (as in ver. 30) to commit whoredom literally and spiritually. Its name showed that it was what I have called \"a chapel of prostitution\" (ch. 16:24, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Say ye unto the house of Israel, etc. The words are addressed primarily to the elders who had come to consult the prophet (ver. 1), but through them to all their contemporaries and fellow countrymen. They still in heart and even in deed (comp. Isaiah 57:4-6, 11, and Isaiah 65:3, as showing the habits of the exiles) clung to the old idolatries. The question for them was whether they would continue to walk in the ways of their fathers. If so, it was true of them, as of the elders, that the Lent to whom they came would not be inquired of by them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - That which cometh into your mind, etc. The prophet reads tide secret thoughts of the inquirers. If the temple were destroyed, they thought, then the one restraint on the idolatries they loved would be removed. They would be no longer a separate people, and would be free to adopt the cultus of the heathen among whom they lived. If that was not Jehovah's purpose for them, then there must be no destruction of the temple, no dispersion among the nations. They come to Ezekiel to know which of the two alternatives he, as the prophet of Jehovah, has in store, and his answer is that he is bound to nether. They could not abdicate their high position, and would remain under the burden of its responsibilities. Scattered though they might be among the heathen, yet even there the \"mighty hand and the stretched-out arm\" (we note the phrases as from Deuteronomy 4:34; Deuteronomy 5:15) would hunt them down, and punish them for their iniquities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - The prophet's words seem to look beyond the horizon of any fulfilment as yet seen in history, of which the return of the exiles under Zerubbabel was but the pledge and earnest. He contemplates not a return straight from Babylon to Jerusalem, but a gathering from all the countries in which they had been scattered (Isaiah 11:11). When gathered, the whole nation is to be brought into the wilderness of the peoples, bordered by many nations. This may probably point to the great Syro-Arabian desert lying between Babylon and Palestine. This was to be to them what the wilderness of Sinai had been in the time of the Exodus. There Jehovah would plead with them face to face, in the first instance as an accuser. (For face to face, as expressing the direct revelation of Jehovah, see Exodus 33:11; Deuteronomy 5:4; Deuteronomy 34:10, and elsewhere.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLike as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - I will cause you to pass under the rod. The \"rod\" (same word as in Psalm 23:4) is primarily that of chastisement, but it is also that of the shepherd who gathers in his flock (Ezekiel 34:11; Leviticus 27:32; Micah 7:14). Into the bond of the covenant. The word for \"bond\" (only found here in the Old Testament) is probably cognate with that for \"fetter\" or \"bond\" (Isaiah 52:2; Jeremiah 5:5; Jeremiah 27:2). The chastisement was, for those who accepted it, to do its work by restoring the blessings of the covenant which apostasy had forfeited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - The thought of the shepherd suggests, as in Matthew 25:33, the separation of the sheep from the goats. The land of the restored Israel was to be a land of righteousness, and the rebels were not to enter into it. Was Ezekiel thinking of those who were thus to die in the \"wilderness of the peoples\" as a counterpart of those who perished in the forty years of the wandering, and did not enter Canaan? Ver. 36 seems to imply that he was looking for a repetition of that history. The solemn fast kept by Ezra by the river of Ahava (Ezra 8:21-22) may be noted as corresponding, on a small scale, to Ezekiel's expectations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Go ye, serve every man his idols, etc. The command comes as with a grave irony. \"Be at least consistent. Sin on, if it is your will to sin; but do not make the sin worse by the hypocrisy of an unreal worship, and mix up the name of Jehovah with the ritual of Moloch\" (comp. Joshua 24:19, 20). The margin of the Revised Version, with not a few critics (Keil), gives, \"but hereafter surely ye shall hearken unto me\" (\"if not\" equivalent to \"ye shall,\" as in the familiar idiom of Psalm 95:11, where \"if\" is equivalent to \"shall not\"). So taken, the verse looks forward to what follows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - From the earlier stage of the restoration the prophet passes on to its completion. The people have come to the mountain of the height of Israel (Micah 4:1, 2; Isaiah 2:2, 3). Ezekiel sees an Israel that shall at last be worthy of its name, the worship of false gods rooted out forever. The all of them points to the breaking down of the old division between Israel and Judah (Isaiah 11:13). Jehovah would accept the \"heave offering\" (same word as in Exodus 24:27; Leviticus 7:14, et al.) and other oblations. The fact that Israel itself is said to be the \"sweet savour\" (Revised Version) which Jehovah accepts (comp. 2 Corinthians 2:15; Ephesians 5:2; Philippians 4:18) suggests a like spiritual interpretation of the other offerings, though the literal meaning was probably dominant in the prophet's own thoughts. The nearest approach to a parallelism in a later age is that presented by Romans 9-11; but it is noticeable how there St. Paul avoids any words that imply the perpetuation of the temple and its ritual, and confines himself to the spiritual restoration of his brethren according to the flesh. It was given to him to see, what the prophets did not see, that that perpetuation would frustrate the purpose of the restoration; that the temple and its ritual took their places among the things that \"were decaying and waxing old,\" and were ready to vanish away (Hebrews 8:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - I will be sanctified in you, etc. God is sanctified when he is manifested and recognized as holy (Leviticus 10:3; Numbers 20:13). That recognition would be the consequence of the restoration of Israel, for then it would be seen, even by the heathen, that the God of Israel had been holy and just and true in his judgments, and that he seeks to make men partakers of his holiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And there shall ye remember, etc. The words stretch far and wide, and throw light on many of the problems that connect themselves with the conversion of the sinner and the eschatology of the Divine government. The whole evil past is still remembered after repentance and forgiveness. There is no water of Lethe, such as the Greeks fabled, such as Dante dreamt of as the condition of entering Paradise ('Purg.,' 31:94-105). The self-loathing and humility which grow out of that memory, the acceptance of all the punishment of the past as less than had been deserved, - these are the conditions and safeguards of the new blessedness. Ezekiel teaches us, i.e., that it is possible to conceive of an eternal punishment, the punishment of memory, shame, self-loathing, as compatible with eternal life. So (in ver. 44) the prophet ends what is perhaps, the profoundest and the noblest of his discourses, his \"vindication of the ways of God to man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - In the Hebrew the verses that follow form the opening of the next chapter. The Authorized Version follows the LXX., the Vulgate, and Luther. The section has clearly no connection with what has preceded, and, though fragmentary in its character, seems by the words, \"set thy face,\" to connect itself with Ezekiel 21:2, and to lead up to it. The words of ver. 45 imply, as always, an interval of silence and repose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - Drop thy word. The verb is used specially of prophetic utterances (Ezekiel 21:2; Amos 7:6; Micah 2:6, 11), and stands, therefore, in the Hebrew without an object. Toward the south. Three distinct words are used in the Hebrew for the thrice-repeated \"south\" of the Authorized Version.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) One which primarily means \"the region on the right hand,\" sc. as a man looks to the east. which Ezekiel also uses in Ezekiel 47:19; Ezekiel 48:28);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the \"shining land,\" used repeatedly in Ezekiel 40, 42. (Deuteronomy 33:23; Job 37:17; Ecclesiastes 1:6; Ecclesiastes 11:3); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the Negeb, the \"dry\" or \"parched\" land, the South (always in Revised Version with a capital letter), of Joshua 15:21, and the historical books generally, the region lying to the south of Judah. The use of the three words where one might have sacrificed is, perhaps, characteristic of Ezekiel's affluence of diction. The LXX. treats all three as proper names, and transliterates them as Thaiman, Darom, and N'ageb. Against this region and its inhabitants (they, of course, are the \"trees\") Ezekiel is directed to utter his words of judgment. The parenthesis in the last sentence gives the key to the prophet's cypher writing. From Ezekiel's standpoint on the Chebar, the whole of Judah is as the forest of the south. The \"green tree,\" as in Psalm 1:1, 2, is the man who is relatively righteous; the \"dry tree\" is the sinner whose true life is withered; the \"fire\" the devastation wrought by the Chaldean invaders, as executing the Divine judgment. In our Lord's words in Luke 23:31 we may probably find an echo of Ezekiel's imagery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - All faces from the south to the north, etc. The phrase seems, at first, to pass from the figure to the reality. Possibly, however, face may stand for \"the outward appearance,\" the leaves and branches, of the trees. \"From the south (Negeb) to the north\" takes the place of the older \"from Dan to Beersheba\" (Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20). Of that \"fire\" of judgment, it is said, as in our Lord's use of a like imagery, that it shall not be quenched (Mark 9:43). It shall do its dread work till that work is accomplished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel20:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Doth he not speak parables? We can scarcely wonder that Ezekiel's enigmatic words here, as in ch. 15, 16, and 17, should have called forth some such expression from his hearers; but he obviously records the whisper which he thus heard, in a tone of sorrow and indignation. It was to him a proof, as a like question was to the Christ (Matthew 15:16; Matthew 16:9; Mark 8:21) proof that those hearers were yet without understanding. The question was, for those who asked it, an excuse for hardening their hearts against remonstrances which needed no explanation. The indignation was followed by another interval of silence, during which he brooded over their stubbornness, and at last, in Ezekiel 21:1, the word of the Lord comes to him, and he speaks \"no more in proverbs,\" but interprets the latest parable even in its details.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - The opening words, reproducing those of Ezekiel 20:46, indicate that the interpretation of that parable is coming. So the three variants of \"south\" are shown to mean respectively Jerusalem, the holy places, and the land of Israel. So, in ver. 3, the righteous and the wicked take the place of the \"green\" and the \"dry\" tree, and the fire is explained as meaning the sword of the invader. The teaching of ch. 18, had shown that Ezekiel had entered, as regards the ultimate judgment of individual men, into the spirit of Abram's words \"That be far from thee to destroy the righteous with the wicked\" (Genesis 18:25). But in regard to temporal judgments there would be in this case, as in the complaint of Job 9:22, no distinction. The sword went forth \"against all flesh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Sigh therefore, etc. As in other instances (Ezekiel 4:4; Ezekiel 5:1-4), the prophet dramatizes the coming calamity. He is to act the part of a mourner, whose sighs are so deep that they seem to \"break his loins\" (compare, for the gesture, Nahum 2:1, 10 Isaiah 21:3; Jeremiah 30:6). The strange action was meant to lead to questions. What did it mean? And then he is to answer that he does it \"for the tidings\" which are to him as certain as if they had already come. He is but doing what all would do, when the messenger brought word, as in Ezekiel 33:21, five years later, that the city was at last smitten.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - A sword, a sword, etc. The new section (vers. 9-17) rises out of the thought of the unsheathed sword in ver. 3. More than most other portions of Ezekiel's writings, it assumes a distinctly lyrical character, and might be headed, \"The Lay of the Sword of Jehovah.\" The opening words are probably an echo of Deuteronomy 32:41. The dazzling brightness of the sword is added to its sharpness as a fresh element of terror.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The sceptre of my son, etc. The clause is obscure, possibly corrupt, and has received many interpretations.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Taking the received text, the most probable explanation is that given by Keil and Kliefoth: Shall we rejoice (saying), The sceptre of my son despiseth all woods. Here the \"rod\" is the \"sceptre\" of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10), and the words are supposed to be spoken by those who hear of the destroying sword. They need not dread the sword, they say, because the sceptre of the house of David, whom Jehovah recognizes as his son, despises all wood, looks on every other rod that is the symbol of sovereignty, with scorn. It is urged, in favour of this interpretation, that ver. 27 contains an unmistakable refer, nee to the prophetic words of Genesis 49:10.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Ewald: It is no weak rod of my son, the softest of all wood; i.e. the sword of Jehovah is no weak weapon such as might be used for the chastisement of a child (Proverbs 10:13; Proverbs 13:24).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Hengstenberg: Shall we rejoice over the rod of my son, despising every tree? There is no cause for anything but the reverse of joy in the rod, the punishment which God appoints for Israel as his son, and which surpasses all others in its severity.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The Authorized Version and Revised Version (margin) make the \"sword\" the nominative, and the words are those of Jehovah: It contemneth the rod (i.e. the sceptre) of my son, as it contemns every other tree (i.e. as in Ezekiel 20:4), every other national sovereignty.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The Revised. Version and Authorized Version (margin): It (the sword) is the rod of my son (appointed for his chastisement), and it despiseth every tree, in same sense as in (4).NEWLINENEWLINE(6) Cornill, altering the text, almost rewriting it, gets the meaning: It (the sword) is for men who murder and plunder, and regard not any strength. Neither the LXX. nor the Vulgate help us, the former giving, \"Slay, set at naught, reject every tree;\" and the latter, \"Thou who guidest the sceptre of my son, thou hast cut down.\" On the whole, (1) seems to rest on better ground than the others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Terrors by reason of the sword; better, as in the Revised Version and margin of the Authorized Version, They (the princes of Judah, corresponding to the \"rod\" of ver. 10) are delivered over to the sword with my people. At this stage, in contemplating the destruction alike of princes and of people, the prophet is bidden to make his gestures of lamentation yet more expressive, \"crying, howling, smiting on his thigh\" (Jeremiah 31:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Because it is a trial, etc. The verse has received as many interpretations, and is just as obscure as ver. 10, with which it is obviously connected. I begin as before with that which seems most probable.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Keil: For the trial is made, and what if the despising sceptre shall riot come? The \"despising sceptre\" is the kingdom of Judah, and the prophet asks, \"What will happen, what extreme of misery is to be looked for, if that kingdom shall not appear, if Judah shall be left without a ruler?NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Ewald: For it is tried - and what? Whether it is also a soft rod! That will not be. Sc. men will find on trial that the sword of Jehovah is not a soft rod, but the sharpest of all weapons.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Hengstenberg: And how? Shall the despising rod that outstript all other punishments not be? i.e. shall the sword of Jehovah not do its work effectively?NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Cornill, in part following Hitzig, again rewrites the text, and gets the meaning: How should I judge with favour? They have not turned themselves from their pollution. They shall find no place.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The Authorized Version inserts t he word \"sword,\" apparently with the meaning that the \"trial\" will show that the sword of the Lord contemns the rod, i.e. the sceptre of Judah, and that that rod shall be no more.NEWLINENEWLINE(6) The Authorized Version (margin): When the trial hath been, what then? Shall not they also belong to the despising rod? may have had a moaning for those who adopted it, but I fail to find it.NEWLINENEWLINE(7) The Revised Version relegates the Authorized Version text into the margin, and substitutes, For there is a trial, and what if even the rod that contemneth (i.e. the sceptre of Judah) shall be no more?NEWLINENEWLINE(8) The LXX and Vulgate connect \"because there is a trial\" with the preceding clause, rendering it respectively, \"for it has been justified (δεδικαίωται),\" and \"because it has been tested (probatus),\" and translate what follows - the LXX., \"What if even a tribe be repulsed? It shall not be;\" and the Vulgate, \"And this when it (the sword!) has overturned the kingdom, and it shall not be,\" etc. This will be a sufficient summary of the difficulties of the exegetical problem. At the best, we must say that it remains unsolved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Smite thine hands together, etc. Another gesture follows, either of horror and lamentation, or perhaps, looking to ver. 17, of imperative command. The sword is to do its thrice-redoubled work (the words emphasize generally the intensity, and are scarcely to be taken numerically, of the repeated invasions of the Chaldeans); it is \"the sword of the slain\" (better, pierced ones, or, with Revised Version, the deadly wounded). The next clause should be taken, with the Revised Version, in the singular - the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded; sc. the sword should smite the king as well as the people. For entereth into their privy chambers, read, with the Revised Version (margin), Ewald, and Keil, it compasseth them about.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For their ruins shall be multiplied, read, with the Revised Version, that their stumblings; and for wrapped up, pointed, or sharpened.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Go thee one way or another, etc.; i.e. as in the following, to the right hand or the left - to the north or the south. Whichever way the prophet turned (Ezekiel 20:47), he would see nothing but the sword and its work of slaughter. Jehovah had given that command with the gesture of supreme authority. He would not rest till he had appeased his wrath by letting it work itself out even to the end. With these words the \"Lay of the Sword of Jehovah\" ends, and there is again an interval of silence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-19. - The new section opens in a different strain. Ezekiel sees, as in vision, Nebuchadnezzar and his army on their march. He is told to appoint (better, make, or mark, as on a brick or tile, as in Ezekiel 4:1) a place where the road bifurcated. Both come from one land, i.e. from Babylon; but from that point onwards one road led to Rabbath, the capital of the Ammonites (Deuteronomy 3:11; 2 Samuel 11:1), the other to Jerusalem. Apparently, the exiles and the people of Judah flattered themselves that the former was the object of the expedition. The answer to that false hope is a vivid picture of what was passing in the council of war which Nebuchadnezzar was holding at that parting of the ways. The prophet sees, as it were, the sign post pointing, as with a hand, to each of the two cities The king consults his soothsayers, and uses divinations. Of these Ezekiel enumerates three:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) He shakes the arrows to and fro (Revised Version). This was known among the Greeks as the βέλομαντεια The arrows were put into a quiver, with names (in this case probably Rabbath and Jerusalem) written on them. One was then drawn, or thrown, out as by chance, and decided the direction of the campaign.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) He consults the images (Hebrew, teraphim). The modus operandi in this case is not known, but Judges 18:18 and Hosea 3:4 point to some such use of them.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) There remains the sacrifice and the inspection of the liver, familiar alike in Greek, Etrurian, and Roman divination (Cicero, 'De Divin.,' 6:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAppoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - At his right hand was, etc.; better, into his right hand came, etc.; sc. the arrow marked for Jerusalem was that which came into the king's hand as the quiver was shaken. To appoint captains; better, battering rams, in both clauses. The same Hebrew word is used in both (see note on Ezekiel 4:2). The verse paints the engineering operations of the besiegers, following on the issue of the divination. (For the mount, comp. Isaiah 37:33.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The whole verse is obscure, and has been very variously interpreted. I follow the translation of the Revised Version, and explain it by inserting words which are needed to bring out its meaning: It (what Nebuchadnezzar has done) shall be as a vain divination in their sight (sc. in that of the men of Jerusalem), which have sworn unto them (sc. have taken oaths of fealty to the Chaldeans, and are ready to take them again), but he (Nebuchadnezzar) brings iniquity to remembrance. The fact represented is that when the people of Jerusalem heard of the divination at the parting of the ways, they still lulled themselves in a false security. They and Zedekiah had sworn obedience, and that oath would protect them. \"Not so,\" rejoins the prophet; \"the Chaldean king knows how those oaths have been kept.\" The LXX. omits all reference to \"oaths.\" The Vulgate. taking the word for \"oath\" in its ether sense of \"sabbath,\" gives the curious rendering, Eritque quasi consulens frustra oraculum in eorum oculis, et sabbatorum otium imitans. In spite of the reports that reached them, the men of Jerusalem thought themselves as safe as if the Chaldean king were keeping a sabbath day. Ewald partly follows the Vulgate, and renders, They believe they have weeks on weeks, i.e. will not believe that the danger is close at hand. Keil and Havernick: Oaths of oaths are theirs; i.e. they count on the oath of Jehovah, on his promises of protection, but he (Jehovah) brings iniquity to remembrance. That they may be taken; i.e. be seized by the invader and either slain or made prisonersNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The prophet adds words which in part explain these that precede. The iniquity of the people has forced, not the Chaldean king only, but Jehovah himself, to remember and to punish them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And thou, profane wicked prince of Judah, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, O deadly wounded, etc., as in ver. 29, where the same word is translated in the Authorized Version as \"slain\" The Authorized Version follows the LXX. and Vulgate, apparently in order to make the word fit in with the fact that Zedekiah was not slain, but carried into exile. The word \"deadly wounded,\" or \"sorely smitten,\" may rightly be applied to one who fell, as Zedekiah did, from his high estate. From the sins of the people the prophet turns to the special guilt of Zedekiah, who had proved unfaithful alike to Jehovah and to the Chaldean king, whom he had owned as his suzerain. His day had at last come, the time of the iniquity of the end of the last transgression which was to bring down on him the final punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Remove the diadem, etc. The noun is used throughout the Pentateuch (e.g., Exodus 28:4; 37:39; Leviticus 8:9; Leviticus 16:4) for the \"turban\" or \"mitre\" of the high priest, and Keil so takes it here, as pointing to the punishment of the priest as well as of the king. This shall not be the same; literally, this shall not be this; or, as the Revised Version paraphrases, this shall be no more the same; i.e. the mitre and the crown shall alike pass away - taken from their unworthy wearers. There was to be, as in the following words, a great upturning of all things; the high brought low, the lowly exalted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I will overthrow. The sentence of destruction is emphasized, after the Hebrew manner, by a threefold iteration (Isaiah 6:3; Jeremiah 22:29). It shall be no more. The pronoun in both clauses probably refers to the established order of the kingdom and the priesthood. \"That order,\" Ezekiel says, \"shall be no more.\" Keil, however, takes the second \"it\" - the \"this\" of the Revised Version - as meaning the fact of the overthrow. That also was not final; all things were as in a state of flux till the Messianic kingdom hinted at in the next clause should restore the true order. Until he come whose right it is. The words contain a singularly suggestive allusion to Genesis 49:10, where a probable interpretation of the word \"Shiloh\" is \"he to whom it belongs;\" or, as the LXX. gives it, τὰ ἀποκείμενα αὐτᾷ. The passage is noticeable as being Ezekiel's first distinct utterance of the hope of a personal Messiah. Afterwards, in Ezekiel 34:23, it is definite enough.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Thus saith the Lord God concerning the Ammonites. Ezekiel has not forgotten that scene at the parting of the ways. The Ammonites, when they saw the issue of the divination, and the march of the Chaldean army to the west, thought themselves safe. They took up their reproach against Jerusalem, and exulted in its fall. They are warned, as in another strophe of the \"Lay of the Sword of Jehovah,\" that their confidence is vain (comp. Zephaniah 2:8 for a like exultation at an earlier period).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Whiles they see, etc. The words may possibly refer to Nebuchadnezzar's diviners in ver. 21, but more probably to those whom the Ammonites themselves consulted. The pronoun \"thee\" in both clauses refers to Ammon. The result of those who divined falsely was that the sword would be drawn against the necks of the Ammonites and threw them upon the heap of the slaughtered ones. For them, as in the words that end the verse, reproducing those of ver. 25, punishment is decreed, and that punishment will come.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Shall I cause it, etc.? The question of the Authorized Version suggests a negative answer, as though the speaker were Jehovah, and the sheath that of his sword. The Revised Version, which translates it, with Keil, the LXX., and the Vulgate, as an imperative, deals with it as addressed to the Ammonites. They am told to sheath their sword; it would be of no avail against the sharp, glittering weapon of Jehovah. Their judgment would soon come on them in their own land, not, as in the case of Judah, in the form of exile (comp. Ezekiel 25:1-8 as an expansion of the prophet's thought).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - I will blow against, etc. The imagery of fire takes the place of that of the sword. The brutish men (same word as in Psalm 49:10; Psalm 92:6) are the Chaldean conquerors. The fact that the adjective may also mean \"those that burn\" may, in part, have determined Ezekiel's choice of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel21:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - For Ammon there is no hope of a restoration like that which Ezekiel speaks of as possible for Jerusalem, and even for Sodom and Samaria. Its doom is written in the words, it shall be no more remembered (comp. Ezekiel 25:7).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - Moreover, etc. The word connects what follows with the word of the Lord which began in Ezekiel 20:2. That connection is, indeed, sufficiently indicated by the recurrence of the formula, \"Wilt thou judge?\" (see note on Ezekiel 20:4). In obedience to the commands which that question implied, Ezekiel has once more to go through the catalogue of the sins of Judah and Jerusalem. It is not without significance that he applies the very epithet of bloody city (Hebrew, oily of bloods) which Nahum (Nahum 3:1) had applied to Nineveh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The city sheddeth blood, etc. As in the great indictment of Isaiah (Isaiah 1:15, 21; Isaiah 4:4), the sins of murder and idolatry are grouped together. She sins as if with the purpose \"that her time\" (i.e. the time of her punishment) \"may come.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou hast caused thy days to draw near, etc. As in Ver. 3, the days and the years are those of God's judgments. The people had made no effort to avert their doom by repentance. They had, as it were, rushed upon their appointed fate. So, though in another sense, the righteous lives of the faithful are said, in 2 Peter 3:12, to \"hasten the coming of the day of God.\" Exceptional evil and exceptional good alike hasten the approach of the day which is to decide between the two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThose that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Those that be near, etc. The Hebrew words are both feminine, and refer to the neighboring and distant cities which took up their proverbs of reproach against the city, once holy and faithful, now infamous (Hebrew, defiled in name) and much vexed. The last words point to another form of punishment. Jerusalem is described as in a state of moral tumult and disorder as the consequence of its guilt (comp. Amos 3:9; Deuteronomy 7:23; Zechariah 14:13, where the same word is rendered by \"tumults\" and \"destruction\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Behold, the princes of Judah, etc. For the \"bloodshed,\" which was conspicuous among the sins, comp. Ezekiel 9:9; Ezekiel 16:38; Ezekiel 23:37, 45; and for special instances of that sin among its princes, those of Manasseh (2 Kings 21:16) and Jehoiakim (2 Kings 24:4). To their power; Hebrew, each man according to his arm, i.e. his strength. There was no restraint upon the doer of evil other than the limitation of his capacity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - We pass to sins of another kind. The fifth commandment was trampled underfoot as well as the sixth, and the blessing of continued national existence (Exodus 20:12) was thereby forfeited. The widow and the orphan and the stranger (we note in that last word the width of Ezekiel's sympathies) were oppressed (compare the same grouping in Deuteronomy 27:16, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Mine holy things, etc. The words take in the whole range of Divine ordinances as affecting both things and persons. (For \"profaning sabbaths,\" see Ezekiel 20:16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Men that carry tales, etc. Hebrew, men of slanders (comp. Exodus 23:1; Leviticus 19:16). The sin of the informers, ever ready to lend themselves to plots against the life or character of the innocent, was then, as at all times, the besetting evil of corrupt government in the East. Compare the story of Naboth (1 Kings 21:10) and of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 37:13). (For eating on the mountains, see note on Ezekiel 18:6; and for lewdness, that on Ezekiel 16:43.) What the lewdness consisted in is stated in the following verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This, well-nigh the vilest of all forms of incest, against which the horror naturalis of the heathen, as in the story of Hippolytus, uttered its protest, would seem to have been common among the corruptions of Israel (Amos 2:7; comp. 1 Corinthians 5:1). (For the sin described in the second clause, see notes on Ezekiel 18:6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11 ,12. - The list of sins follows on the lines of Leviticus 18:9, 15. (For those in Ver. 12, see notes on Ezekiel 18:12.) It is to be remarked, however, that the prophet does not confine himself to the mere enumeration of specific sins. These are traced to their source in that \"forgetting God\" which was at once the starting-point and the consummation of all forms of evil (comp. Romans 1:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I have smitten my hand. The gesture, as in Ezekiel 21:14, 17, was one of indignant, and, as it were, impatient command.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Can thine heart endure, etc.? The question implies an answer in the negative. Heart would fail and hands wax feeble in the day of the Lord's judgment. The doom of exile and dispersion must come, with all its horrors; but even here, Judah was not, like Ammon to be forgotten (Ezekiel 21:32). Her punishment was to do its work, and to consume her filthiness out of her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou shalt take thine inheritance, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, Keil, and most other commentators, shalt be profaned in thyself, etc. The prophet is still speaking of punishment, not of restoration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The house of Israel is to me become dross, etc. A new parable, based upon Isaiah 1:22, 23 and Jeremiah 6:80, begins, and is carried out with considerable fullness. In Malachi 3:2, 3 we have the same imagery. Baser metals have been mingled with the silver, and must be burnt out, but there is hope, as well as terror, in the parable. Men throw the mixed metals into the smelting-pot in order that the silver may be separated from the dross and come out pure (comp. 1 Peter 1:7). And this was to be the issue of the \"fiery trial\" through which Jerusalem and its inhabitants were to pass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - A fresh section opens, and the prophet addresses himself, not to Jerusalem only, but to the whole land. A land that is not cleansed. The words admit of the rendering, not shined upon, and this is adopted by Keil. The land is deprived at once of the sunshine and the rain. which are the conditions of fertility. The LXX. gives \"not mined upon,\" and so the two clauses are parallel and state the same fact. So Ewald. The Vulgate gives immunda, and this is followed both by the Authorized Version and the Revised Version (comp. Isaiah 5:6; Amos 4:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - A conspiracy of prophets. The prophet's thoughts go back to Ezekiel 13:1-16, from which, in Ver. 28, he actually quotes It is probable that, in the interval, fresh tidings had reached him of the evil work which they were doing at Jerusalem. The LXX. ἀφηγούμενοι (equivalent to \"princes\") suggests that they followed a different text, and this is adopted by Keil and Hitzig. Like a roaring lion (comp. Ezekiel 19:2, 3; 1 Peter 5:8). The word probably points to the loud declamations of the false prophets (compare, as a striking parallel, Zephaniah 3:3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The sins of the prophets are followed by these of the priests. Their guilt was that they blurred over the distinction between the holy and the profane (Revised Version, \"common\"), between the clean and the unclean (comp. Ezekiel 44:23; Leviticus 10:10, where the same terms are used), in what we have learnt to call the positive and ceremonial ordinances of the Law, and so blunted their keenness of perception in regard to analogous moral distinctions. Extremes meet, and in our Lord's time the same result was brought about by an exaggerated scrupulosity about the very things the neglect of which was, in Ezekiel's time, the root of the evils which he condemns. This was true generally, conspicuously true in the case of the sabbath. Its neglect was a crying evil in Ezekiel's time, just as its exaggeration was in the later development of Judaism. Though in itself positive rather than moral, to hide the eyes from its holiness was, for these to whom the commandment had been given, an act of immorality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Wolves (comp.

The fact that the prophets are addressed here gives some force to the idea that \"chiefs\" or \"judges\" were addressed in Ver. 27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - From the classes, the prophet turns to the masses. The people of the land, the common people (2 Kings 25:3, 19), come under the same condemnation. Greed of gain, the oppression of the poor and the stranger, were seem everywhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And I sought for a man, etc. (For the imagery that follows, see Ezekiel 13:5: Psalm 106:23.) The fact stated, as in Jeremiah 5:1, is that there was no one in all Jerusalem righteous enough to be either a defender or an intercessor, none to be a \"repairer of the breach\" (Isaiah 58:12). Nothing was left but the righteous punishment proclaimed in Ver. 31.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel22:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The occurrence of proper names is almost unique in the parables of the Bible, the Lazarus of Luke 16:20 being the only other instance. Their meaning is sufficiently clear. Aholah (but both names should begin with O rather than A) means \"Her tent;\" Aholibah, \"My tent is in her.\" A parallel, which may have suggested the names, is found in the Aholibamah (equivalent to \"My tent is in the high place\") of Genesis 36:2, and another in the use of Ohel as a proper name in 1 Chronicles 3:20. The common element of the two names is the word that is commonly used for the sacred tent or tabernacle in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. The distinctive element of each points to the fact that the worship in Samaria was unauthorized. Her \"tent\" was hers, not Jehovah's. Of Jerusalem with its temple Jehovah could say, \"My tent is in her,\" and this, as magnifying her privilege, also aggravated her guilt. Keil and others take the adjective here, as in Ezekiel 16:46, as meaning \"greater\" rather than \"older.\" The former adjective is, of course, applicable to the greater power of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and, even if we retain the renderings of the Authorized Version, is probably the explanation of Samaria being named as the elder of the two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The history of both the sisters passes from the time of the Exodus to that of their separate existence, and starts, in fact, from their first intercourse with the great monarchies of Asia. So far it is less a survey of their successive stages of degradation, like that of Ezekiel 16, than a retrospect of their political alliances. Aholah played the harlot. The lovers, as in Ezekiel 16:33, are the nations with which the kings of Israel were in alliance, and of these the Assyrians are named as pre-eminent. The word neighbors, which in its literal sense is hardly applicable, is probably to be taken of spiritual affinity, or may be taken as \"come near\" is in Genesis 20:4; Ezekiel 18:6; Leviticus 20:16. The Assyrians were those who, in that sense, came near to the harlot city. We have in 2 Kings 15:20 the fact that Menahem paid tribute to Pul. Hosea 5:13 and Hosea 7:11 speak generally of such alliances. The black obelisk of Shalmaneser records the fact that Jehu paid tribute to him ('Records of the Past,' 5:41). In the last-named case the tribute consisted chiefly of vessels of gold, bowls, goblets, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Clothed with blue. The same word as that used in the description of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:4; Exodus 26:31, et al.). It was probably some hue of the Tyrian purple kind which marked the official dress of the \"captains\" of the Assyrian armies. The words, with those that follow, bring before us the magnificent array of the Assyrian cavalry - a force in which Israel, throughout its history, was deficient (Judges 5:10; Zechariah 9:9; Isaiah 36:8.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - The next two verses paint the consequence of the alliance first with Assyria and then with Egypt. She adopted the religion of Assyria, probably in the form of the worship of Ishtar (Ashtoreth) as the queen of heaven. Having done this, the kings of Israel sought to play off one kingdom against the other (see Hosea 7:11; 2 Kings 17:4). It was, in fact, the discovery of Hoshea's treachery in this matter that led Shalmaneser to besiege Samaria. The result of that siege is described in general terms in Ver. 10. She, the city of Samaria, was slain with the sword, tier sons and daughters were taken into exile. So she became famous (i.e. infamous, like the Latin famosus), literally, a name among women, so. among the neighboring nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - The issue of the Assyrian alliance in the fall of Samaria might have served as a warning to the kings of Judah. But it did not. They also 'courted the alliance of the kings of Assyria, as in the case of Ahaz (2 Kings 16:7-10) and Tiglath-Pileser. Hezekiah followed in the same line, though he too trusted in Egypt, and afterwards rebelled. Manasseh too paid tribute, and made Jerusalem the scene of a confluent idolatry, which included that of Assyria. Even Josiah went forth against Pharaoh-Necho as the faithful vassal of either Assyria or Babylon. The splendor which had fascinated Samaria fascinated her also. Here clothed most gorgeously takes the place of \"clothed in blue\" in Ver. 6, describing, probably, the same fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The sin of Judah went a stop further than that of Samaria. She courted the alliance of the Chaldeans. Probably the sojourn of Manasseh at Babylon (2 Chronicles 33:11) led him to see in that city a possible rival to Assyria. The embassy of Merodach-Baladan to Hezekiah (Isaiah 39.) implies, on the other hand, that Babylon was looking to Judah for support against Assyria. The prophet represents this political coquetting, so to speak, as another act of whoredom. Aholibah saw the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion (probably \"red ochre:\" colors seem to have been used largely both in Assyrian and Babylonian sculpture as in Egyptian, and Judah seems to have copied them, Jeremiah 22:14) and fell in love with them. As the passions of a Messalina might be roused by sensuous pictures of masculine beauty, so Judah was led on by what her envoys reported of the magnificence of the palaces, the strength of the armies, of the Chaldeans. The journey of Jonah to Nineveh, and those implied in Hosea 7:11, as well as the prophecy of Nahum, all indicate a more or less intimate knowledge of the Mesopotamian monarchies. The mission of Merodach-Baladan would be naturally followed by a return embassy from Judah. A later instance under Zedekiah meets us in Jeremiah 29:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGirded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Exceeding in dyed attire; better, with dyed turbans, or tiaras, such as are seen on the Assyrian monuments of Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Kouyunyik.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The words paint the intimate alliance, the political prostitution, as it were, involved in the alliance with Babylon. Her mind was alienated from them. Interpreted by the history, the words point to the fact that Judah soon found out how hollow was the help gained by the alliance with Babylon, and turned, after Josiah's death, to Egypt as a counterpoise. As in the history of Amnon (2 Samuel 13:15), lust, when it had wrought its will, passed into loathing and disgust. Jehoiakim and Zedekiah were examples of what we may well call this distracted policy. But, as it was, this alienation did but increase her guilt. As things were, it would have been better, as Jeremiah all along counseled, to accept the rule of the Chaldeans. The mind of Jehovah was alienated from Jerusalem as hers had been from the Chaldeans.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Yet she multiplied her whoredoms. The disappointment and failure, however, did not lead to repentance. Foreign alliances, and with them foreign idolatries, were courted more eagerly than ever, though in a different direction. The lovers were changed, but the harlotry went on.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - She doted on her paramours. Commonly the word is used of a concubine (Genesis 22:24; Judges 8:31). Here it is used in scorn of the Egyptian princes whose favor Judah courted, reminding us of Homer's Ἀχαιίδες οὐκετ Ἀχαίοι, as indicating their political weakness. All that need be said of the comparison that follows is that here also Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 5:8). What is indicated is that Judah threw herself into the idolatrous ritual of Egypt with an almost orgiastic passion. The harlot nation returned, as it were, to her first love, and renewed the whoredoms of her youth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - The lovers from whom the mind of Judah was alienated were, as in Ver. 17, the Chaldeans. With these are joined Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa. The Authorized and Revised Versions, following the LXX. take these as proper names, and Ewald Smend, and Furst find in them those of Chaldean tribes. The Vulgate, followed by Luther, gives nobiles, tyrannosque, et principes, and Keil and Hengstenberg substantially adopt this rendering, giving \"rulers, lords, and nobles.\" \"Pekod\" appears as a place in Jeremiah I. 20 (compare Schrader's 'Cuneiform Inscriptions,' 2. pp. 32, 117,120, where Shoa and Koa are identified with Medo-Elamite tribes east of the Tigris), but the ether names are unknown to history. On the whole, the balance seems in favor of the rendering in the text. With these are joined all the Assyrians, who, under Nebuchadnezzar, fought, of course, in his armies.\" Now she should see her desirable young men... riding upon horses (the prophet repeats with sarcasm the phrase of Ver. 12) in another guise than she had expected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - With chariots, wagons, and wheels, etc. The first word is only found here, and probably means\" armor.\" So the Revised Version, with weapons, chariots, and wagons. They shall judge thee according to their judgments; sc. shall execute the judgment which God has assigned to them after their own manner, so their usual cruel treatment of barbarous nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They shall take away thy nose and thine ears, etc. (For instances of this or like mutilation, in the case of prisoners of war, see the case of Zedekiah, Jeremiah 52:11; Herod., 3:69, 154.) Possibly it may have been known to Ezekiel as a punishment for the adulterer or adulteress in Egypt and other countries, and if so, he might have selected it as specially appropriate to his parable (Martial, 'Epigr.,' 2:83; 3:85). Thy residue shall be consumed with fire. The Hebrew word for \"residue\" (not that usually so translated) is the same as that previously translated \"remnant.\" In the first clause it clearly points to the men of Jerusalem who are left after the capture. In the second its meaning is determined by the fact that it follows after the deportation of the sons and daughters. All that was left - in the parable, of the mutilated trunk of the adulteress, in the history, of the devastated city, sc. the empty houses - should be destroyed by fire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt; i.e. the last political alliance between Judah and Egypt. This, together with the Egyptian cultus that accompanied it, should be made to cease. That would no longer be in the thoughts of the exiles; their hopes from that quarter were extinguished forever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Once again with incisive sarcasm the prophet reiterates the phrase of Ver. 17. The punishment should be all the more terrible as coming from those whom the adulteress had once loved with the love that had passed into loathing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - All thy labor; sc. all the results of labor, all thy wealth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-33. - I will give her cup into thine hand. (For the image of the cup as the symbol of good or evil fortune, see Psalm 23:5; Isaiah 51:17; Jeremiah 25:15; Matthew 20:22; Matthew 26:39.) The cup, in this case, was to be deep and large as that of Samaria. The adulteress was to be \"drunk, but not with wine\" (Isaiah 29:9). And that \"cup,\" over and above the laughter and derision, would contain much of unknown calamities, the astonishment and desolation of Ver. 33.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Thou shalt break the shards thereof. The picture of the desolate adulteress becomes yet more terrible. Like a forlorn and desperate castaway, she does shameful execution on herself; breaks her cup, and completes the work of mutilation in its most terrible form. That is the doom decreed for her, because she had forgotten her true husband and the love of her espousals. Revised Version gives gnaw the shards thereof, painting yet more vividly the despair of the outcast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - As often, Ezekiel emphasizes by reiteration, begins yet a fresh discourse with the same words, wilt thou judge, as in Ezekiel 20:4 and Ezekiel 22:2, and enters on another summary of the sins of the two harlot sisters, in which Moloch-worship (Ver. 37) and sabbath-breaking (Ver. 38) were conspicuous elements. The nature of the guilt is emphasized (Vers. 38, 39) by the fact that the idolatrous ritual was performed on the very day in which the people sacrificed in the temple; that it found a local habitation even there (comp. Ezekiel 8:17; 2 Kings 21; Jeremiah 32:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Ye have sent for men to come from far, etc. The words obviously refer to the embassies which had been sent from time to time by both Samaria and Jerusalem to Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon. The imagery of the earlier stage of the harlot's progress is resumed, and we have a picture almost the counterpart of that in Proverbs 7:10-21. She takes her bath, paints her eyelashes with kohol, the black pigment still used in the East, as Jezebel had done (2 Kings 9:30). She decks herself with jewels, and sits on a divan (a sofa-conch, rather than bed), and prepares a table for a banquet. And on that table are the incense and the oil, symbols alike of wealth and worship, which Jehovah claims as his, and which she offers to her lovers (comp. Ezekiel 16:13, 19; Hosea 2:5, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - A voice of a multitude, etc. The word for \"multitude\" is strictly tumult, and Keil and Currey render, The voice of tumult became still,\" sc. the threats of the alien powers whom Judah courted were for a time hushed by the tributes thus paid to them. With the men of the common sort; literally, as in the margin, of the multitude of men. Sabeans from the wilderness. The Revised Version, with Keil and almost all recent commentators, follows the margin, drunkards (LXX., οἰνώμενοι). \"Sabeans\" rests on a Jewish rendering of the text, but, as a people, the Sabeans, who dwelt south of Meroe, though named in Isaiah 45:14, were too remote to come within the horizon of the parable. What Ezekiel dwells on is the ever-growing degradation of the harlot city. Not only the officers of the Chaldeans, but the mixed multitude, the very drunkards from the wilderness of Babylon, were admitted to her embraces. Possibly the word may point to the false gods to whom libations of wine were offered, but I incline to refer it rather to those who got drunk at their idol-festivals even in Jerusalem. Drunkenness was one of the vices of the Babylonians, and the prophets, who admired the Rechabites and the Nazarites (Jeremiah 35; Amos 2:11), must have looked on Judah's participation in that sin as a measureless degradation. The bracelets and crowns symbolize the wealth and prestige which the Chaldean alliance was supposed to bring with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - The whole verse is obscure, and has been very differently rendered.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The Authorized Version may be paraphrased, \"Then said I to her that was worn out with her whoredoms, passed her prime and enfeebled, Will they (the foreign nations) commit whoredoms (enter into alliances) with her? sc. What is there to attract now? And yet the habit is inveterate. She has grown old in her vice, and cannot cease from it.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The Revised Version takes it not as a question, but as a statement: Now said I of her that was old in adulteries, Now will they commit, etc. So, in the main, Keil. The text is probably corrupt, and resists conjectural emendation. In any case the general meaning is clear. The sin is of too long standing to be cured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The righteous men are in effect the ministers of God's wrath. The doom comes at last on both the sisters, who are murderers as well as adulteresses. They shall suffer the punishment of stoning which the Law commanded (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22, 24; John 8:5), and after that their bodies were to be hacked to pieces. The result of that judgment would be that all women should learn not to do after their lewdness, i.e. that idolatry should cease from being the sin of the cities of Israel.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel23:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the ninth year. We pass from the date of Ezekiel 20:1 ( B.C. 593) to B.C. 590, and the very day is identified with that on which the army of Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem (Jeremiah 39:1; 2 Kings 25:1-12). To the prophet's vision all that was passing there was as plain as though he saw it with his own eyes. The siege lasted for about two years. The punishments threatened in Ezekiel 23, had at last come near. We may probably infer that a considerable interval of silence had followed on the Aholah and Aholibah discourse. Now the time had come to break that silence, and it was broken, after the prophet's manner, by a parable. In the \"rebellious house\" we find, as in Ezekiel 2:3 and elsewhere, primarily Ezekiel's immediate hearers, secondarily the whole house of Israel as represented by them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - Set on a pot, etc. The words contain an obvious reference to the imagery of Ezekiel 11:3-7. The people had used that imagery either in the spirit of a false security or in the recklessness of despair. It is now the prophet's work to remind them that the interpretation which he gave to their own comparison had proved to be the true one. The cauldron is the city, the fire is the invading army, the metal of the cauldron does not protect them. The pieces, the choice bones, were the princes and chief men of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Burn also the bones under it; better, with the Vulgate and Revised Version, pile the bones. The bones of animals were often used as fuel. Currey quotes an interesting passage from Livingstone's 'Last Journal,' 1. p. 347, narrating how, when the supply of ordinary fuel failed, he made his steamer work with the bones of elephants. See a like practice among the Scythians (Herod., 4:61).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Scum. The word is not found elsewhere. The Authorized Version follows the Vulgate. Keil and the Revised Version give \"rust.\" As the cauldron was of brass (Ver. 11), this must have been the verdigris which was eating into the metal, and which even the blazing fire could not get rid cf. The pieces that are to be brought out are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are to be carried into exile. There was to be \"no lot cast,\" as was often done with prisoners of war, taking every tenth man (decimating) of the captives for death or exile (comp. 2 Samuel 8:2). All alike were doomed (Joel 3:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The parable is for a moment interrupted, and Jerusalem is the murderess who has shed blood, not where the earth might cover it (Job 16:18; Isaiah 26:21), but as on the top of a rock visible in the sight of all men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city!

The verb is used in Exodus 30:33, 35, of the concoction of the anointing oil, and the cognate adjective in Job 41:31 for the \"boiling\" of the water caused by the crocodile. We are reminded of the \"bubble, bubble\" of the witches' cauldron in 'Macbeth.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Then set it empty upon the coals, etc. The empty cauldron is, of course, the city bereaved of its inhabitants. The fire must go on till the rust is consumed. There is, however, in spite of the seemingly terrible hopelessness of the sentence, a gleam of hope, as there had been in Ezekiel 16:42. When the punishment had done its full work, then Jehovah might cause his fury to rest (Ver. 13). Till then he declares, through the prophet, there will be no mitigation of the punishment. The word has gone forth, and there will be no change of purpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - She hath wearied herself with lies, etc.; better, it (keeping to the image of the cauldron) is worn out with labors; sc. with the pains taken to cleanse it, and yet the rust remains. The fire must burn, the retributive judgment must continue, till the work is done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - Behold, I take away from thee, etc. The next word of the Lord, coming after an interval, is of an altogether exceptional character, as giving one solitary glimpse into the personal home life of the prophet. The lesson which the history teaches is, in substance, the same as that of Jeremiah 16:5. The calamity that falls on the nation will swallow up all personal sorrow, but it is brought home to Ezekiel, who may have read those words with wonder, by a new and terrible experience. We are left to conjecture whether anything in the prophet's home life furnished a starting-point for the terrible message that was now borne in upon his soul. Had his wife been ill before? or, as the words, with a stroke, suggest, did it fall on him, as a thunderbolt \"out of the blue\"? I mention, only to reject, the view that the wife's death belongs as much to the category of symbolic visions as the boiling cauldron. To me such a view seems to indicate an incapacity for entering into a prophet's life and calling as great as that which sees nothing but an allegory in the history of Gomer in Hosea 2, 3. We, who accept the Scripture record as we find it, may believe that Ezekiel was taught, as the earlier prophet, to interpret his work by his own personal experience. To Ezekiel himself the loss of one who is thus described as the desire (or, delight) of his eyes (the word is used of things in 1 Kings 20:6, of young warriors in Lamentations 2:4, of sons and daughters in Ver. 25), must have been, at first, as the crowning sorrow of his life; but the feelings of the patriot-prophet were stronger even than those of the husband, and his personal bereavement seemed as a small thing compared with the desolation of his country. He was to refrain from all conventional signs of mourning, from weeping and wailing, from the loud sighing (for forbear to cry, read, with the Revised Version, sigh, but not aloud), from the head covered or sprinkled with ashes (Isaiah 61:3), and from the bare feet (2 Samuel 15:30; Isaiah 20:2), from the covered lips (Leviticus 13:45; Micah 3:7), which were \"the trappings and the garb of woe\" in such a case. Eat not the bread of men. The words point to the custom, more or less common in all nations and at all times, of a funeral feast, like the parentalia of the Romans. Wine also was commonly part of such a feast (Jeremiah 16:7). The primary idea of the custom seems to have been that the mourner's friends sent the materials for the feast as a token of their sympathy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - So I spake unto the people in the morning, etc. In yet another way the calling of the prophet superseded the natural impulses of the man. He knew that his wife's hours were numbered, yet the day was spent, not in ministering at her deathbed, but in one last effort to impress the teachings of the time upon the seared consciences and hardened hearts of his countrymen and neighbors. I cannot help referring to the poem 'Ezekiel,' by B.M., published in 1871, as expressing the meaning of the history better than any commentary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - We must read between the lines what had passed in that eventful night of sorrow. The rumor must have spread among the exiles of Tel-Abib that the prophet had lost the wife whom he loved so tenderly. They were ready, we may imagine, to offer their consolations and their sympathy. And, behold, he appears as one on whom no special sorrow had fallen. But that strange outward hardness had the effect which it was meant to have. It roused them to ask questions, and it was one of the cases in which the prudens interrogatio, which if not in itself the dimidium seientiae, at least prepared the way for it. The form of their question implies that they had a forecast that the strange conduct was, in some way, connected with the prophet's work. Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The desire of your eyes. There is something exquisitely pathetic in the iteration of the phrase of Ver. 17. To the priest Ezekiel himself, to the people whom he addressed, the temple was as dear as the wife to the husband. It was also \"the pride of their power\" (Revised Version), the \"pity of their soul\" (margin). The former phrase comes from Leviticus 26:19. When that temple should be profaned, when sons and daughters should fall by the sword, then they would do as the prophet had done. They would learn that there is a sorrow which is too deep for tears, something that passeth show. The state which the prophet describes is not one of callousness, or impenitence, or despair. The people shall mourn for their iniquities;\" this will be the beginning of repentance. Leviticus 26:39, 40 was obviously in the prophet's thoughts. We note that Ver. 24 is the one solitary passage since Ezekiel 1:3 in which Ezekiel names himself. As single acts and gestures had before (Ezekiel 4:1-12) been a sign of what was coming, so now the man himself was to be in that hour of bereavement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - Yet another sign was given, not to the people, but to the prophet himself. For the present there was to be the silence of unutterable sorrow, continuing, day after day, as there had been before (Ezekiel 3:26). Then there should come a messenger from Jerusalem, reporting its capture and destruction, and then his mouth should be opened. The messenger does not come till nearly three years afterwards (Ezekiel 33:21); and we must infer that there was no spoken message during the interval, but that from Ezekiel 25:1 onward we have the written words of the Lord that came to him from time to time, not as messages to Israel, but as bearing on the fate of the surrounding nations. We have, i.e., what is, strictly speaking, a paten-thesis in the prophet's work.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel24:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Set thy face against the Ammonites. The main facts that are essential to a right understanding of the message to this people, not to speak of their long-standing enmity against Israel for many centuries, areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that they formed part of Nebuchadnezzar's army, as allies or tributaries, against Jehoiakim (2 Kings 24:2);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that afterwards they, with other neighboring nations, intrigued with Zedekiah against the Chaldean king (Jeremiah 27:3), so that it was an open question whether his first act of vengeance should fall on Rabbath-Ammon or Jerusalem (Ezekiel 21:20). In Ezekiel 21:28-32, written not long before, Ezekiel had uttered his prediction of the coming judgment. Here we read that when they saw that Jerusalem had been laid waste, they, like Edom (Psalm 137:7), exulted in her downfall. Earlier traces of cruelty and outrage are found in Psalm 83:7; Amos 1:13 - 15; Zephaniah 2:8-11. We learn from Jeremiah 40:14 that the name of the Ammonite king at this time was Baalis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - The men of the east; Hebrew, children of the east. The name is applied in Genesis 29:1; 1 Kings 4:30; Job 1:3; Judges 6:3, 33; Judges 7:12; Judges 8:10, to the nomadic tribes, Midianites and others, which roamed to and fro in the wilderness east of Ammon and Moab, after the manner of the modern Bedouins, with their sheep and camels, and were looked upon as descendants of Ishmael. Palaces; better, with the Revised Version, encampments, or tent-villages. The word is found, in this sense, in Genesis 25:16; Psalm 69:25; Numbers 31:10. This was, probably, the immediate result of Nebuchadnezzar's march. Rabbah was left undefended, and became a stable for the camels of the Midianites and other tribes (Judges 6:5). The prediction has been slowly fulfilled. Under the Greece-Egyptian rule the city revived, was named after Ptolemy Philadel-phus, and was flourishing under the Roman Empire. Remains of temples, theatres, houses, are still found on its site, but its present desolate condition agrees with the picture drawn here by Ezekiel and in Jeremiah 49:2. The language of Jeremiah 49:6 implies captivity and a partial return from it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - A spoil to the heathen. The noun for \"spoil\" is not found elsewhere, but probably means \"food.\" The Hebrew Keri, i.e. its marginal reading, gives the same word as that rendered \"spoil\" in Ezekiel 27:5. The meaning is substantially the same whichever word we choose. Ezekiel, it will be noticed, says nothing about the return of the Ammonites, but contemplates, as in Ezekiel 21:32, entire destruction. The moaning of Rabbah (\"great\" or \"populous\"), the mother-city of Ammon, gives greater force to the prophecy of desolation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moab and Seir. \"Seir\" stands elsewhere for Edom, but here appears as distinguished from it, the latter nation having a distinct message in Ver. 12. A possible explanation is found in 2 Chronicles 20:23, where we find Moab and Ammon joined together against the inhabitants of Mount Seir. The Moabites may have retained possession of it, and so Ezekiel may have coupled the two names together. Their sin also, like that of Ammon, is that they exulted in the fall of Jerusalem. It was come down to the level of other cities, no longer exalted above them by the blessing of Jehovah. The Moabite Stone, found in the ruins of Dibon ('Records of the Past,' 9:165), on which Mesha, King of Moab, narrates his conquests over neighboring nations, including Israel, testifies to the strength of the kingdom, and in Isaiah 15. and 16. it is represented as conspicuous for its pride. They too, like the Ammonites, served in Nebuchadnezzar's army (2 Kings 24:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will open the side of Moab; literally, the shoulder, i.e. the slopes of the mountain of Moab (Joshua 15:8, 10). For Beth-jeshimoth (equivalent to \"House of wastes\"), see Numbers 33:49; Joshua 12:3; Joshua 13:20. It had been assigned to Reuben, but had been seized by the Moabites. It has been identified by De Sauley with the ruins now known as Suaime, on the northeastern border of the Dead Sea. Baal-moon (Numbers 32:38), more fully Beth-baal-meon (Joshua 13:17), or Beth-moon (Jeremiah 48:23). The name is found in ruins of some extent, known as the fortress of Mi'un or Maein, about three miles south of Heshbon ('Dict. Bible,' s.v.). Kiriathaim. The dual form of the name (equivalent to \"Two cities\") implies, perhaps, the union of an old and new town, or two towns on the opposite sides of a brook or wady. The name appears in Genesis 14:5; Numbers 32:37; Joshua 13:19; Jeremiah 48:1, 23. It has been identified with El-Teym, about two miles from Medeba (Burckhardt), and with Kurei-yat, on the south side of Jebel Attarus. Eusebius ('Onom.,' s.v.) describes it as about ten miles from Medeba, and close to the Baris, lint nothing is known as to the last-named place. The three cities all belonged to the region which Sihon and Og had conquered from the Moabites before Israel obtained possession of them, and they were afterwards claimed as belonging to the Israelites by right of conquest (Judges 11:23), and them may therefore be a touch of irony in Ezekiel's language describing them as Moabite cities. Collectively they were the glory of the country, the region known as the Belka, in which they were situated, giving the best pasturage, then as now, in Southern Syria. Havernick quotes a Bedouin proverb, \"There is no land like Belka\" (see Tristram's 'Land of Moab,' pp. 275, 303-305, 350). Kirjath and Baal-meon appear in Mesha's inscription on the Moabite Stone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites. The Authorized Version is obscure. What is meant is that the Moabites as well as the Ammonites were to be given to the nomadic tribes, the \"children of the east,\" for a possession. The doom that Ammon was to be no more remembered (Ezekiel 21:32) was to be carried out to the uttermost, and the children of the east were to complete what Nebuchadnezzar had begun. The utter destruction of Ammon was, as it were, uppermost in the prophet's thoughts, and that of Moab was but secondary. Historically, the words received a partial fulfillment in Nebuchadnezzar's conquests five years after the destruction of Jerusalem (Josephus,' Ant.,' 10:9.7, and M. yon Niebuhr's 'Geseh. Assurs,' p. 215), but the Ammonites were still an important people in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 5:6, 30-45) and Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Trypho, p. 272).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah, etc. The statement receives many illustrations, notably in Psalm 137:7, and at an earlier date in Amos 1:11; Obadiah 1:11. What had been malicious exultation (the ἐπιχαιρεκακία, which Aristotle describes as the extremest type of evil) passed in the case of Edom into overt acts of hostility. The moment of Judah's weakness was seized on as an opportunity for gratifying what Ezekiel elsewhere (Ezekiel 35:5) calls the \"perpetual hatred\" of the people against Israel, for taking vengeance for the primal wrong which Esau had suffered at the hand of Jacob (Genesis 27:36). (For other prophecies against Edom, see Numbers 24:18, 19; Isaiah 11:14; Jeremiah 49:7-12; Joel 3:19.) Teman. The name, which signifies \"South,\" was probably applied to a district - twice, here and in Jeremiah 49:7, 8, coupled with Dedan. In Jeremiah 49:20, 21 the cry of the inhabitants of Teman is said to have been \"heard in the Red Sea,\" and this determines its geographical position, as being, in accordance with its name, the southern region of Edom. In Job 2:11 we have Eliphaz the Temanite as one of the patriarch's friends, and the same name appears as that of a son of Esau (Genesis 36:11). In Jeremiah (loc. cit.) Teman is named as famous for its wisdom. Dedan is named as a grandson of Cash in Genesis 10:7, and of Abraham by Keturah in Genesis 25:3. It has been inferred from this that there were two branches of the nation, one on the shores of the Persian Gulf, nomadic and trading, as in the \"travelling companies\" of Dedanim (Isaiah 21:13; Ezekiel 27:15, 20); the other settled in the territory of the Edomites ('Dict. Bible'). The latter is that to which Ezekiel refers. A various punctuation gives, with a better sense, \"From Teman even unto Dedan they shall fall by the sword.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - By the hand of my people Israel: The words received a fulfillment in the conquest of Edom by John Hyrcanus, who compelled its people to receive circumcision (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:09. 1). In Amos 9:12 its subjugation is connected with the Messianic prophecy that the fallen tabernacle of David should be raised up. There is an obvious emphasis in the repetition of the word vengeance. The law of a Divine retribution will work out its appointed purpose-vengeance to those who sought vengeance. They (the Edomites) shall reap as they have sown, and shall know that the vengeance of Jehovah is more terrible than their own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The sin of the Philistines is virtually the same as that of the Edomites. They also had a perpetual hatred. Century after century they had been, with various fortunes, the enemies of Israel - defeated (to confine ourselves to more recent history) by Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 17:11) and Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6), formidable under Jehoram (2 Chronicles 21:16) and Ahaz (2 Chronicles 28:18), repressed by Hezekiah (Isaiah 14:31), combining with Amalek, and Ammon, and Tyre, and Assyria against Jerusalem (Psalm 83:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The Cherethims. The name appears, coupled with the Philistines, in Zephaniah 2:5, and has been supposed to be connected with Crete as the region from which they came, or in which they afterwards settled. By many writers both names are identified with the Cherethites and Pelethites, who appear as David's body-guard in 2 Samuel 8:18; 2 Samuel 15:18, et al., and who are supposed to represent a body of mercenary or subject troops formed out of the two nations. Both Ezekiel and Zephaniah connect the Cherethims with a paronomasia, the verb I will cut off being almost identical in sound with it. (For other prophecies, see Isaiah 11:14; Isaiah 14:29-31; Jeremiah 47; Joel 3:4; Amos 1:6-8; Zephaniah 2:4-7; Zechariah 9:4-7.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the eleventh year, etc. The last date given (Ezekiel 24:1) was the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year (sc. B.C. 590). We have now come to the eleventh year, on which, on the ninth day of the fourth month, Jerusalem was taken, while its destruction followed in the seventh day of the fifth month (Jeremiah 52:6, 12). Here the number of the month is not given in the Hebrew or the Vulgate, while the LXX. inserts the \"first month.\" In Ezekiel 32:17 we have a like omission, and in both cases it is natural to assume an error of transcription. The tidings of the capture may have reached both Tyre and Tel-Abib, and Ezekiel may have heard of the temper in which the former had received them, just as he had heard how the nations named in the previous chapter had exulted in the fall, imminent and, as they thought, inevitable, of the holy city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Because that Tyrus, etc. As the nearest great commercial city, the Venice of the ancient world, Tyre, from the days of David (2 Samuel 5:11) and Solomon (1 Kings 5:1) onward, had been prominent in the eyes of the statesmen and prophets of Judah; and Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of Joel 3:4; Amos 1:9, 10; Isaiah 23, in dealing with it. The description in Vers. 5 and 14 points, not to the city on the mainland, the old Tyre of Joshua 19:29, which had been taken by Shalmaneser and was afterwards destroyed by Alexander the Great, but to the island-city, the new Tyre, which was, at this time, the emporium of the ancient world. The extent of her commerce will meet us in Ezekiel 27. Here, too, as in the case of the nations in Ezekiel 25, Ezekiel's indignation is roused by the exulting selfishness with which Tyre had looked on the downfall (actual or imminent, as before) of Jerusalem. \"Now,\" her rulers seem to have said, \"we shall be the only power in the land of Canaan.\" Jerusalem, that had been the gate of the peoples, was now broken. The name thus given may imply eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that Jerusalem was regarded as to a considerable extent a commercial city, carrying on much intercourse with the nations with which she was in alliance, (Ezekiel 23:40, 41; 1 Kings 9:26-28; 1 Kings 22:48; Isaiah 2:7; Herod., 3:5, of Cadytis, i.e. probably Jerusalem); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that its temple had, under Hezekiah and Josiah, drawn many proselytes from the neighboring nations, as in Psalm 87:4-6, and was looking forward to a yet fuller confluence of men of all races, as in the prophecies of Micah 4:1, 2 and Isaiah 2:2, 3 - expectations which may well have become known to a city like Tyro, in frequent intercourse with Judah. \"Now,\" the Tyrians might say, \"that hope is shattered.\" I shall be replenished. The interpolated \"now\" indicates what is, of course, implied, that Tyre expects her prosperity to increase in proportion to the decline and fall of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - As the sea causeth, etc. We note the special appropriateness of the comparison to the position of the island city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - It shall be a place for the spreading of nets, etc. The prediction is repeated in Ver. 14, and after many chances and changes, apparent revival followed by another period of decay, the present condition of Tyre strikingly corresponds with it. The travelers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries report that \"its inhabitants are only a few poor wretches that harbor in vaults and subsist upon fishing\" (Mandrell, in 1697); that the number of those inhabitants was \"only ten, Turks and Christians\" (Hasselquist, in 1751); that there were, a little later on, \"fifty or sixty poor faro nee (Volney, in 1766). During the present century there has been a partial revival, and Porter, in 1858, estimates its population at from three to four thousand. The present state of its harbor, as compared with that of Beyrout, is against any future expansion of its commerce ('Dict. Bible,' s.v. \"Tyre\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The daughters in the field are, according to the usual symbolism of prophecy, the subject or allied cities on the mainland.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will bring against thee, etc. There is a special emphasis of abruptness in the way in which Ezekiel brings in the name of the great Chaldean conqueror (we note, by the way, that he adopts the less common spelling of the name), of whom he speaks as \"king of kings.\" The title is used by Daniel (Daniel 2:37) of Nebuchadnezzar, and by Artaxerxes of himself (Ezra 7:12), by Darius in the Nakshi Rustam inscription ('Records of the Past,' 5:151), by Tiglatb-Pileser, with the addition of \"lord of lords\" (ibid., 5:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-10. - (For the usual operations of a siege, see notes on Ezekiel 4:1, 2.) The buckler was the roof of shields under which the besiegers protected themselves from the missiles of the besieged. For engines of war, read battering-rams; for wheels, wagons.

So the Vulgate, nobiles statuae. So the word is used in Isaiah 19:19; Jeremiah 43:13; 2 Kings 3:2. The words probably refer to the two famous columns standing in the temple of the Tyrian Hercules, one of gold and one of emerald (possibly malachite or lapis-lazuli), as symbols of strength, or as pedestals surmounted by a statue of Baal (Herod., 2:44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thy pleasant houses; Hebrew, houses of desire.

As in the imagery, of Isaiah 23:16, Tyre seems to have been famous for its music - the operatic city, as it were, of the ancient world - eminent no less for its culture than its commerce (romp. Ezekiel 28:13). The description of the desolation of the captured city is summed up once more in the words of Ver. 5. It shall be a place to \"spread nets upon.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Shall not the isles, etc.? The Hebrew word is used in a wider sense, as including all settlements on the sea-coast as well as islands. So it is used of Philistia (Isaiah 20:6), and of the maritime states of Asia Minor (Daniel 11:18), of the east and south coasts of Arabia (Ezekiel 27:15). Looking to the extent of commerce described in Ezekiel 27, it probably includes all the Mediterranean settlements of the Tyrians, possibly also those in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. The report of the fall of Tyre was to spread far and wide.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The princes of the sea are not the kings of the isles, but the merchant-princes of the city (Isaiah 23:8). They shall lay aside their robes of state - Tyrian purple embroidered with gold and silver - and shall put on the garments of mourners. Jonah 3:6 presents an interesting parallel. The word thrones is used, as in 1 Samuel 4:13, for any chair of state, as that of priest or judge (Proverbs 9:14; Esther 3:1), as well as for the specifically kingly throne. For the, most part, however, the later meaning is dominant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Inhabited of seafaring, etc.; Hebrew, from the seas. The sense is the same, but we lose the poetry of the original in the paraphrase. Possibly, however, the phrase may represent the position of Tyro as rising out of the sea or as deriving its wealth from it. Ewald adopts a conjectural reading, which gives \"destroyed from the seas;\" or, with another conjecture, \"She that was settled from the days of the remote past.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - It is noticeable that the commercial policy of Tyre is not represented as having been oppressive. The isles do not exult in their deliverance, but mourn over the captured city whose commerce had contributed to their prosperity. The \"terror\" of Ver. 17 is rather the impression of awe and wonder made on all who came to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - When I shall bring up the sea. The picture of desolation is completed. The sea washes over the bare rock that was once covered with the palaces of the merchant-princes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - When I shall bring thee down, etc. The pit is sheol, Hades, the unseen world of the dead. The image may have been suggested by Isaiah 14:9, where it is used of Babylon. It was obviously one on which the mind of Ezekiel dwelt, and is reproduced in Ezekiel 32:17-32. Here, apparently, the sinking in the depth of the waters (Ver. 19) is thought of as leading to that world of the dead that lay beneath them. The people of old time may possibly include the races of the old world that were submerged in the waters of the Flood. The imagery of Psalm 88:3-7 seems to have been floating before the prophet's mind. I shall set glory; better, will set. The contrast drawn is that between the shadow-world of the dead, and the earth with its living inhabitants. There Jehovah would establish his glory, would, sooner or later, manifest his kingdom, while Tyre and its pomp should be no more, belonging only to the past. Conjectural readings and renderings have been suggested as follows:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Hitzig, \"And thou no longer shinest with glory in the land of the living.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Havernick and Kliefoth, \"That I no longer produce anything glorious from thee in the land of the living.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Ewald,\" That thou mayest not remain (or stand) in the laud of the living.\" I have adopted Keil's interpretation of the Anthorized Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I will make thee a terror. Ewald translates, \"To sudden death will I bring thee,\" which corresponds with the margin of the Revised Version, I will make thee a destruction.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take up a lamentation for Tyrus. The dirge over the merchant-city that follows, the doom sic transit gloria mundi, worked out with a fullness of detail which reminds us of the Homeric catalogue of ships ('Iliad,' 2:484-770), is almost, if not altogether, without a parallel in the history of literature. It can scarcely have rested on anything but personal knowledge. Ezekiel, we must believe, had, at some time or other in his life, trod the sinful streets of the great city, and noted the mingled crowd of many nations and in many costumes that he met there, just as we infer from Dante's vivid description of the dockyards of Venice ('Inf.,' 21:7-15) that he had visited that city. Apart from its poetic or prophetic interest, it is for us almost the locus classicus as to the geography and commerce of that old world of which Tyre was in some sense the center. We may compare it, from that point of view, with the ethnological statements in Genesis 10; just as, from the standpoint of prophecy, it has to be compared with Isaiah's \"burden\" against Babylon (Isaiah 13, 14.), and with St. John's representation of Rome as the spiritual Babylon of the Apocalypse (Revelation 18.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - We begin with the picture of the city, situate at the entry (Hebrew, entries), or harbors of the sea. Of these Tyro had two - the northern, known as the Sidonian; the southern, as the Egyptian. There she dwelt, a merchant of the peoples, that came, in the wider sense of the word (see Ezekiel 26:15), from the isles of the Mediterranean. I am perfect in beauty. The boast here put into the mouth of the city appears afterwards as the utterance of its ruler, or as applied to him (Ezekiel 28:2, 15-17). We are reminded of Genoa, la superba.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In the midst of the seas; literally, in the heart (Revised Version). The words were true of the island-city, but Ezekiel has already present to his thoughts the idealized picture of the city under the figure of its stateliest ship. The builders are ship-builders, and in the verses that follow we have a picture of the Bucentaur of the Venice of the ancient world.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Fir trees of Senti. The name appears in Deuteronomy 3:9 and Song of Solomon 4:8 as Shenir; in 1 Chronicles 5:23 it is spelt as here. From Deuteronomy 3:9 we learn that it was the Amorite name for Hermon, as Sirion was the Sidonian name. In 1 Kings 5:10 Hiram King of Tyro appears as supplying Solomon with the fir and cedar timber mentioned here for the erection of his palace, the house of the forest of Lebanon (1 Kings 7:2). The fir tree was more commonly used for ships, the cedar for houses (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:444). The Hebrew for \"boards\" is unique in its form as a plural with a dual form superadded to indicate that each plank had its counterpart on the other side of the ship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The high plateau of Bashan, the region east of the sea of Galilee and the Jordan, now known as the Hauran, was famous then, as it is now, for its oak forests and its wild cattle (Psalm 22:12). The company of the Ashurites, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood. The Authorized Version follows the present Hebrew text, but the name of the nation there is not the same as that of the Assyrians, and corresponds with the Ashurites of 2 Samuel 2:9 - an obscure tribe of Canaanites, possibly identical with the Geshurites. A difference of punctuation or spelling (Bithasshurim for Bath-asshu-rim) gives the meaning which the Revised Version follows; thasshur being used in Isaiah 41:19 and Isaiah 60:13 for the box tree, or perhaps cypress, or larch, as forming part of the glory of Lebanon. The use of ivory in ship or house building seems to have been one of the arts for which Tyre was famous. So we have the ivory palace of Ahab, after he had married his Sidonian queen (1 Kings 22:39) and those of the monarch who had married a Tyrian princess in Psalm 45:8 (see also Amos 3:15). For the use of such inlaid wood in later times, see Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:137. Either the ivory or the wood is said to come from the isles of Chittim. The word was about as wide in its use as the \"Indies\" in the time of Elizabeth. Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) identifies it with Cyprus, which perhaps retains a memorial of it in Citium. The Vulgate, as in Numbers 24:24, identifies it here with Italy, and in Daniel 11:30 translates the \"ships of Chittim\" as trieres et Romani, while in 1 Macc. 1:1, it is used of Greece as including Macedonia. In Genesis 10:4 the Kittim appear as descended from Javan, i.e. are classed as Greeks or Ionians. The ivory which the Tyrians used probably came from Northern Africa, and may have been supplied through Carthage or other Phoenician colonies. A supply may have come also from Ethiopia through Egypt, or from the Red Sea ports, with which the Phoenicians carried on a trade with Arabia. Inlaid ivory-work, sometimes in wood, sometimes with enamel, is found both in Egyptian and Assyrian remains ('Dict. Bible,' s.v. \"Ivory\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For the fine linen of Egypt, the Byssus famous in its commerce, see Genesis 41:42; Exodus 26:36. This, which took the place of the coarse canvas of the common ships, was made more magnificent by being embroidered with purple or crimson, with gold borders. The ship of Antony and Cleopatra had purple sails, which, as they swelled out with the wind, served as a banner. The ancient ships had no flags or pennons. So the Revised Version renders, of fine linen, was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign. The word for \"sail\" in the Authorized Version is rendered\" banner\" in Psalm 60:4; Isaiah 13:2, and \"ensign\" in Isaiah 11:12. The isles of Elishah. The name appears in Genesis 10:4 as one of the sons of Javan. It has been identified, on the ground chiefly of similarity of sound, with Ells, Hellas, or AEolia. Laconia has been suggested as being famous for the murex which supplied the purple dye. The Targum gives Italy. Sicily also has been conjectured. The murex is common all over the Mediterranean, but Cythera and Abydos are named as having been specially famous for it. Probably, as in the case of \"Chittim,\" the word was used with considerable latitude. The latter clause of the verse describes the awning over the deck of the queenly ship. Was Ezekiel describing what he had actually seen in the state-ship of Tyro?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The two cities are named as tributaries of Tyro from which she drew her sailors, the Tyrians themselves acting as captains and pilots. Zidon (now Saida) is named in Genesis 10:15 as the firstborn of Canaan, and was older than Tyre itself (Isaiah 23:2, 12). Arvad is identified with the Greek Aradus, the modern Ruad, an island about two miles from the coast, about two miles north of the mouth of the river Eleutheros (Nahr-el-Kebir). It is scarcely a mile in circumference, but was prominent enough to be named here and in Genesis 10:18; 1 Chronicles 1:16. Opposite to it on the mainland was the town of Antaradus. For mariners, the Revised Version gives rowers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The ancients of Gebal. The word is used in the sense of \"elders\" or \"senators,\" the governing body. Gebal, for which the LXX. gives Biblii, is identified with the Greek Byblus. The name appears in Psalm 83:7 in connection, among other nations, with Tyre and Asshur, as allied with them against Israel; in Joshua 13:5 as near Lebanon and Hermon; in 1 Kings 5:18 (margin Revised Version) as among the stonemasons who worked with Hiram's builders. Byblus was situated on an eminence overlooking the river Adonis between Beirut and Tripoli. Its modern name, Gebail, retains the old Semitic form, and its ruins abound in marble and granite columns of Phoenician and Egyptian workmanship. The work of the caulkers was to stop the chinks of the ship, and the men of Gebal appear to have been especially skilful in this. We note that the metaphor of the ship falls into the background in the latter clause of the verse, and does not appear again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Persia. The name does not meet us in any Old Testament book before the exile, Elam taking its place. It was just about the time that Ezekiel wrote that the Persians were becoming conspicuous through their alliance with the Modes. So we find it again in Ezekiel 38:5; Daniel 5:28; Daniel 8:20; 2 Chronicles 36:20, 22; Ezra 1:1; Ezra 4:5; Esther 1:3. Here they are named as mercenaries in the Tyrian army. Lud. The LXX. and the Vulgate, led by the similarity of sound, give Lydians. In Genesis 10:13 the Ludim appear as descendants of Mizraim, while Lud in Genesis 10:22 is joined with Elam and Asshur as among the sons of Shem. Its combination with \"Phut\" (i.e. Libya) here and in Jeremiah 46:9 is in favor of its referring to an African nation (comp. also Ezekiel 30:5; Isaiah 66:19). Phut. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate give Libyans. In Genesis 10:6 the name is joined with Cash and Mizraim. The Lubim (Libyans) are named as forming part of Shishak's army in 2 Chronicles 12:3; 2 Chronicles 16:8, and in Nahum 3:9 and Jeremiah 46:9 as closely allied with the Egyptians. Ezekiel names Phut again as sharing in the fall of Tyre (Ezekiel 30:5), and as serving in the army of Gog (Ezekiel 38:5). Mr. R. S. Peele is inclined to identify them with the Nubians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - (For Arvad, see Ver. 8.) Gammadim. The LXX. translates \"guards\" (φύλακες); the Vulgate, Pygmies, probably as connecting the name with Gamad (equivalent to \"a cubit\"). The Targum gives \"watchmen;\" Gesenius, \"warriors:\" Hitzig, \"deserters.\" The name probably indicates that they were the flower of the Tyrian army - the life-guards (like the \"Immortals\" of the Persians) of the merchant-city. On the whole, we must leave the problem as one that we have no data for solving. The grouping with Arvad, however, suggests a Syrian or Phoenician tribe. They hanged their shields. The custom seems to have been specially Phoenician. Solomon introduced it at Jerusalem (Song of Solomon 4:4). The sight of the walls thus decorated, the shields being sometimes gilt or painted, must have been sufficiently striking to warrant Ezekiel's phrase that thus the beauty of the city was \"made perfect\" by it. The custom reappears in 1 Macc. 4:57.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Tarahish. The description of the city is followed by a catalogue raisonnee of the countries with which she traded. Here we are on more certain ground, there being a general consensus that Tarshish, the Greek Tartessus, indicates the coast of Spain, which was pre-eminent in the ancient world for the metals named (Jeremiah 10:9). The ships of Tarshish (1 Kings 22:48; Isaiah 2:16) were the larger merchant-vessels that were made for this distant traffic. Like all such names, it was probably used with considerable latitude, and it is worth noting that both the LXX. and the Vulgate give Carthaginians. Probably the chief Phoenician colonies in Spain, notably, of course, Carthago Nova, were offshoots from Carthage, in which, by the way, we trace the old Hebrew Kirjath (equivalent to \"city\"). Traded in thy fairs; better, with the Revised Version, traded for thy wares; i.e. they bartered their mineral treasures for the goods brought by the Tyrian merchants. The same Hebrew word appears in Vers. 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, but is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, and may have been a technical word in Tyrian commerce. The LXX. gives ἀγορά; the Vulgate, nundinae, which seems to have suggested the Revised Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJavan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Javan (father of Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim, and son of Japheth, Genesis 10:2, 4) stands generically for Greece, and probably represents Ionia. Tubal and Meshech are sons of Japheth in Genesis 10:2, and are always grouped together, except in Psalm 120:5, where Meshech appears alone, and in Isaiah 66:19, where Tubal is named, but not Meshech. In Ezekiel 32:26 they are associated with Elam and Asshur (Assyria); in Ezekiel 38:2, 3 and Ezekiel 39:1 with Gog. The two names probably represented the tribes on the southeast coast of the Black Sea. Here the chief traffic was in slaves, the Tyrian traders probably buying them in exchange for their manufactured goods, and selling them to the cities of Greece as well as Phoenicia. In Greek history the names appear as Tibaroni and Moschi (Herod., 3:94; Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 5:5. 2, etal.). In Joel 4:6 Tyriaus are represented as selling Israelites as slaves in Greek cities (Hebrew \"sons of Javan\"). Thrace and Scythia were at all times the chief countries from which Greece imported her slaves. Vessels of brass. Here, as throughout the Old Testament, we should read \"copper,\" the mixed metal which we know as \"brass\" not Being known to ancient metallurgy. Copper-mines were found near the Caucasus, and Euboea was also famous for them. The region was also noted for its iron.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Togarmah. The name appears in Ezekiel 38:6 as an ally of Gog, in Genesis 10:3 as a son of Gomer. Jerome identifies it with Phrygia, others with Cappadocia, but there is a wider consensus for Armenia, which was famous for its horses and mules (Xenophon, ' Anab.,' 5. 34; Strabo, 11:14. 9; Herod., 1:194).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The men of Dedan. The name occurs again in Ver. 20, and has already met us in Ezekiel 25:13 (where see note). Here the words probably refer to the many isles of the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea. So the ships of Solomon and Hiram - ships of Tarshish (name used generically for merchant-vessels) - brought ivory among their other imports, starting from Ezion-Geber (1 Kings 9:26; 1 Kings 10:22). Ebony came from Ethiopia and India. Virgil, indeed, names the latter country as the only region which produced it ('Georg.,' 2:115). Ceylon is at present one of the chief sources of supply. The LXX. curiously enough gives Rhodians, the Hebrew letters for d and r being easily mistaken by copyists.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSyria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Syria; Hebrew, Aram. The LXX. which gives ἀνθρώπους, seems to have read Adam (equivalent to \"man\"), another instance of the fact just referred to. And this has led many commentators (Michaelis, Ewald, Hitzig, Furst) to conjecture, following the Peshito Version, that Edom must have been the true reading. As regards the products named, we know too little of the commerce of Edom to say whether it included them in its exports, and the fact that the broidered work of Babylon had been famous from of old (Joshua 7:21), and that it was also the oldest emporium for precious stones, may be urged in favor of the present reading, and of taking Aram in its widest sense as including Mesopotamia. On the other hand, the mention of onyx, sapphire, coral, pearls, topaz, in Job 28:16-19, the local coloring of which is essentially Idumaean, supports the conjectural emendation. Emeralds (comp. Exodus 28:18). Some writers identify it with the carbuncle. It meets us again in Ezekiel 28:13. The fine linen (butz) is different from that of Ver. 7 (shesh) and appears only in the later books of the Old Testament (1 Chronicles 4:21; 2 Chronicles 3:14; Esther 1:6, et al.). It was probably the byssus of the Greeks, made of cotton, while the Egyptian fabric was of flax. Coral. The Hebrew (ramoth) occurs only here and in Job 28:18. \"Coral\" is the traditional Jewish interpretation, but the LXX. transliterates, and the Vulgate gives secure. Agate is found here and in Isaiah 54:12, and has been identified with the ruby or carbuncle. In Exodus 28:19 and Exodus 39:12 the English represents a different Hebrew word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Judah and the land of Israel. The narrow strip of land occupied by the Phoenicians was unable to supply its crowded population. It was dependent on Israel for its corn and oil and the like in the days of Solomon (1 Kings 5:9-11) and continued to be so to those of Herod Agrippa (Acts 12:20). Minnith appears in Judges 11:33 as a city of the Ammonites near Heshbon, and the region of Ammon was famous for its wheat (2 Chronicles 27:5). Minnith wheat probably fetched the highest price in the Tyrian markets. Pannag is found here only. The versions, Targum, LXX., give \"ointments\" (μύροι), Vulgate, balsam. Most modern commentators take it as meaning sweetmeats, the syrup of grape-juice, possibly something like the modern rahat-la-koum of Turkish commerce. Possibly, like Minnith, it may have been a proper name the significance of which is lost to us. Honey was at all times one of the famous products of Palestine (Judges 14:8; 1 Samuel 14:27; Psalm 19:10; Exodus 33:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDamascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Damascus. The chief expert of the great capital of Syria was the wine of Helbon. The name occurs only here in the Old Testament. The LXX. gives Chel-ben; the Vulgate, as if it described the quality of the wine, vinum pingue. It has been identified with Aleppo and with Chaly-ben, but both of these places are too remote from Damascus, and Mr. J. R. Porter ('Dict. Bible,' s.v.) finds it in a place a few miles from Damascus, still bearing the name, and famous as producing the finest grapes in Syria. Strabo (Ezekiel 15. p. 735) names the wine of Chalybon as the favorite drink of the Persian kings, and Athenaeus (1:22) says the same of the wine of Damascus. The name appears in Egyptian monuments in conjunction with Kedes, as a Hittite city, and Brugsch ('Geogr. AEgypt.,' 2:45) agrees with Porter as to its position. White wool. The adjective has been taken as a proper name (Smend) \"wool of Zachar,' the region being identified with Nabatheaea, which was famous for its sheep. The LXX. gives \"wool of Miletus,\" the city most famous in Greek commerce for its woollen fabrics.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Dan also; Hebrew, Vedan. The Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, takes the first syllable as the common conjunction \"and;\" but no other verse in the chapter begins in this way, and the Revised Version is probably right in giving the Hebrew word as its stands. Dan, it may be added, was hardly likely to have been singled out of all the tribes after the mention of Judah and Israel, especially as it had shared in the exile of the ten tribes. Smend identifies it with Waddan, between Mecca and Medina, or with Aden. Javan, too. already named in Ver. 13, can scarcely here be Greece, though it may possibly refer to Greek traders. It also has been identified conjecturally with an Arabian city. The words, going to and fro, have been rendered \"from Uzal\" (Genesis 10:27), the ancient name of the capital of Yemen, in Arabia; or, as in the Revised Version, with yarn. The bright iron describes the steel used for sword-blades, for which Yemen was famous. Cassia (Exodus 30:24; Psalm 45:8) and calamus (Exodus 30:23; Song of Solomon 4:14) both belong to the class of perfumes for which Arabia was famous. It is probably the Acorns fragraas, the \"sweet cane\" of Isaiah 43:24; Jeremiah 6:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Dedan (see Ver. 15). Here probably we have another portion of the same race. The precious clothes for riding (Revised Version) were probably of the nature of the carpets used then as now as saddle-cloths - the ephippia of the Greeks - in Persia and other parts of Asia. Compare \"ye that sit on rich carpels,\" in Judges 5:10 (Revised Version). So the Vulgate, tapetibus ad sedendum. The LXX. gives κτήνη ἔκλετα, as though it referred to horses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Arabia. The word, commonly in connection with Dedan, is used in the limited sense which attaches to it in the Old Testament (2 Chronicles 9:14; Isaiah 21:13; Jeremiah 25:24)for the tribes of what in Greek and Roman geography were known as Arabia Deserts. Kedar. The name (equivalent to \"black-skinned\") appears as that of the second son of Ishmael (Genesis 25:13). The black tents of Kedar (Psalm 120:5; Song of Solomon 1:5) indicate a nomadic tribe of the Bedouin type, famous, as in Isaiah 60:7 and Jeremiah 49:28, 29, for their flocks of sheep and camels. They appear, also, as having cities and villages in Isaiah 42:11. The name is used in later rabbinic writings for all the inhabitants of Arabia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Sheba. The Sabaea of the Greeks. It is applied, in Genesis 10:7 and 1 Chronicles 1:9, to a grandson of Cush; in Genesis 10:28 and 1 Chronicles 1:22, to a son of Joktan; and in Genesis 25:3 and 1 Chronicles 1:32, to a grandson of Abraham. Geographically, in Ezekiel's time it probably included the South-Arabian region, that of Yemen, or Arabia Felix, and was famous, as in the history of the Queen of Sheba, for its gold, gems, and spices (1 Kings 10:1, 2; Psalm 72:10, 15). Raamah. Named in Genesis 10:7 as father of the Cushite Sheba, and probably, therefore, connected with it ethnologically and geographically. The chief of all spices had probably a technical name, like the \"principal spices\" of Exodus 30:23 and Song of Solomon 4:14 for the genuine balsam, the product of the Amyris opobalsamum, which is found between Mecca and Medina. The precious stones includes onyx, rubies, agates, and cornelians found in the mountains of Hadramant, and the jaspers and crystals of Yemen. In the Rhammanitae, mentioned by Strabo as a Sabaean tribe (16:782), we have, perhaps, a survival of the old name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Haran and Canaeh, etc. From Arabia we pass to Mesopotamia. Haran (Genesis 11:31) stands for the Carrhae of the Romans, situated at the point where the old military and commercial roads bifurcated Cowards Babylon and the Delta of the Persian Gulf in the one direction, and Canaan in the other. It appears in Genesis 24:10 and Genesis 29:4 as the city of Nahor, in Mesopotamia (Aram-Naharaim, equivalent to \"Syria of the two rivers\"), or, more definitely, in Parian-Atom, which lies below Mount Masius, between the Khabour and the Euphrates. It is famous in Roman history for the defeat of Crassus by the Parthians. Caaneh. The eastern of the two roads just mentioned ran on to Calneh (of which Cauneh is a variant), named in Genesis 10:10 as one of the cities built by Nimrod. It is probably represented by the modern Niffer, about sixty miles southeast of Babylon. It is named in Isaiah 10:9 in connection with Carehemish, in Amos 6:2 with Hamath the great, as conquered by the Assyrians. It has been conjecturally identified by the Targum and other ancient writers with Ctesiphon, but (?). Eden; spelt differently in the Hebrew from the Eden of Genesis 2:8. It is probably identical with the Eden near Thelassar (Td. Assar) of Isaiah 37:12 and 2 Kings 19:12, where, as here, it is connected with Haran as among the Assyrian conquests. Its site has not been determined, and it has been placed by some geographers in the hill-country above the Upper Mesopetamian plains; by others near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. The position of the Eden of Amos 1:5, near Damascus, points to a Syrian town of the same name. The merchants of Sheba. The recurrence of the name after the full mention of the people in Ver. 22 arises probably from the fact that they were the carriers in the commerce between the Mesopotamian cities just named and Tyre. Asshur. The name may stand (Smend), as it commonly does, for Assyria as a country; but its juxtaposition with the names of cities has led some geographers (Movers, p. 252, in Keil) to identify with a city Sum (Essurieh) on the west bank of the Euphrates, above Thapsacus (the Tiphsah of 1 Kings 4:24), and on the caravan-route which runs from Palmyra (the Tadmor of 2 Chronicles 8:4) to Haran. Chilmad. The name is not found elsewhere. The LXX. gives Charman, a town near the Euphrates, mentioned in Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 1:5. 10, as Charmaude. It can scarcely have been a place of much general note, but may have had some special reputation which made it prominent in Tyrian commerce.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were thy merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - In all sorts of things; better, with the Revised Version, in choice wares. Hebrew, articles of beauty; or, as in margin of the Authorized Version, \"excellent things.\" The words have been variously interpreted,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) by Ewald, as \"suits of armor;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) by Keil, as \"stately dresses;\"NEWLINENEWLINEby Havernick, as \"works of art\" generally. The description in detail that follows is so vivid as to give the impression that Ezekiel had seen the merchants of Sheba unloading their camels and bringing out their treasures as they arrived at Tyro. The blue clothes (wrappings of blue, as in the Revised Version) were the purple robes of Babylon, which were famous all over the world. The words that follow are somewhat obscure, but are probably rightly translated by Keil, \"embroidered of twisted yarn, in-wound, and strong cords for thy wares.\" The yarn may have been used for the cordage of the Tyrian ships. The words, made of cedar, are in this rendering taken as an adjective, equivalent to \"firm\" or \"strong\" (so Furst).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The verse beaus a new section, and glides back into the original metaphor of the ship, as in Vers. 4-9. The ships of Tarshish are used generically for merchant-ships. The catalogue of the commerce ends with Ver. 24, and the more poetic imagery reappears. It was, as centering in herself all that they brought to her that the merchant-city was very glorious in the midst of the waters. For sing of thee, read, the ships of Tarshish were thy caravans (Revised Version). The word has also the sense of \"wall,\" as in Jeremiah 5:10 and Job 24:11; and this, describing the ships as the \"wooden wails\" of Tyre, gives a tenable sense here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Thy rowers have brought thee. The metaphor goes on its course. The state-ship is in the open sea, and the east wind, the Euroclydon of the Mediterranean (Acts 27:14), blows and threatens it with destruction (comp. Psalm 48:7). In that destruction all who contributed to her prosperity were involved. The picture reminds us of the description of the ship of Tarshish in Jonah 1:4, 5. The city shall be left, in that terrible day, in the heart of the seas (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The suburbs. The word is so translated in Ezekiel 45:2, and Ezekiel 48:17, and is used of the pasture-lands round the cities of refuge in Numbers 35:2. Here it is probably used in a wider sense for the coast-lands of Phoenicia, or even (as in the margin) for the \"waves\" that washed the shores of the island-city. The Vulgate gives classes (equivalent to \"fleets\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-31. - And all that handle the oar, etc. The picture is, perhaps, figurative. As Tyre itself was the great state-ship, so the other ships may stand for the other Phoenician cities that beheld her downfall. Looking to the picture itself, it presents the rowers and others as feeling that, if the great ship had been wrecked, there was little hope of safety for them, and so they leave their ships and stand on the coast wailing. (For casting dust, as a sign of mourning, see Joshua 7:6; 1 Samuel 4:12; Job 2:12, et al.; for \"wallowing in the dust,\" Jeremiah 6:26; Jeremiah 25:34; Micah 1:10-16. For the \"baldness\" and \"sackcloth\" of Ver. 31, see Ezekiel 7:18.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - As in other instances of extreme sorrow, the inarticulate signs of grief pass after a time into spoken words. What city is like Tyrus, etc.? What parallel can be found in the world's history, either for her magnificence or her fall? The shipwreck of her fortunes (we are still in the region of the prophet's metaphors) would be utter and irretrievable.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel27:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - From the city the prophet passes to its ruler, who concentrated in himself whatever was most arrogant and boastful in the temper of his people. He is described here as a\" prince,\" in Ver. 12 as \"king,\" and the combination of the two words points probably to some peculiarity of the Tyrian constitution. \"Prince\" it will be remembered, is constantly used by Ezekiel of Zedekiah (Ezekiel 7:27; Ezekiel 12:20, el al.). The King of Tyro at the time was Ithobal or Ethbaal III. (Josephus, 'Contra Apion,' 1:21), who had taken part with Pharaoh-Hophra and Zedekiah in the league against Nebuchadnezzar, Ezekiel's description of what one may call his self-apotheosis may probably have rested on a personal knowledge of the man or of official documents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I am a God. We are reminded of Isaiah's words (Isaiah 14:13, 14) as to the King of Babylon. Did Ezekiel emphasize and amplify the boasts of Ethbaal, with a side-glance at the Chaldean king, who also was lifted up in the pride of his heart (Daniel 4:30)? For like examples, see the boast of Hophra, in Ezekiel 29:3; and the praise given to Herod Agrippa by the Tyrians (Acts 12:21). It is noticeable that St. Paul's description of the man of sin (2 Thessalonians 2:4) presents the same picture in nearly the same words. I sit in the seat of God, etc. Tyro was known as the Holy Island (Sanchon., edit. Orelli, p. 36). The city was thought of as rising from its waters like the rock-throne of God. Though thou set thy heart. The words remind us of the temptation in Genesis 3:5. To forget the limitations of human ignorance and weakness, to claim an authority and demand a homage which belong to God, was the sin of the Prince of Tyre, as it had been that of Sennacherib, as it was of Nebuchadnezzar, as it has been since of the emperors of Rome, and of other rulers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou art wiser than Daniel, etc. There is, of course, a marked irony in the words. Daniel was for Ezekiel - and there seems something singularly humble and pathetic in the prophet's reverence for his contemporary - the ideal at once of righteousness (Ezekiel 14:14) and of wisdom. He was a revealer of the secrets of the future, and read the hearts of men. His fame was spread far and wide through the Chaldean empire. And this was the man with whom the King of Tyro compared himself with a self-satisfied sense of superiority, and he found the proof of his higher wisdom in his wealth. Here, again, I venture to trace a side-thrust at Nebuchadnezzar and his tendencies in the same direction,\" Is not this great Babylon, which I have builded?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will bring strangers, etc. These are, of course, the hosts of many nations that made up the Chaldean army (comp. the parallel of Ezekiel 30:11 and Ezekiel 31:12). The beauty of thy wisdom is that of the city on which the prince looked as having been produced by his policy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The effect of the Chaldean invasion was to bring the king down to the nether world of the dead. In the use of the plural \"deaths\" we have a parallel to the \"plurima morris imago\" of Virgil ('AEneid,' 2:369). And this death was not to be like that of a hero-warrior, but as that of those who are slain in the midst of the seas, who fall, i.e., in a naval battle, and are cast into the waters. Would he then repeat his boast, I am God?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The climax comes in the strongest language of Hebrew scorn. As the uncircumcised were to the Israelite (1 Samuel 17:36; 1 Samuel 31:4), so should the King of Tyro, unhonored, unwept, with no outward marks of reverence, be among the great cues of the past who dwell in Hades. Ezekiel returns to the phrase in Ezekiel 31:18; Ezekiel 32:24. The words receive a special force from the fact that the Phoenicians practiced circumcision before their intercourse with the Greeks (Herod., 2:104).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou sealest up the sum, etc. The noun is found only there and in Ezekiel 43:10, where it is translated \"pattern,\" but is cognate with the word rendered\" tale\" (equivalent to \"measure\") of Exodus 5:13, and \"measure\" in Ezekiel 45:11. The probable meaning is, Thou settest the seal to thy completeness (perfection). Thou deemest that thou hast attained the consummation of all beauty and wisdom. The LXX. and the Vulgate give, \"Thou art a seal;\" and this suggests a parallelism with Jeremiah's works to Coniah (Jeremiah 22:24). The words were, of course, written with a keen irony. This was what the King of Tyro thought of himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou hast been in Eden, etc. The words are suggestive, as showing that Ezekiel was familiar with the history of Genesis 2. and 3. (compare the mention of Noah, in Ezekiel 15:14, 20). To him the King of Tyre seemed to claim a position like that of Adam before his fall, perfect in beauty and in wisdom, the lord of the creation. And in that fancied Eden he stood, so he thought, not like Adam, \"naked and ashamed,\" but like one of the cherubim that guarded the gates of the primeval Paradise (Genesis 3:24), covered with all imaginable splendor. Ezekiel returns to the phrase in Ezekiel 31:8, 16, 18 and Ezekiel 36:35. Other instances meet us in Joel 2:3 and Isaiah 51:3. Every precious stone. All the stones named are found in the list of the gems on the high priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:17-20; Exodus 39:8-14). Three, however, of those gems are wanting - those in the third row of the breastplate - which are not named elsewhere; and the order is not the same. The LXX. makes the two lists identical, apparently correcting Ezekiel by Exodus. St. John (Revelation 21:19) reproduces his imagery in his vision of the foundation stones of the New Jerusalem, but naturally returns to the fullness of the symbolic number - twelve. Possibly the description of gold and bdellium and onyx (or beryl), as in Genesis 2:11, 12, may have suggested the thought that Eden was a land of jewels. The workmanship of thy tabret and pipes; better, the service. The Authorized Version and Revised Version follow Luther. Keil agrees as to \"tabret\" (so Genesis 31:27; Isaiah 5:12; elsewhere, as in Exodus 15:20 and Job 21:12, the Authorized Version gives \"timbrels\"), but takes the latter word (not found elsewhere) as identical with its feminine form, and meaning \"female.\" He sees in the clause, accordingly, a picture of the pomp of the Tyrian king, surrounded by the odalisques of the harem, who, with their timbrels, danced to his honor as their lord and king (camp. Isaiah 23:16; Exodus 15:20; 1 Samuel 18:6). Havernick, who agrees with Keil, calls attention to a passage in Athenaeus (12:8. p. 531), in which Strafe, a Sidonian king, is said to have prepared for a great festival by bringing girls who played on the flute and harp from all parts of Greece. Others, however (Smend), find in both the words articles of jewelry, pearls perforated or set in gold (as in Exodus 28:20), and so see in them the conclusion of the description of the gorgeous apparel of the king. Furst takes the words as meaning musical instruments that were of gold set with jewels. Ewald, following out the Urim and Thummim idea, takes the gems as the subject of the sentence, and translates, \"they were for the work of thine oracles and divining.\" On the whole, the interpretation given above seems preferable. In the day that thou wast created. The words point to the time of the king's enthronement or coronation. It was then that he appeared in all his supreme magnificence. Had Ezekiel been a witness of that ceremony?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The anointed cherub that covereth. The word for \"anointed\" is not found elsewhere, but is cognate in form with that which is commonly so rendered. The Vulgate, however, tracing it to another root, gives extentus et protegens, and is followed by Luther, Gesenius, Ewald, and others. Keil and Hengstenberg accept \"anointed.\" The sequence of thought seems to be as follows: The splendor-of the King of Tyre had suggested the idea of Eden the garden of God. This, in its turn, led on to that of the cherub that was the warder of that garden (Genesis 3:24). The Paradise of God is pictured as still existing, and the cherub - we remember how prominent the word and the thing had been in Ezekiel's thoughts (Ezekiel 1:10; Ezekiel 10:1-16) - is there (according as we take the above words) either as its anointed, i.e. \"consecrated,\" ruler, or as extending the protection of its overshadowing wings far and wide as the cherubim of the tabernacle extended their wings over the ark (comp. Exodus 25:20; Exodus 33:22; 1 Kings 8:7). Those cherubim, we may remember, were actually anointed (Exodus 30:26). The King of Tyro boasted that he was, like them, consecrated to his office as king \"by the grace of God.\" In that earthly Paradise the prophet saw the \"holy mountain of God,\" the Olympus, so to speak, of the Hebrews, the throne of the Eternal (compare the Meru of India, the Albard of Iran, the Asgard of German poetry). Isaiah's words as to the King of Babylon (Isaiah 14:13, 14) present a suggestive parallel. In the midst of the stones of fire. The words receive their interpretation partly from Genesis 3:24; partly from 2 Samuel 22:9, 15; Psalm 18:8, 12; Psalm 120:4. The cherub's sword of fire is identified with the lightning-flash, and that in its turn with the thunderbolts of God. Out of the throne of God went thunders and lightnings (Exodus 19:16). The \"Flammantia maenia mundi\" of Lucretius (1. 73) offers a suggestive parallel. The King of Tyre, like the King of Babylon (Isaiah 14:13, 14), is painted as exulting in that attribute of the Divine glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou wast perfect in thy ways. The glory of the King of Tyre was, the prophet goes on to say, conditional. He began his reign in righteousness, but afterwards iniquity was found in him. And the root of that iniquity was the pride of wealth engendered by the greatness of his commerce (Ver. 16). He was no longer like the cherub who guarded the Paradise of God, but like Adam when he was east out from it. Wealth and pride had tempted him to violence and to wrong, and he was no longer an \"anointed\" or consecrated, but a profaned and desecrated, king. The, \"stones of fire,\" the thunders and lightnings of the Divine Majesty, should no longer protect him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thine heart was lifted up, etc. In yet another point Ezekiel sees the fall of Adam reproduced in that of the Tyrian king. He had forfeited his beauty and his wisdom through the pride which sought for a yet greater glory by a false and counterfeit wisdom (Genesis 3:6). I will cast thee, etc. The words are better taken, as in the Revised Version, in the past tense, I have cast thee... I have laid thee before kings. Pride was to have its fall, as in Isaiah 23:9. The very sanctuaries, the temples which made Tyre the \"holy island,\" were defiled by the iniquities through which the wealth that adorned them had been gained. The \"fire,\" instead of being a rampart of protection, should burst forth as from the center of the sanctuary to destroy him. Is there an implied allusion to the fiery judgment that fell on Nadab and Abihu (Leviticus 10:2) and on Korah and his company (Numbers 16:35)? The doom of Sic transit gloria mundi was already passed on her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thou shalt be a terror, etc. The knell of doom, as heard in Ezekiel 27:36, rings out again. The same judgment falls alike on the city and on its king. The question when and in what manner the prediction received its fulfillment has been much discussed. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10:11. 1; 'Contra Apion,' 1:19) states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged the island Tyre and Ithobal (Ethbaal III.) for thirteen years; that, on his father's death, leaving his Phoenician and other captives to be brought by slower stages, he himself hastened to Babylon, and that afterwards he conquered the whole of Syria and Phoenicia; but he does not say, with all the Tyrian records before him, that the city was actually captured by him. It has been inferred, indeed, from Ezekiel 29:18, that Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre ended in, at least, partial failure, that he and his army had no \"wages\" for their work, i.e. that the spoil of the city was meager and disappointing. Possibly the merchant-princes of the city had contrived to carry off part of their treasures in their ships. On the other hand, it may be notedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the national historians of the ancient world (perhaps not of that only) willingly minimized the disasters of their country; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the Phoenician fragment quoted by Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:21) simply for synchronistic purposes, shows a significant change of government following on the siege. Ithobal was \"king\" during the thirteen years, but afterwards \"judges\" were appointed, and these ruled for periods of two, or three, or ten months. All this indicates a period of confusion and anarchy, the consequence of some great catastrophe. As a whole, too, we have to remember that it was with Tyre, as with Babylon and with other nations. The prophecies against them had \"springing and germinant accomplishments.\" What the prophet saw in vision, as wrought out in a moment of time, was actually the outcome of the slow decay of centuries, and of catastrophes separated from each other by long intervals of a dwindling history. The main facts of that history may be briefly stated. There was, as implied in Isaiah 23:17, a revival of commerce under the Persian monarchy, and of this we have traces in Nehemiah 13:16. Two hundred and fifty years after Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre was still so strongly fortified that Alexander the Great did not take it till after a seven years' siege (Died. Sic., 17:20; Arrian., 2:17; Q. Curtius, 4:2-4). It rose again into wealth and power under the Selencidare, and the Romans made it the capital of their province of Phoenicia. It appears as a flourishing town in Matthew 15:21; Acts 12:20; Acts 21:37, and is described by Strabo (16:2, 23), as having two harbors and lofty houses. From A.D. to 1125 it was in the hands of the Saracens. Saladin attacked it without success in A.D. . In A.D. , after Acre had been taken by storm by El-Ashraf, Sultan of Egypt, Tyro passed into his hands without a struggle. When it again passed into the power of the Saracens, its fortifications were demolished, and from that time it sank gradually into its present obscurity. The present Sur is a small town of narrow, crooked, and dirty streets, and the ruins of the old Phoenician city cover the suburbs to the extent of half a league round. The harbor is choked up with sand, and with remains of the old palaces and walls and temples, and is available for small boats only. The sea has swallowed up its grandeur. The soft on which the traveler stands is a mass of debris, in which marble, porphyry, and granite mingle with coarser stones. So it has come to pass that it is little more than \"a place for the spreading of nets\" and that the sentence, \"Thou shalt never be any more,\" seems to be receiving its fulfillment. There was for it no prospect of an earthly restoration, still less that of a transfigured and glorified existence like that which, in the prophet's visions, was connected with Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Set thy face against Zidon. The relation of this city to Tyre was one of sufficient independence to justify a separate oracle for the completeness of the prophet's arrangement of his messages (Ezekiel 27:8; Joel 3:4; Jeremiah 25:22; Zechariah 9:2). It was sufficiently identified with it not to call for any long description. It is assumed that her sins were of the same kind and required a like punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I will be glorified in... thee. The thought and the phrase come from Exodus 14:4; Leviticus 10:3. Ezekiel reproduces it in Ezekiel 39:13. God is glorified, or, as in the next clause, sanctified, when his power and holiness are manifested in righteous judgment. (For \"sanctified,\" see Ezekiel 38:16: Numbers 20:13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her streets; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Pestilence was the natural accompaniment of a siege. As in Ezekiel 14:19, blood probably points to death from this cause, as distinct from the slaughter threatened in the following clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - There shall be no more a pricking brier. There is a special appropriateness in Ezekiel's imagery. The words had been used in Numbers 33:55 of the Canaanites at large (comp. Joshua 22:13). Ezekiel applies them to the cities which were the most conspicuous survivors of the old Canaanite races. Israel, he implies, had been wounded with those thorns and briers, had caught (as e.g., in the case of Jezebel) the taint of evil life and evil worship from those races; but for her there is, as in Ver. 25, the future of restoration, and when that future comes, the Canaanite cities, with their idolatries and vices, should have passed away forever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - My servant Jacob. The use of \"Jacob\" for \"Israel\" is not common in Ezekiel, but Ezekiel 20:5; Ezekiel 27:25; Ezekiel 34:25 may be noted as parallels.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Shall build houses, etc. The words sound almost like a direct quotation from Jeremiah 23:6 and Jeremiah 36:28; and, at all events, present a suggestive parallel. The restoration was to include also the blessing of confidence and hope; no longer a groundless and false confidence, like that of Jeremiah 2:37 and Jeremiah 48:13, but one resting on the fact that God was in very deed the Judge of all the earth. We may note, at the close of the chapter, how its juxtaposition of the two Phoenician cities seems to have been present to the mind of the Christ in his references to the judgment that should come upon both of them (Matthew 11:21; Luke 10:13). He himself, it will be remembered, passed through the coasts of Tyre and Zidon (Matthew 15:21), and probably, according to the best text of Mark 7:24, actually trod the streets of the latter city. They supplied some of the great multitude of Mark 3:8, who listened to his teaching.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the tenth year, etc. The precision with which the dates of the several portions of the prophecy against Egypt are given, here and in Ver. 17; Ezekiel 30:20; Ezekiel 31:1; Ezekiel 32:1, 7, shows that each was called forth by the political events of the time, and has to be studied in connection with them. It will be well, therefore, to begin with a Brief survey of the relations which existed at this period between Judah, Egypt, and Babylon. After the great defeat of Pharaoh-Necho by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish ( B.C. 604), on which Jeremiah (46.) dwells fully, he was succeeded in B.C. 594 by his son Psammetik II. the Psammis of Herodotus 2:160, who invaded Ethiopia, and died in B.C. 588, leaving the throne to his son Uah-prahet, the Pharaoh Hophra of Jeremiah 44:30, the Apries of Herod., 2:161. The Greek historian tells us that he attacked Tyre and Zidon, failed in an enterprise against Cyrene, and was deposed by Amasis ( B.C. 569). Zedekiah and his counselors, following in the steps of Hezekiah (Isaiah 30.) and Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 46.), had courted his alliance against the Chaldeans. As Ezekiel had prophesied (Ezekiel 17:11-18), they found that they were once more leaning on a broken reed. We have now come to B.C. 589, when Jerusalem was actually besieged, but was still dreaming of being relieved by an Egyptian army.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The great dragon. The word is cognate with that used in Genesis 1:21 for the great \"whales,\" monsters of the deep. The \"dragon,\" probably the crocodile of the Nile (compare the description of \"leviathan\" in Job 41.) had come to be the received prophetic symbol of Egypt (Psalm 74:13; Isaiah 27:1; Isaiah 51:9). The rivers are the Nile-branches of the Delta. My river is mine own. The words probably imply that Hophra, like his grandfather Necho, in his plan of a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, had given much time and labor to irrigation works in Lower Egypt. The boast which rose to his lips reminds us of that of Nebuchadnezzar as he looked on Babylon (Daniel 4:30). He, like the kings of Tyre and Babylon, was tempted to a self-apotheosis, and thought of himself as the Creator of his own power. The words of Herodotus (2. 169), in which he says that Apries believed himself so firmly established in his kingdom that there was no god that could cast him out of it, present a suggestive parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - I will put hooks in thy jaws. So Herodotus (2. 70) describes the way in which the Egyptians caught the crocodile by baiting a large hook with swine's flesh. Jomard ('Description de l'Egypt,' 1:27) gives a similar account (comp. also Job 41:1, 2, though there the capture seems represented as an almost impossible achievement; probably the process had become more familiar since the date of that book). The fish that stick to the scales of the crocodile are, of course, in the interpretation of the parable, either the Egyptian army itself or the nations that had thrown themselves into alliance with Egypt, and the destruction of the two together in the wilderness points to some great overthrow of the Egyptian army and its auxiliaries, probably to that of the expedition against Cyrene (Herod., 2:161) which led to the revolt of Amasis, and which would take the wilderness west of the Nile on its line of march. The beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven (we note the recurrence of the old Homeric phrase, as in 'Iliad,' 1:4, 5) should devour the carcasses of the slain, the corpses of the fallen and prostrate nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A staff of reed unto the house of Israel. Ezekiel reproduces the familiar image of 2 Kings 18:21; Isaiah 36:6. The proverb had not ceased to be true, though the rulers were different. Here, again, the imagery is strictly local. The reeds were as characteristic of the Nile as the crocodiles (Exodus 1:3; Job 40:21). The image of the reed is continued in Ver. 7, and the effect of trusting to its support is described in detail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee. The words are probably addressed to the nation personified rather than to the king. The sentence of doom is now pronounced, no longer figuratively. And the special guilt for which it was inflicted, a guilt which the nation shared with its ruler, is emphatically repeated in Ver. 9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - From the tower of Syene, etc. The Authorized Version is misleading, as Syene was itself on the border of Ethiopia. Better, with the Revised Version margin, from Migdol to Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia. The Migdol (equivalent to \"tower\") so named is mentioned in the 'Itinerarium' of Antoninus (p. 171, edit. Wafael), and was about twelve miles from Pelusium, and thus represented the northern extremity of Egypt; as Syene, identified with the modern Assouan, represented the southern, being the last fortified town in Egypt proper. The expedition of Psammis against Ethiopia, as above, had probably given prominence to the latter fortress. So taken, the phrase corresponded to the familiar \"from Dan to Beersheba\" of Judges 20:1, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Neither shall it be inhabited forty years. It need hardly be said that history reveals no such period of devastation. Nor, indeed, would anything but the most prosaic literalism justify us in looking for it. We are dealing with the language of a poet-prophet, which is naturally that of hyperbole, and so the \"forty years\" stand, as, perhaps, elsewhere (Judges 3:11; Judges 5:31, etc.), for a period of undefined duration, and the picture of a land on which no man or beast sets foot for that of a time of desolation, and consequent cessation of all the customary traffic along the Nile. Such a period, there is reason to believe, did follow on the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar. It is implied in Vers. 17-21, which carry us to a date seventeen years later than that of the verse with which we are now dealing; and also in Jeremiah 43:10-12. Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:20) speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as having invaded Libya. The reign of Amasis, which followed on the deposition of Hophra, was one of general prosperity as regards commerce and culture, but Egypt ceased to be one of the great world-powers after the time of Nebuchadnezzar and fell easily into the hands of the Persians under Cambyses. It is noticeable that Ezekiel does not, like Isaiah (Isaiah 19:18-25), connect the future of Egypt with any Messianic expectations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations. As before, records are silent as to any such dispersion. All that we can say is that such a deportation was uniformly the sequel of the conquests of an Oriental king, as in the case of the captivities of Samaria (2 Kings 17:6) and Jerusalem, and of the nations that were settled in Samaria (2 Kings 17:6), and of the Persians by Darius; that if we find reason to believe that Egypt was invaded by Nebuchadnezzar after the destruction of Jerusalem, we may assume, with little risk of doubt, that it was followed by what Ezekiel describes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - At the end of forty years. The restoration described may probably be connected with the policy of the Persian kings. There may have been a parallel, as regards Egypt, to the return of the Jewish exiles under Cyrus and his successors, though it has not left its mark on history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Into the land of Pathros. (For the land of their habitation, read, with the Revised Version, the land of their birth.) (For Pathres, see Genesis 10:13, 14; 1 Chronicles 1:12; Isaiah 11:1; Jeremiah 44:1.) Its position is somewhat doubtful, but the balance of evidence is in favor of placing it in the Thebaid of Upper Egypt, which Herodotus (2. 4, 15) describes as the original seat of the Egyptian monarchy. Its name may be connected with the Pathyrite name in which Thebes was situated (Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 5:9). The LXX. gives the form Pathures, and is followed by the Vulgate, with a slight change, Phathures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - It shall be the basest of the kingdoms. The words describe vividly the condition of Egypt under the Persian monarchy, after its conquest by Cambyses. With the Ptolemies it rose again to something like eminence, but that, it must be remembered, was an alien dynasty. The nationality of Egypt was suppressed, and Alexandria, practically a Greek city, took the place of Memphis, Sais, and Thebes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel. Throughout the history of the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as in the case of Hoshea (2 Kings 17:4), Hezekiah (Isaiah 30:2, 3; Isaiah 36:4, 6), and Jehoiakim (2 Kings 23:35), their temptation had been to place its \"confidence\" in the \"chariots and horses\" of Egypt as an ally. That temptation should not recur again. Egypt should not in that way bring the iniquity of Israel to the remembrance of the Judge, acting, as it were, as a Satan, first tempting and then accusing. There should be no more looking after Egypt instead of Jehovah, as their succor and defense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In the seven and twentieth, etc. The section that follows has the interest of being, as far as the dates recorded enable us to determine, the latest of Ezekiel's prophecies, and brings us to B.C. 572. It was manifestly inserted at a later date, seventeen years after those which precede and follow it, either by the prophet, as he collected and revised his writings, or by some later editor, as a proof that his earlier predictions had already received, or were on the point of receiving, their fulfillment. The fact that the special word of the Lord came on the first day of the year is not without significance. Then, as now, the beginning of a new year was a time for men generally to look before and after, for a prophet to ask himself what new stage in the order of the Divine government the year was likely to produce.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Nebuchadnezzar, etc. The words carry us to the close of the thirteen years' siege of Tyre referred to in the notes on Ezekiel 28, and enable us to refer the commencement of that siege to the fourteenth year of Jehoiachin's captivity, circ. B.C. 586, two years after the destruction of Jerusalem. This agrees with the report of the Tyrian Annals given by Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:21), who gives the names of the kings of Tyro from Ithobal to Hirom, in the fourteenth year of whose reign Cyrus became King of Persia. Josephus, however, gives the seventh, in. stead of the seventeenth, year of Nebuchadnezzar as the date of the beginning of the siege. Here the point dwelt on is not the success of the siege, but its comparative failure. The labors and sufferings of the besiegers had been immense. Jerome (in loc.) states (not, however, giving his authority) that these labors consisted mainly in the attempt to fill up the strait between the island-city and the mainland with masses of stone and rubbish. These were carried on the heads and shoulders of the troops, and the natural result was that the former lost their hair and the latter their skin, and the whole army was in a miserable plight. And after all, the king had no wages for his labors. The city indeed, was taken, but the inhabitants made their escape by sea, with their chief possessions, and the hopes of spoil were disappointed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Behold I give the land of Egypt, etc. For this disappointment, Ezekiel, writing, so to speak, the postscript which he incorporates with his earlier oracles, promises compensation. Egypt, as he had said seventeen years before, should be conquered, and its cities plundered, and so there should be wages enough for the whole thirteen years of fruitless labor in the siege of Tyre. In that labor, the prophet adds (Ver. 20), they, though they knew it not, had been working out the will of the Supreme. They also had been servants of Jehovah, as Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:9) had described Nebuchadnezzar himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The horn of the house of Israel. The \"horn\" is, as always (1 Samuel 2:1; Psalm 92:10; Psalm 112:9; Psalm 132:17), the symbol of power. Jeremiah's use of it (Lamentations 2:3) may well have been present to Ezekiel's thoughts. That horn had been cut off, but it should begin to sprout again, and the prophet himself should resume his work as the teacher of his people, which had apparently been suspended for many years after the closing vision of the restoration of the temple and of Israel. The words justify the conclusion that Ezekiel resumed his labors after B.C. 572. Was he watching the growth of Saiathiel or Zerubbabel?NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Son of man, etc. It is noticeable that the phrase (ben adam), as addressed to a prophet, occurs only in Ezekiel, in whom we find it not less than eighty times, and in Daniel 8:17. As used elsewhere, e.g. in Numbers 23:19; Psalm 8:4; Job 25:6; Isaiah 51:12; Isaiah 56:2, and in Ezekiel's use of it, it is probably connected with the history of Adam, as created from the ground (adamah) in Genesis 2:7; Genesis 3:19. The prophet is reminded, in the very moment of his highest inspiration, of his Adam nature with all its infirmity and limitations. In the use of a like phrase (bar enosh, instead of ben adam) in Daniel 7:13 we have the same truth implied. There one like unto man in all things is called to share the sovereignty of the \"Ancient of Days,\" the Eternal One. Here the prophet, nothing in himself, is called to be the messenger of God to other sons of men. It is in many ways suggestive that our Lord should have chosen the same formula for constant use when speaking of himself (Matthew 8:20, and passim in the Gospels). Stand upon thy feet. The attitude of adoration is changed, by the Divine command, into that of expectant service, that of awe and dread for the courage of a soldier of the Lord of hosts (compare the parallels of Ezekiel 3:24; Ezekiel 43:3, 5; Daniel 8:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the Spirit, etc. It scarcely admits of question (though the Hebrew has no article, and so far Luther's Version, \"Ich ward wieder erquickt,\" is tenable) that the word is used in the same sense as in Ezekiel 1:20, 21 (comp. Ezekiel 3:24). The Spirit which moved the \"living creatures\" and the \"wheels\" in the mysterious symbol was now in him. Ezekiel finds in that fact the ground of his prophetic inspiration (comp. Numbers 24:2; Judges 11:29; 1 Samuel 10:6, 10; Isaiah 11:2, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To a rebellious nation; literally, with Revised Version, nations that are rebellious. The Hebrew word (goim) is that used elsewhere for \"heathen\" and that may be its sense here. As in Ezekiel 28:22. Judah and Israel may be thought of as having fallen to the level of the heathen. Part of Ezekiel's work was actually addressed to the heathen as such (ch. 25-32.). The word may, however, be used in the plural to include both Judah and the remnant of the northern kingdom. They and their fathers. The words anticipate the teaching of ch. 18. The people to whom the prophet was sent could not say that they were suffering for the sins of their fathers. They, in their own persons, had transgressed up to the very day on which the prophet received his mission. They had rebelled as their fathers had done in the days of Moses and Joshua (Numbers 14:9; Joshua 22:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Impudent children and stiff-hearted; literally, hard of face (i.e. callous to their shame) and stiff of heart. The LXX. gives aptly, σκληροπρόσωποι καὶ σκληροκάρδιοι (compare the \"past feeling\" of Ephesians 4:19). Thus saith the Lord God. In the Hebrew, Adoaai Jehovah; which the LXX. represents by Κύριος Κύριος, and Luther by \"der Herr Herr.\" The two highest names of the God of Israel were 'used to denote the fulness of the prophet's inspiration. The same formula occurs in Ezekiel 3:11, 27: 13:8; 22:28, and passim. So also in 2 Samuel 7:18, 19, 20, 29; and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, etc. The latter word is used in the sense of \"cease\" or \"desist,\" as in 1 Corinthians 9:6 and Ephesians 6:9. The same formula meets us in ver. 7; Ezekiel 3:11, 27. The prophet is warned beforehand of the (at least) probable failure of his mission, wholly or in part. We note the parallelism of thought, though not language, in 2 Corinthians 2:15, 16. Such, at all times, has been the condition of the prophet's work. The expectation is grounded upon the antecedent fact of their being a \"rebellious people.\" There is the consolation that in the end, partly through the fulfilment of his words, partly, it may be, through the witness of their own conscience, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them (comp. Ezekiel 33:33; Jeremiah 28:9). We note that it is the first time that Ezekiel claims that name for himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Though briers and thorns be with thee. The two Hebrew nouns are not found elsewhere, and have consequently puzzled translators. The LXX. gives two verbs, παροιστρήσπυσιν καὶ ἐπισυστήσονται ἐπὶ σὲ; the Vulgate, increduli et subversores. The words, however, are formed from roots that imply \"pricking\" or \"burning,\" and the Authorized Version rendering, followed by the Revised Version, is tenable enough. A cognate form of the first is found in Ezekiel 28:24, and there the LXX. gives σκόλοψ, and the Vulgate, spina. A like figurative use of \"scorpions\" is found in 1 Kings 12:11 (but here the reference may be to some scorpion like scourge) and Ecclus. 26:7 (compare also our Lord's words in Luke 10:19). Be not afraid Compare the like command in Jeremiah 1:17. The words imply, probably, a past as well as a future experience. Ezekiel had already known what it was to dwell among those whose hearts were venomous as scorpions. The comparison was a sufficiently familiar one among both Eastern and Greek writers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou shalt speak my words, etc. The words conveyedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) a ground of encouragement in the fact that the words would be given by Jehovah (romp. Jeremiah 1:7, 17; Matthew 10:19, 20); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) a warning against the intermingling of lower thoughts and a self-originated message (Ezekiel 13:7; Ezekiel 22:28). They are most rebellious; literally, the Hebrew being a noun, they are rebellion, or stubbornness, itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Be not thou rebellious, etc. The words convey a warning against the prophet's natural weakness. Instinctively he shrank, as Moses had done (Exodus 3:11; Exodus 4:10-13) and Isaiah (Isaiah 6:5) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:6), from his dread vocation of being a \"mortal vessel of the Divine Word.\" In so shrinking he would identify himself with the very \"rebellion\" which he was sent to reprove, and would incur its punishment. Eat that I give thee. As in the parallel of Revelation 10:9, the words imply that what was to be given him was no message resting, as it were, on the surface of the soul. It was to enter into the prophet's innermost life, to be the food and nourishment of his soul; to be, in our familiar phrase, \"inwardly digested\" and incorporated with his very flesh and blood. He was to live \"not by bread only\" (Deuteronomy 6:3), but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - An hand was sent (put forth, Revised Version) unto me, etc. Apparently the hand was not that of the human form seated on the throne (Ezekiel 1:26), nor of one of the four living creatures (Ezekiel 1:8), but one appearing mysteriously by itself, as in the history of Belshazzar's feast (Daniel 5:5). The words connect themselves with the use of the hand stretched out of a cloud as the symbols of the Divine energy both in Jewish and Christian art. The writer has in his possession a Jewish brass tablet, probably of the sixteenth century, commemorating the legend of the miraculous supply of oil at the Feast of the Dedication, in which such a hand appears as pouring oil into the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp, of the temple. Lo, a roll of a book, etc. The words remind us of the volume, or roll, in Psalm 40:7; Jeremiah 36:2; Zechariah 5:1; like those which are still used in Jewish synagogues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - It was written within and without. Commonly such rolls, whether of vellum or papyrus, were written on one side only. This, like the tables of stone (Exodus 32:15), was written, as a symbol of the fulness of its message, on both sides. And as he looked at the roll thus \"spread before\" him, he saw that it was no evangel, no glad tidings, that he had thus to identify with his work, but one from first to last of lamentations, and mourning, and woe. Jeremiah had been known as the prophet of weeping, and was about this time (probably a little later) writing his own Lamentations (the Hebrew title of the book, however, is simply its first words) over the fall of Jerusalem. Ezekiel's work was to be of a like nature. The word meets us again (Ezekiel 19:1, 14; Ezekiel 26:17; Ezekiel 27:2, 32; Ezekiel 28:12; Ezekiel 32:2, 16) as the keynote of his writings. Out of such a book, though the glad tidings were to come afterwards, his own prophetic work was to be evolved.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The word of the Lord came again, etc. The section that follows, ending with Ver. 18, is exceptional as standing without a date. It may be eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) a continuation of the prophecy in Ezekiel 29:17-21, and so belong to the latest years of Ezekiel's work; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that prophecy may be regarded as standing by itself - a parenthesis inserted at a later date, so that we go back to the earlier word of the Lord in Ezekiel 29:1-16. Jerome, Havernick, Hitzig, Rosenmüller, Kliefoth, and others are in favor of the former view, chiefly on the ground that Ver. 3 speaks of the nearness of the coming judgment. That the day of the Lord should be \"near\" is, however, too vague and relative a term to be decisive. On the whole, the question must be left as one which we have no sufficient data for solving. The close parallelism with Ezekiel 29. seems to me slightly in favor of the second view.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Howl ye. The words read like an echo of Isaiah 13:6, and find a parallel also in Joel 1:11, 13; Zephaniah 1:7, 14. Woe worth the day! It may be well to note that the familiar phrase is a survival of the Anglo-Saxon verb weorthan (German werden), \"to become,\" so that its exact meaning is \"Woe be to the day\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The day of the Lord. Here, as everywhere (see note on Ezekiel 13:5), the words stand for any time in which the Divine judgments manifest themselves in the world's history. Of it Ezekiel says, following in the footsteps of Joel (Joel 2:2), that it shall be a day of cloud, i.e. of darkness and trouble; a day of the heathen, i.e. a time in which the heathen who had exulted in the punishment of Israel should know that the Lord was their Judge also, that he had his \"day\" appointed for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Great pain shall be in Ethiopia. The words point to the extension of the invasion of Egypt - by Nebuchadnezzar in the first instance, and afterwards by other conquerors - to the upper valley of the Nile. They shall take away her multitude. The word is taken by Keil, Smend, and others of things rather than persons, the multitude of possessions. Hengstenberg renders \"tumult\" in the sense of the stir of a crowded city. The foundations are probably to be taken figuratively of the bases of the prosperity of Egypt, its allies and mercenaries, rather than of actual buildings (comp. Psalm 11:3; Psalm 82:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEthiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Libya. Here the Authorized Version gives (rightly enough, though inconsistently) the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Phut, which is reproduced in the Revised Version. The Lydians, in like manner, stand for Lud; but we have to remember, as before (Ezekiel 27:10), that they are the African, and not the Asiatic, people of that name. In Jeremiah 46:9 the two nations are named among the auxiliaries of Egypt. Possibly the similarity of name may have led to the term being used also for the Lydian and Ionian forces enlisted by Psam-metichus I. (Herod., 3:4); but there seems more reason for including these in the mingled people that are next mentioned. Chub, or Cub (Revised Version), is found here only, and has consequently given occasion to many guesses Havernick connects it with the Kufa, a district of Media, often named in Egyptian monuments; Michaelis, with Kobe on the Ethiopian coast of the Indian Ocean; Maurer, with Cob, a city of Mauretania; Gesenius, Ewald, and Bunsen suggest the reading Nub, and identify it with Nubia; Keil and Smend adopt the form Lub, found in the Lubim of 2 Chronicles 16:8 and Nahum 3:9. On the whole, there are no adequate data for the solution of the problem. The men of the land that is in league. Here, again, we are in a region of many conjectures.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Hitzig and Kliefoth (following Jerome and the LXX., which gives, \"the land of my covenant\") take it of Canaan, as being the land in covenant with Jehovah (Psalm 74:2, 20; Daniel 11:28; Acts 3:25).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Hengstenberg, for the Sabeans, as being members of the Judaeo-Egyptian confederacy implied in Ezekiel 23:42.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Keil, Ewald, and Smend, of a people among the allies of Egypt, unknown to us, but sufficiently designated by Ezekiel for his readers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They that uphold Egypt. The words include the allies named in Ver. 5; but also embrace the rulers, generals, perhaps the idols, of Egypt itself. From the tower of Syene. As before, in Ezekiel 29:10, \"from Migdol to Syene.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when all her helpers shall be destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In that day shall messengers, etc. The whole passage seems an echo of Isaiah 18:2. The ships are those that bear the tidings of the conquest of Lower Egypt to the upper valley of the Nile. The careless Ethiopians are so named as confiding in their remoteness from the scene of action. They thought themselves safe, and were lulled into a false security (comp. Isaiah 32:9-11 and Zephaniah 2:15, for a like rendering of the verb). As in the day of Egypt. As Isaiah (Isaiah 9:4) refers to \"the day of Midian,\" so Ezekiel points to the memorable time when like tidings of the judgments that fell on Egypt carried dismay into the hearts of the surrounding nations (Exodus 15:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. Hitherto (on the assumption that Ezekiel 29:17-21 stands by itself, and that we are still in the prophetic message of Ezekiel 29:1-16) the predictions have been general. Now Ezekiel, following in the footsteps of Jeremiah (Ezekiel 46.), specifies the Chaldean king and his people, the terrible of the nations (as in Ezekiel 28:7; Ezekiel 31:12, et al.), as those who were to execute the Divine judgments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will make the rivers dry. The rivers are the Nile-blanches of the Delta, and their being dried up points, perhaps, literally to a failure in the inundation of the Nile on which its fertility depended; figuratively to a like failure of all its sources of prosperity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Noph, or, as in Hosea 9:6, Moph, is a form of the Egyptian M'noph, the reek Memphis (so in the LXX.), the capital of Lower Egypt, the chief center of the worship of Phthah, whom the Greeks identified with Hephaestos. Hence the special mention of the idols and images.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments in No.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - (For Pathros, see note on Ezekiel 29:14.) Zoan - joined with Noph in Isaiah 19:11, mentioned in Numbers 13:22 as older than Hebron - is the Tanis of the Greeks, situated on the Tanitic branch of the Delta of the Nile. No; or, as in Nahum 3:8, No Amon (equivalent to \"the abode of Ammen\"), the sacred name of the Egyptian Thebes. The LXX. gives Diospolis; the Vulgate, by a curious anachronism, Alexandria.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - Sin. The name signifies \"mire,\" like the Greek Pelusium (so the Vulgate), from πήλος (Strabo, 17. p. 802). The modern name Pheromi has the same meaning. The remains of an old fortress near the town are still known as Tineh, the \"clay\" of Daniel 2:41. The fortress stood on the eastern branch of the Nile, surrounded by swamps, and its position made it, in modern phrase, the \"key\" of Egypt. Suidas and Strabo (ut supra) describe it as an obstacle to invaders from the East. Ezekiel, in describing it as \"the strength of Egypt,\" must have known its local characteristics. The multitude of No; in the Hebrew, as in Jeremiah 46:25, Hamon-No. Did the prophet, after the manner of Micah 1:10-14, indulge in a play on the full name of the city as given in Nahum 3:8? The LXX. as before, gives Diospolis, and the Vulgate Alexandria. Noph shall have distresses daily. So the Vulgate, angustiae quotidianae. Hitizig and Keil, however, take the words as \"troubles in the day-time.\" The city should be attacked, not by night (Obadiah 1:5), but in open day (compare \"the spoiler at noonday\" of Jeremiah 15:8). The LXX. emits the name of the city, and renders, \"waters shall be poured out.\" For Sin the LXX. here gives, following a different reading, \"Syene.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The young men of Aven; the \"On\" of Genesis 12:45, the \"house of the sun\" of Jeremiah 43:13, the Heliopolis of the LXX. and Vulgate. The form Avert (Hebrews for \"a vain thing!\" as in Hosea 4:15; Hosea 10:5) was perhaps chosen as a word of scorn pointing to the idolatry of the city. Pibeseth; LXX., Bubastos. The city situated on the Suez Canal, begun by Necho and finished under Ptolemy II. (Herod., 2:59). It derived its name from the eat-headed goddess Pasht, and was the chief seat of the home which was named after it. It was destroyed by the Persians (Diod. Sic., 15:51), but the name lingers in Tebbastat, a heap of ruins about seven hours journey from the Nile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - At Tehaphnehes; the Tabu-panes of Jeremiah 2:16; Jeremiah 42:7; Jeremiah 44:1; Jeremiah 46:14; (where it appears as having a royal palace); the Taphnae of the LXX.; the Daphne of Herod., 2:30. It was another frontier-fortress in the neighborhood of Pelusium, built by Psammetichus. It may, perhaps, be represented by the modern Tel-ed-Defenne, about twenty-seven miles southwest of Pelusium. The day shall be darkened. The normal image for the departure of the sunshine of prosperity, as in Ver. 3 and Ezekiel 32:7 (comp. Amos 5:20; Amos 8:9; Isaiah 5:30; Jeremiah 13:16, etc.). The yokes of Egypt. Commonly, as in Ezekiel 34:27; Leviticus 26:13; Jeremiah 27:2; Jeremiah 28:10, 12, the phrase would imply the deliverance of Egypt from the yoke of oppression suffered at the hand of others. Here that sense is clearly inappropriate. The LXX. and Vulgate give \"the scepters\" of Egypt, which implies a different reading, and this is adopted in substance by Ewald and Smend, the latter preferring rendering it by \"supports\" or \"props,\" the \"red\" being used as a \"staff\" rather than as a \"scepter\" (comp. Ezekiel 19:14; Jeremiah 43:8; Jeremiah 48:17). The pomp of her strength. The phrase meets us again in Ezekiel 33:28, and includes what we speak of as the parade of power, here probably with a view to the foreign forces that garrisoned both Daphne and Pelusium. The daughters may be literally the women of the city, who were to share the usual fate of their sex on the capture of a city; or as in Ezekiel 26:6, 8; or probably as in Ezekiel 16:53, 55, for the villages and towns dependent on the strong city. On the whole, looking to the mention of the \"young men\" in Ver. 17, the literal meaning seems preferable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I execute judgments in Egypt: and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In the eleventh year, etc. Assuming that the whole section, Ezekiel 29:17-30:19, were a later insertion, that which follows was written in April, B.C. 586. Its contents show that it was written at or about the time of the abortive attempt of Pharaoh-Hophra to come to the relief of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 34:21; Jeremiah 37:5-7). This was the breaking of the arm of Egypt, of which the next verse speaks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, to put a roller to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I have broken the arm. The metaphor was in itself one of the most familiar (Ezekiel 17:9; Ezekiel 22:6; 1 Samuel 2:31; Jeremiah 48:25). What is characteristic in Ezekiel is the way in which he follows the figure, so to speak, into its surgical details. A man with a broken arm might be cured and fight again; but it was not to be so with Pharaoh. His arm was not to be bound with a roller (the equivalent of the modern process of putting it in \"splints\"). The Hebrew word for \"roller\" is not found elsewhere, and Ezekiel's use of it is one of the instances of his knowledge of surgery. The corresponding verb is used by him of the bandages or swaddling-clothes of infancy (Ezekiel 16:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-24. - The strong, and that which was broken. The image is pressed yet further. A warrior whose sword-arm was broken might go on fighting with his left. Hophra might continue to struggle, though with diminished strength. Ezekiel's words shut out the hope of any such struggle. The left arm also should be broken as the right had been. The Chaldean king should wax stronger and stronger. The sword of Nebuchadnezzar should be as truly \"the sword of Jehovah,\" as that of Gideon had been (Judges 7:18). Figuratively, he should stand before him groaning as a man wounded to the death. So in Jeremiah 43:9; Jeremiah 44:30; Jeremiah 46:26, we have allusions to an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, which was to end in his sitting on his throne in the stronghold of Tahapanes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - The imagery is slightly varied. The arms of the Egyptian king are described, not as broken, but as feeble. They hang down by his side instead of wielding the sword. I will scatter, etc. The prophet dwells once more, repeating the very words of Ver. 23 and Ezekiel 29:12 with all the emphasis of iteration, on the dispersion which was the almost inevitable sequel of an Oriental conquest. There in the land of exile they should see that they had been fighting against God; and so the prophet ends the chapter with his ever-recurring formula, They shall know that I am Jehovah (Ezekiel 28:26; Ezekiel 29:21).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel30:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the eleventh year, etc. June, B.C. 586. Two months all but six days had passed since the utterance of Ezekiel 30:20-26, when Ezekiel was moved to expand his prediction of the downfall of Egypt into a parable which is partly a replica of these in Ezekiel 17. and Ezekiel 19:1-14, and which also finds a parallel in Daniel 4:10-14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The parable is addressed, not to Pharaoh only, but to his multitude i.e., as in Ezekiel 30:4, for his auxiliary forces. It opens with one of the customary formulae of an Eastern apologue (Mark 4:30), intended to sharpen the curiosity and win the attention of the prophet's hearers or readers. It is significant that the question is repeated at the close of the parable, as if the prophet had left the interpretation to his readers, as our Lord does in saying, \"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon. The Hebrew text, as rendered in all versions and interpreted by most commentators, gives us, in the form of the parable of the cedar, the history of the Assyrian empire in its glory and its fall. That had passed away in spite of its greatness, and so should Egypt. The question in Ver. 18 takes the place of \"Thou art the man!\" in Nathan's interpretation of his parable (2 Samuel 12:7), or the mutato nominee de te fabula, narratur of the Roman satirist. Some recent commentaters, however, either like Ewald, taking the Hebrew word for, Assyrian\" as describing a particular kind of cedar or fir tree, or, like Comill and amend, adopting a conjectural emendation of the text which actually gives that meaning (Tasshur for Asshur), refer the whole parable primarily to Egypt, and dwell on the fact that the words of Vers. 10, 18 are addressed to the living representative of a great monarchy, and not to a power that has already passed away into the Hades of departed glory. The former view seems to me the more tenable of the two, and I therefore adopt it throughout the chapter. It may be admitted, however, that the inner meaning of the parable at times breaks through the outward imagery, as was indeed to be expected, the prophet seeking to apply his apologue even before he had completed it. The \"cedar in Lebanon\" has already met us as the symbol of s kingdom, in Ezekiel 17:2. The shadowing shroud may be noted as a specially vivid picture of the peculiar foliage of the cedar rendered with singular felicity. His top was among the thick boughs; better, clouds, as in the margin of the Revised Version. So Keil, Smend, and others (comp. Vers. 10, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The waters made him great. The scenery is hardly that of Lebanon, but finds its counterpart in that of the Nile, perhaps also of the Tigris, with the waters of the river diverted into streams and channels by a careful system of irrigation. The cedar grew close to the river itself; the other trees of the field were watered only by the smaller channels, and so were inferior to it in the fullness of their growth. (For the general imagery, comp. Ezekiel 17:5; Psalm 1:3; Jeremiah 17:8; Numbers 24:6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - All the fowls of heaven as in Ezekiel 17:23; Daniel 4:9; Matthew 13:32, was the natural symbol of the fact that all the neighboring nations owned the sovereignty of Assyria and were sheltered by her protection. In the great nation we have the parable passing into its interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The cedars in the garden of God. As in Ezekiel 28:13, the thoughts of the prophet dwell on the picture of Eden in Genesis 2:8. Far above all other trees, the cedar of Assyria rose high in majesty. All the trees that were in the garden of God envied him. The trees specially chosen for comparison areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the fir tress - probably, as in Ezekiel 27:5, the cypresses; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the chestnut trees, for which the Revised Version, following the Vulgate and the LXX. of Genesis 30:97, gives the \"plane,\" which held a high place in the admiration of Greek and Roman writers. Of this we have a special instance in the story of Xerxes, who decorated a plane tree near the Meander with ornaments of gold (Herod., 7:31; 'AElicon,' 5:14; also comp. Ecclus. 24:14; Virg., 'Georg.,' 4:146; Cicero, 'De Ont.,' 1:7, 28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Because thou hast lifted up thyself. The second and third persons are curiously mixed; probably the former was in the nature of a warning addressed to the King of Egypt, while the latter continues the parable of the history of Assyria. For boughs read clouds, as in Ver. 3. Ezekiel writes as with the feeling which led Solon to note that the loftiest trees are those which are most exposed to the strokes of the thunderbolts of Zeus (Herod., 7:10). The Assyrian's heart was \"lifted up with pride\" (Isaiah 10:5), and therefore he was delivered to the mighty one of the nations; sc. to Nebuchadnezzar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Strangers, the terrible of the nations. We note the recurrence of the phrase of Ezekiel 30:11, as pointing, here as there, to the Chaldean invaders. The branches of the tree were broken, the people of the earth no longer dwelt under its shadow (Daniel 4:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Upon his ruin. The prophet, as it were, corrects his imagery. The birds and beasts are still there, but instead of dwelling in the boughs, they (vultures and owls, jackals and hyenas) hover and creep as over the carcass of the dead, decaying trunk.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - To the end that none, etc. With a characteristic amplitude of style, Ezekiel preaches the great lesson of the mutability of earthly greatness. This was the lesson that the history of Assyria ought to have taught the nations of the earth, and it was just that lesson that they refused to learn. They are all delivered to death. The scenery of the parable passes from Eden to Sheol, the Hades of the nations, and the prophet gives the first stroke of the imagery afterwards more fully developed in Ezekiel 32:17-32.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I covered the deep for him. The face of the whole world of nature is painted by the prophet as sharing in the awe and terror of that tremendous fail Lebanon was made to mourn (literally, to be black), the waters failed in their channels, the trees (all that drink water) shuddered. They formed part, as it were, of the pageantry of woe at the funeral of the fallen kingdom. It is as if the prophet felt, in all its intensity, what we have learnt to call the sympathy of nature with the sorrows of humanity. It would, perhaps, be over-literal to press details; but the picture, in one of its features at least, suggests a failure of the inundation of the Nile, like that indicated in Ezekiel 30:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Shall be comforted, etc. The Dante-like imagination of the prophet points the contrasts between the impression made by the fall of Assyria on the nations that yet survived, and on those that had already perished. The former mourn and shako with fear, for it is a warning to them that their turn also may come. On the other hand, the tress of Eden - the great monarchies that are already in Sheol - shall he \"comforted\" with the thought that yet another kingdom mightier than they has fallen as they fell (comp. Isaiah 14:4-20; Ezekiel 32:17-32, where the thought is elaborately expanded).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They that were his arm. The words point to the allies, in the first instance of Assyria, and secondly of Egypt. The last words of the verse present a striking parallel to Lamentations 4:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - To whom art thou thus like, etc.? As in Ver. 10, the prophet passes from the past to the present, from the third person to the second, and as it were says to Hophra, \"Thou art the man! all that I have said of Assyria is true of thee.\" This is Pharaoh and all his multitude. In the midst of thin uncircumcised (see note on Ezekiel 28:10). As a matter of fact, the Egyptians practiced circumcision, and Ezekiel must be thought of as using the term as simply an epithet of scorn.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the twelfth year, etc. March, B.C. 584, nineteen months attar the destruction of Jerusalem. The two sections of the chapter, Vers. 1-16 and 17-32, belong to the same year, and probably, though the date of the month is net given for the second, were written within a fortnight of each other. The thoughts of the prophet still dwell upon the downfall of Egypt, and he is stirred, as by a special inspiration, to write an elaborate \"lamentation\" over its departed greatness. It would seem, from the repetition of the word in Ver. 16, as if the elegy had originally been intended to end there. Possibly it may have occurred to the prophet that what he had written was rather a prediction of coming evil than a lamentation, and therefore needed to be completed by a second, coming more strictly under that title.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou art like a young lion; rather, with the Revised Version, thou wast likened unto a young lion. The two clauses of the verse stand in direct contrast to each other. Flatterers, orators, courtiers, had used the usual symbolism of the animal world. The King of Egypt was as the king of beasts. Ezekiel rejects that comparison, and likens him rather to the whale, the dragon (Revised Version), in the seas, i.e. to the crocodile of his own river (compare the use of the \"dragon\" for the King of Egypt, in Ezekiel 29:3; Isaiah 51:9). Ewald and Smend, however, translate, \"young lion of the nations, thou art brought to naught;\" but there is no adequate reason for abandoning the Revised translation. Troubledst the waters. As in Ezekiel 34:18, the act is used as the symbol of all selfish and aggressive rule, defiling the streams of righteousness and judgment. Thou camest forth with thy rivers. Ewald and Smend translate, \"Thou didst spurt out the water,\" as describing the act of the crocodile when it raises its head out of the water as in the \"neesings,\" or \"sneezings\" of Job 41:12, Hebrew [English version, 18].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will spread out my net. The imagery of Ezekiel 29:3 is repeated, with a variation as to the mode of capture. There is no evidence that the crocodile was ever taken with a net; but Ezekiel may have chosen the comparison for that very reason. What was impossible in the parable, according to its letter, was possible when it received its application.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The picture is carried out to its completion. The carcass of the crocodile becomes the prey of unclean birds and beasts. The carcass of the Egyptian greatness was to satiate the appetite of the invading hosts. Were the words of Psalm 74:14, as to leviathan being \"given for meat to the people in the wilderness\" floating in Ezekiel's mind (compare the strange reference to leviathan in 2 Esdr. 6:49, 52, and in later Jewish traditions)? Greek writers describe the ichthyophagi of Africa as feeding on the flesh of sea-monsters (Died. Sic, 3:14; Herod., 2:69; Strabo, p. 773), and the word may possibly include the crocodile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will water with thy blood. Was the plague of the water of the Nile turned to blood (Exodus 7:19, 20) present to Ezekiel's mind? Such an inundation of the Nile, in all its horrors, was a fit symbol of the deluge of invaders by whom Egypt was laid waste.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - When I shall put thee out; better, with the Revised Version, extinguish. The verb is used of lamps in 2 Chronicles 29:7. The change of metaphor is at first startling, but I follow Ewald, Hitzig, and Smend, in thinking that there is a traceable sequence of ideas. The \"dragon of the Egyptian waters\" suggested the \"dragon\" which was conspicuous between Ursa Major and Minor among the constellations of the heavens, and the name of which, probably derived by the Greek astronomers from a remote past, suggested that of an enemy of God (comp. Isaiah 51:9). So taken, the new comparison finds a parallel in that of the King of Babylon to Lucifer, the morning star, in Isaiah 14:12. Upon this there follows naturally the imagery of Ezekiel 30:18; Isaiah 34:4. As the other trees of the forest had mourned for the cedar (Ezekiel 31:15), so the other lights of heaven mourn for that particular star which has been quenched for ever (comp. for the general imagery. Isaiah 13:10; Joel 2:10; Joel 3:4, Hebrew ['English version, Ezekiel 2:31].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will also vex the hearts. The words intensify the bitterness of the downfall. The prophet passes out of the region of metaphors into that of facts. The fall of Egypt will cause pity among the nations. They shall simply be \"vexed\" in heart, terrified at the thought (Ver. 10) that the sword which had laid her low was \"brandished\" also against them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-14. - The sword of the King of Babylon, etc. The effects of Nebuchadnezzar's invasion are now described in language which seems plain enough, but in which we may read between the lines an allusive reference to the previous symbolism. Thus in Ver. 13 we are thrown back upon the thought of the \"troubled waters\" of Ver. 2. The Nile was no longer to be troubled by the foot of beasts; the streams of justice were no longer to be defiled with a selfish corruption, but were to run smooth and calm, even as the \"rivers of oil\" which were the symbols of ethical blessedness (Job 29:6; Deuteronomy 32:13). So Ewald and Keil, for once agreeing. The rule of Nebuchadnezzar was to be a righteous rule, in spite of its severity. I am unable, however, to follow these commentators further in seeing in the words a prediction of the Messianic kingdom. The Egyptians were to \"know the Lord,\" as the other nations addressed by Ezekiel were to know him, as a righteous Judge, not as yet as a Deliverer (comp. Ezekiel 28:26; Ezekiel 29:21; Ezekiel 30:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - This is the lamentation, etc. The work of mourning for the dead was for the most part assigned to women (2 Samuel 1:24; Jeremiah 9:17; 2 Chronicles 35:25), and is therefore appropriately assigned to the daughters of the nations. He hears, as it were, their wailing over the fallen greatness of Egypt, even in the solitude of Tel-Abib.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For yet fourteen days the mind of the prophet brooded over the fall of Egypt, and his thoughts at last found utterance in another lamentation, based upon that of Isaiah 14. Taken together, the two passages give a vivid picture of the thoughts of the Hebrews as to the unseen world, and we find in them the germs of the later belief of Judaism in Paradise and Gehenna. What I have called the Dante element in Ezekiel it seen here raised to its highest power. Ver 18. - Cast them down, etc. The prophet thinks of himself as not only the predictor, but the minister, of the Divine judgments. So it was given to Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:10) \"to root out and to pull down,\" and to Amos (Amos 9:1) to \"smite\" and to wound. He executes the sentence, not on Egypt only, but on the other daughters of the famous nations, sc. on the nations themselves, especially those that are named in the verses that follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Whom dost thou pass in beauty? The lamentation, as might be expected from Ezekiel's standpoint, is an illustration of irony and triumph rather than of sorrow. The question implies a negative answer. Glorious as Egypt had been, other nations had equaled her. They had passed away, and so should she. With the uncircumcised. The words, as in Ezekiel 31:18, suggest the thought that Israel, so far as it was faithful to its calling, circumcised in heart as well as flesh (Jeremiah 9:26), had a higher and happier dwelling in Hades than the uncircumcised heathen. As the Egyptians practiced circumcision, the language of the prophet had a special significance. Their place in Hades was among the heathen to whom that hereto was unknown.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - She is delivered to the sword; better, with the margin of the Revised Version, the sword is appointed - possibly, as Ewald suggests, with reference to the practice of burying a warrior with his sword beneath his head (comp. Ver. 27). Draw her, etc. The command would seem to be given, so to speak, to the warders of Sheol. They am to receive the new comers and take them to their appointed place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The strong among the mighty. Those already in Sheol watch the new arrival, and make their scornful comments (comp. Isaiah 14:9, 18), at once classing them with the uncircumcised. Had they heard, we ask, of the downfall of Egypt?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAsshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23 - Asshur is there. The verses that follow contain, as it were, the prophet's retrospect of the history of the past, as far as he had knowledge of it. Foremost in those is Assyria, which the prophet had already chosen (Ezekiel 31:3) as the pattern instance of a fallen greatness. There in the sides of the pit (i.e. in its remotest and deepest regions) lie the graves of the rulers surrounded by those of their subjects. They had caused terror, the prophet adds, with a keen irony, in the land of the living. They can cause no terror now.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - There is Elam etc. The nation so named appears grouped with Asshur in Genesis 10:22; in Isaiah 11:11 it stands between Cush and Shinar; in Isaiah 22:6 its warriors form part of the host of Sennacherib; in Ezra 4:9 they are named as having been among the settlers in Samaria; in Isaiah 21:2 as joining with the Medes in the attack on Babylon; in Jeremiah 25:25 again coupled with the Medes among the enemies of Nebuchadnezzar; in Daniel 8:2 as the province in which Shushan was situated, and therefore subject to Babylon. Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:34-39) had uttered a special prophecy against it. From Ezekiel's point of view it might well take its place among the powers that had received their death-blow at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. Yet have they borne their shame; sc. the disgrace of being uncircumcised, and therefore taking their place with the lower circles of the dead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They have set her a bed. The noun is used for the sleeping-place of the dead - the cemetery, if we trace that word to its root in Isaiah 57:2; 2 Chronicles 16:14. In the rest of the verse Ezekiel reiterates what had been said in Ver. 24 with an emphatic solemnity. In the Hebrew, as in the English, there is a constant variation in the pronouns used, now masculine, now feminine, now singular.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - There is Meshech, Tubal. (On the ethnological relations of the two tribes, see note on Ezekiel 27:13, and later on in Ezekiel 38, and 39.) Ezekiel obviously speaks of them as one of the powers that bad been conspicuous in his own time, and had been, in part at least, overthrown by the Chaldean monarchy. We may probably connect his words with the great irruption of the Scythians mentioned by Herodotus (1. 103; 4:11) as having swept over Asia even to Palestine and Egypt, in the time of Josiah, and which, after compelling Cyaxares to raise the siege of Nineveh, left traces of itself in the name of the city of Scythe-polls. Many commentators find a reference to that invasion in the \"evil from the north\" of Jeremiah 1:14; Jeremiah 4:6; and in Zephaniah 1:13-16. They also, once the terror of the nations, are now represented by the prophet as in the shadow-world of Sheol.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And they shall not lie with the mighty. The words seem at first to contradict Ver. 26. The LXX. meets the difficulty by omitting the negative; Ewald and Havernick, by taking it as an interrogative, \"Shall they not lie,\" etc.? Probably the explanation is laying stress on the word \"mighty.\" Meshech and Tubal have a lower place in Hades; they are buried without the honors of war. Their swords are not placed beneath their heads (for the practice thus referred to, see Died. Sic., 18:26; Arrian, 1:5; Virg., 'AEn.,' 6:233). For the Scythians, who worshipped the sword (Herod., L 62), this would be the extremest ignominy. In this way their iniquities should be upon their bones as they lay dishonored.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Yea, thou shalt be broken. The words are obviously addressed to Pharaoh. He must prepare himself for a like doom. His place, proud as he was of his magnificence, shall be with the wild nomad hordes of Scythia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - There is Edom, her kings and her princes. (For the political relations of Edom at this time, see Ezekiel 25:12-14.) Whatever shadow of power might yet remain to it, Ezekiel, from his standpoint, could yet declare that her greatness had departed. The exultation which the Edomites had shown over the fall of Jerusalem (Psalm 137:7) would naturally tend to accentuate the prophet's language. The \"princes\" of Edom are probably identical with the \"dukes\" of Genesis 36:15-43 and 1 Chronicles 1:51, where the word means literally the heads or captains of thousands, i.e. of tribes, as in Judges 6:15 (comp. Zechariah 9:7; Zechariah 12:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - There be the princes of the north. The noun for \"princes\" is different from that of Ver. 29, and has the sense of \"vassal rulers,\" as in Joshua 13:21; Micah 5:4. So we have the \"kings of the north\" in Jeremiah 25:26. The fact that they are coupled with the Zidonians (it is suggestive that Ezekiel names these rather than the Tyrians) points in the direction of Northern Syria, including cities like Damascus, Hamath, Arpad, and others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Shall be comforted, etc. (comp. for the thought, Ezekiel 31:16). That shall be all that he will have to console him. As before, other nations were comforted by the downfall of Egypt, so Egypt in her turn finds her comfort in their downfall. All are sharers alike in the fiend-like temper which exults in the miseries of others. Ewald and Hitzig, here as there, take the word as in the sense of \"mourning over.\" As to the extent and manner in which the predictions of the chapter have been fulfilled, see notes on Ezekiel 29. - 31. Sufficient evidence has been given that Egypt was probably invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. The silence of the Greek historians, and notably of Herodotus, as to any such invasion goes for little or nothing. He could not read the Egyptian records, and derived his knowledge from the priests through an interpreter. They, after their manner, would draw a veil over all disasters, and so, while he records the revolution which placed Amasis upon the throne of Hophra, he is silent as to any invasion, and does not even mention the battle of Carchemish.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel32:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.33":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - If we may think of Ezekiel as compiling and arranging his own prophecies, we may think of him as returning, with something like a sense of relief, to his own special work as the watchman of the house of Israel. For upwards of two years the messages which it had been given him to write (how far they were in any sense published we have no means of knowing) in Ezekiel 25-32, had dealt exclusively with foreign nations. Now his own people are again the object of his care. He resumes his pastoral office at once for warning and consolation. From this point onwards, with the exception of the strange Meshech-Tubal episode in Ezekiel 38, 39, all is leading onwards to the final vision of the rebuilt temple, and the redistributed land of Israel, and through them to the times of the Messianic restoration. No date is given here for the word of the Lord which now came to him, but it may, perhaps be inferred, from Vers. 21, 22, that it was immediately before the arrival of the messenger who brought the tidings that Jerusalem was taken. In the ecstatic state indicated by \"the hand of the Lord\" he knew that some great change was coming, that he had a new message to deliver, a new part to play.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Speak to the children of thy people. (On the force of the possessive pronoun, see note on Ezekiel 3:1.) The formula is carried on throughout the chapter (Vers. 12, 17, 30). Set him for their watchman. Ezekiel falls back upon the thought of Ezekiel 3:17, but the image is expanded with characteristic fullness. The function of the watchman, in which he sees a parable of his own office, is to stand upon his tower (2 Samuel 18:24, 25; 2 Kings 9:17; Habakkuk 2:1), to keep his eye on the distant horizon, and as soon as the clouds of dust or the gleam of armor gives notice of the approach of the enemy, to sound the trumpet of alarm (Amos 3:6; Hosea 8:1; Jeremiah 4:5; Jeremiah 6:1), that men may not be taken unawares. If he discharge that duty faithfully, then, as in Ezekiel 3:17-21, the blood of those that perish through their own negligence shall rest on their own head.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him.

The prophet asks himself whether he has acted on the warning which was borne in on his mind at the very beginning of his mission. Has he sounded the trumpet? Has he warned the people of the destruction that is coming on them? The outward imagery vanishes in Ver. 7. It is of no Chaldean invader that the prophet had to give personal and direct warning, but of each man's own special sin which was Bringing ruin on himself and on his country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thus ye speak, saying, etc. At the earlier stage the prophet had to contend with scorn, incredulity, derision (Ezekiel 12:22). They trusted in the promises of the false prophets (Ezekiel 13:6). They laid to their soul the flattering unction that they were suffering, not for their own sins, but for the sins of their fathers (Ezekiel 18:2). Now they stand face to face with the fulfillment of the prophet's words. They cherish no hopes, and they make no excuses. They have fallen into the abyss of despair. Admitting their own sin and the righteousness of their punishment, does not the very admission exclude hope? Who can bring life to those that are thus dead in trespasses and sins? The parallelism with Leviticus 26:39-42 is so striking that it can scarcely be accidentalNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Say unto them, etc. To meet that despair the prophet has to fall back on the truth which he had proclaimed once before (Ezekiel 18:32). He must appear as uttering a message of pardon resting on the unchanging character of the great Absolver. Now, as ever, it is true that he willeth not the death of the wicked, that all punishment (in this world, at least) is meant to lead to repentance, and that for those who repent there is the hope of restoration and of life. No righteousness in the past avails against the transgression of the present (Ver. 12); but then also no wickedness of the past prevails to shut out the penitent's claim to pardon. As a man is at any given moment, when the judgment comes on him, so is he dealt with. In some sense, as in Ver. 13, the righteousness of the post may become a stumbling-block. The man may trust in it, and be off his guard, ceasing to watch and pray, and so the temptation may prevail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - If the wicked restore the pledge. In Ezekiel 18:7, 12, 16, this and its opposite had been grouped with other forms of good and evil. Here it stands out in solitary preeminence. The reason may possibly be found in the fact that a time of exile and suffering was likely to make the sin, which the penitent thus showed that he had renounced, a specially common one. The starving man pledged his garment or his tools for the loan of money or of food at a price far below its value. There was a real self-sacrifice, a proof of the power of the faith that worketh by love, when the creditor restored it. The primary duty, when a man turned from evil, was, as far as in him lay, to overcome his besetting sin and make restitution for the past. Compare the words of the Baptist (Luke 3:12-14), and those of Zacchaeus (Luke 19:8). The statutes of life. The words are used as in Ezekiel 20:11 and Leviticus 18:5, on the assumption that, if a man kept the statutes, he should (in the highest sense of the word) live in them. It was reserved for the fuller illumination of St. Paul, taught by a representative experience to proclaim the higher truth that the Law, ordained for life, was yet the minister of condemnation and death unless there was something higher than itself to complete the work which it could only begin (Romans 7:10; Romans 8:3; comp. also Hebrews 7:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The way of the Lord is not equal. The prophet now proclaims what he had been taught, perhaps then, without proclaiming it, in Ezekiel 18:25-30. Men are dealt with by the Divine Judge, not as their fathers have Been before them, not even as they themselves have been in times past, but exactly as they are. Where could there be a more perfect rule of equity? The question how far Ezekiel thinks of the judgment itself as final, whether there is the possibility of repentance and pardon after it has fallen, and during its continuance, is not directly answered. He is speaking, we must remember, of a judgment on this side the grave, and therefore what we call the problems of eschatology were not before him. But the language of the document which lies at the basis of his theology (Leviticus 26:41) asserts that if men repented and, \"accepted\" their earthly punishment, then Jehovah would remember his covenant, and would not destroy them utterly. And his own language as to Sodom and Samaria (Ezekiel 16:53) indicates a leaning to the wider hope. If the problems of the unseen world had been brought before him, we may believe that he would have dealt with them as with those with which he actually came in contact, and that there also his words would have been, \"O house of Israel, O sons of men, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - In the twelfth year, etc. The capture of Jerusalem took place in the fourth month of the eleventh year (Jeremiah 39:2; Jeremiah 52:6) from the captivity of Jehoiachin and the beginning of Zedekiah's reign. Are we to assume some error of transcription? or is it within the limits of probability that eighteen months would pass without any direct communication from Jerusalem of what had passed there? There is, I conceive, nothing improbable in what is stated. The exiles of Tel-Ahib were not on the high-roads of commerce or of war. All previous communications were cut off by the presence of the Chaldean armies. In the words, one that had escaped, the prophet clearly referred to the intimation given him at the time of his wife's death (Ezekiel 24:26). When the fugitive entered he saw that the hour had at last come. One would give much to know who the fugitive was, but we can only conjecture. Had Baruch been sent by Jeremiah to bear the tidings to his brother prophet? Such a mission would have been a fulfillment of Jeremiah 45:5. A later tradition ascribes to Baruch a prominent part as a teacher among the exiles of Babylon (Bar. 1:2) shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Now the hand of the Lord. When the messenger arrived he found the prophet in a state of ecstasy. This was in the evening. In that prophetic ecstasy his mouth was opened, and the long silence broken, and though he had not heard the message with his outward ears, he had taken, as it were, that message as his text. It was not till his discourse was ended, and the morning came, that he himself heard the terrible tidings from the lips of the messenger. Then a change came over him. He was no more dumb. The long silence was broken. Had the silence lasted, we ask, from Ezekiel 3:26 onward? Had the whole intervening period been one of simply symbolic action, and of written but unspoken prophecies? The words at first suggest that conclusion; but it is traveled by the facts; by the commands of Ezekiel 12:10, 23; by the order to \"prophesy\" in Ezekiel 13:2; by the message to speak unto the elders in Ezekiel 14:4; by the question, \"Doth he not speak parables?\" of Ezekiel 20:49. I infer, therefore, that, though the silence had been dominant, it had not been unbroken. To some, at least, a message had been spoken. Others may have been allowed to read the written prophecies. The death of the prophet's wife tended, probably, to the continuance of the silence, and it seems a legitimate inference from Ezekiel 24:27 that it had continued from that date onward.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They that inhabit thou wastes of the land. The utterance that follows was probably the direct result of what Ezekiel heard from the messenger. He it was who reported the boastful claims of those who had been left in the land by the Chaldean armies - the \"bad figs\" of Jeremiah's parable, the least worthy representatives of the seed of Abraham. the assassins of Gedaliah (Jeremiah 41:1, 2), who in these \"waste places,\" the dens and eaves in which they found a refuge (or, it may be, the phrase describes the condition of the whole country), led the lives of outlaws and bandits. The very words of their boast are reproduced: \"Abraham, when he was yet but one, received the premise of inheritance. We are comparatively many, and are left as the true seed of Abraham (comp. Matthew 3:9). The land is ours, and we will take possession of the estates of the exiles.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Ye eat with the blood. It is characteristic of Ezekiel that the first offence which he names with horror should be a sin against a positive commandment. He felt, as it were, a sense of loathing at what seemed to him a descent into the worst form of pollution, forbidden, not to the Jews only (Leviticus 17:10; Leviticus 19:26; Deuteronomy 12:16), but to mankind (Genesis 9:4); compare the scene in 1 Samuel 14:32. The same feeling shows itself in Zechariah 9:7 and Acts 15:20, 29. The prohibition of blood took its place, in later Judaism, as among the precepts of Noah, which were binding even on the proselytes of the gate, upon whom, as distinct from the proselytes of righteousness, the rite of circumcision was not enforced; and as such were accepted by the council at Jerusalem, as binding also among Christian converts. Not for such as these was the inheritance of Israel, and the prophet asks indignantly, after naming yet . more hateful offenses, Shall ye possess the land?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Ye stand upon your sword. The words point to the open assertion of the law that might is right. Men relied on the sword, and on that only, for their support. Assassinations, as in Jeremiah 41, were, so to speak, as the order of the day. Ye work abomination. The noun, Ezekiel's ever-recurring word, indicates both the act of idolatry and the foul orgiastic rites that accompanied it. The verb, curiously enough, has the feminine suffix. Was it used intentionally, either as pointing to the prominence of women in those rites (Jeremiah 44:15), or to the degrading vices which involved the loss of true manhood (2 Kings 23:7)? So some have thought; but I agree with Keil, Smend, and others, in seeing only an error of transcription. Once more, after heaping up his accusations, Ezekiel asks the question, \"Shall ye possess the land?\" \"Are you the seed of Abraham?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - They that are in the wastes. The words paint, with a terrible vividness, what was passing in Ezekiel's fatherland. Did the fugitives of Judah seek the open country? they were exposed to the sword of the Chaldeans or of marauding outlaws. Did they seek safety in fortresses or caves? they were exposed, crowded together as they were under the worst possible conditions, to the ravages of pestilence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The children of thy people. The words, like those of Ezekiel 14:1 and Ezekiel 20:1, 49, throw light on the prophet's relations to his people. Now that the long silence was broken, and the prophet spoke with greater freedom than he had ever done before, he acquired a fresh notoriety. The character of his last utterance, vindicating, as it might seem, the claim of the exiles to \"possess the land,\" as against that of the remnant \"in the wastes,\" may even have made him popular. The Authorized Version against is misleading; read, with the margin and the Revised Version, about. There was for the time no open hostility. They talked much, in places of private or public resort, of the prophet's new action. Each invited his neighbor to go and hear the prophet as he spake to them his message from Jehovah. And they came as the people cometh, in crowds, even as my people, the people of Jehovah, with reverent gestures and listening eagerly. Never before, we may well believe, had the prophet had so large or so promising a congregation. But he was taught to look below the surface and to read their thoughts, and there he read, as preachers of all ages have too often read after him, that they were hearers, and not doers (Matthew 7:24-27; James 1:23-25). In words they showed much love (the LXX. gives \"falsehood\"), spoke pleasant things, but the root-evil, the besetting sin, was still there. Their heart went after their covetousness (camp. Matthew 13:22; 2 Timothy 4:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - A very lovely song; literally, a song of love, an erotic idyll, the word being the same as in Ver. 31. Yet this was the meaning of the large gathering. They came to hear the prophet, as they would to hear a hired singer at a banquet, like those of Amos 6:5. The prophet's words passed over them and left no lasting impression. All that they sought was the momentary tickling of the sense. The words receive a special significance from Psalm 137:3. The Jewish exiles were famous among their conquerors for the minstrel's art. The nobler singers refused to \"sing the songs of Zion in a strange land;\" others, it may be, were not so scrupulous. Had the prophet seen his people gather to listen to such a singer? Were they better occupied when they were listening to his message from Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel33:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - When this cometh to pass. The words can scarcely refer to the immediately preceding predictions in Vers. 27, 28, which were primarily addressed to \"the people in the waste places,\" the remnant left in Judah, and we have to go back to the wider, more general teaching of Vers. 10-20. That was the prophet's message of judgment, his call to repentance. When the judgment should come, as it surely would, then they would know, in the bitterness of self-condemnation, that they had been listening, not to a hireling singer, but to a prophet of Jehovah.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And the word of the Lord, etc. As no date is given, we may infer that what follows came as an almost immediate sequel to that which precedes it. The kernel of the chapter is found in the Messianic prophecies of vers. 23, 24, as the first stage in the restoration of Israel which is beginning to open to the prophet's gaze. We can hardly avoid seeing in it the deliberate expression of words that had been spoken by Ezekiel's master (Jeremiah 23:1-4), and which in his case also were followed by a directly Messianic announcement. In Matthew 9:36, still more in John 10:1-16, we can scarcely avoid recognizing the distinct appropriation of the words to himself by him of whom they both had spoken. So far as we may venture to speculate on the influence, so to speak, of the words of the prophets of the Old Testament on our Lord's human soul, we may think of these as having marked out for him the work which he was to do, just as we may think of Psalm 22. and Isaiah 53. as having pointed out to him the path of suffering which he was to tread.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, etc. Our modern associations with the words, our use of terms like\" the pastoral office,\" \"the pastoral Epistles,\" lead us to think of the priests and prophets, the spiritual guides of the people, as being those whom the prophet has in view. In the language of the Old Testament, however, as in that of Homer ('Iliad,' 1:1. 263; 2:1. 85, etc.), the shepherds of the people are always its kings and other civil rulers (1 Kings 22:17; Psalm 77:20; Psalm 78:71; Jeremiah 23:1-6), and those whom Ezekiel had in his thoughts were the tyrannous rulers of the house of David, like Jehoiakim and Zedekiah and their satellites. Our Christian thoughts of the word are the outcome of the leading of John 10:1-16; John 21:15-17; 1 Peter 5:2-4; Acts 20:28; but it is probably true that even there the original thought is still dominant. Christ is the \"good Shepherd,\" because he is the true King. His ministers are shepherds as being officers in his kingdom. Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? The question is an appeal to the universal conscience of Israel and of mankind. No shepherd was worthy of his name who did not do that which the very name implied. He that neglects that duty is simply as a hireling or a robber (John 10:10, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Ye eat the fat. The LXX. and the Vulgate, following a different reading, give milk, and, as \"killing\" comes in the next clause, this is probably preferable (comp. 1 Corinthians 9:7; Isaiah 7:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The diseased have ye not strengthened. The verbs indicate the difference between the \"diseased,\" i.e. the weak sheep (comp. Isaiah 40:11; Psalm 78:71) and the sick, that were suffering from more definite maladies. So the broken are the sheep that have fallen from a rock and thus maimed themselves. Each case required its appropriate treatment, and none had met with it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And they were scattered. The words are an echo of 1 Kings 22:17, and are, in their turn, echoed by Matthew 9:36. The words that follow paint the sufferings of the exiles who left their homes and were scattered among the heathen in the days of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. Of these the kings took no heed, and shut themselves up in the luxurious seclusion of their palace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - As I live, saith the Lord God, etc. The sentence of the Supreme Judge, of the \"chief Shepherd\" (1 Peter 5:4), that follows, is naturally preceded by a recapitulation of the guilt of the tyrannous rulers - the \"idol\" or sham shepherds of Zechariah 11:17 (comp. also Zechariah 10:3). Both chapters should be studied as throwing light on the teaching of the earlier prophet. It may be noted also how the thought enters into Ezekiel's vision of the restored Israel (Ezekiel 45:8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Behold, I, even I, etc. The words, as the last reference shows, and as we find in vers. 23-31, do not exclude, rather they imply, human instrumentality, just us our Lord's do in Matthew 18:12 and Luke 15:4-7; but they reveal the truth that Jehovah is the true Shepherd of his people. Not the sweet psalmist of Israel only, but the lowest outcast, might use the language of Psalm 23, and say, \"The Lord is my Shepherd.\" He will gather the sheep that have been scattered in the \"cloudy and dark day,\" the day of the Lord's judgment (Ezekiel 30:3). For the prophet the words pointed to that vision of a restored Israel, which was dominant in the expectations both of Isaiah (or the Deutero-Isaiah) in Ezekiel 40-48, and in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 33:12-18), which floated before the minds of the apostles (Acts 1:6), and to which even St. Paul looked forward as the solution of the great problems of the world's history (Romans 9-11.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-15. - On the mountains of Israel by the rivers. The picture of the pleasant pasture-lands of Judah, almost, as it were, an expansion of Psalm 23, of the mountains which are not barren and stony, of the streams that flow calmly in the inhabited places of the country, serves as a parable of that which is to follow on the restoration of Israel. The sheep that had been wandering so long in the wilderness should at last lie down in a fat pasture (ver. 15), and the tender care of the Shepherd should watch with an individualizing pity over each sheep that had been brought back. Every broken limb should be bound up. Every sickness should be treated with its appropriate means of healing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will destroy the fat and the strong. What follows introduces another feature into the parable, and is hardly less than an anticipation of the great scene of judgment in Matthew 25:32. The \"fat and the strong,\" as contrasted with the \"broken\" and the \"sick,\" are, when we interpret the Darable, the noble and wealthy who, under the kings of Judah, had been allowed to work their evil will upon the people. Of these he says that he will feed them with (better, in) judgment, that for them there must be the discipline of punishment. They too are his sheep, but they require a different treatment from the others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle. It may be worth while to note, as modern English usage tends to limit the range of the word, that it is commonly used in the Old Testament of sheep rather than of kine (Genesis 30:34-42; Genesis 31:8-12). In Genesis 30:32 we have the same Hebrew word as that which Ezekiel uses. Between the rams and the he-goats. The words, at first, seem to point to a division like that of Matthew 25:32, and may, perhaps, have suggested it. Here, however, the contrast lies, not between the sheep and goats as such, but between the strong and the weak of each class. The \"rams\" are as much the object of the shepherd's discipline of judgment as the \"he-goats.\" Both stand as the representative of the rapacious self-seeking classes who oppressed the poor and needy, and, not content with being the first to feed on the pastures and to drink of the waters, trampled on the former and defiled the latter. So in the next verse the contrast lies between the \"fat cattle,\" whether sheep or goats, and the \"lean.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And I will set up one Shepherd over them. Here, more than ever, we have an anticipation of our Lord's teaching in John 10:1-18. He claims to be the Fulfiller, as of the prediction of Isaiah 40:11 and Jeremiah 23:1-3, so also of this. He, the \"Son of David,\" is the David that inherits that among other promises. It has to be noted, however, that Ezekiel's words paint, less distinctly than those of the earlier prophets, the picture of an individual Messianic king, and seem rather to point, as do those of Zechariah 12:10 (I do not now discuss the date of that prophecy), to a line of true rulers, each faithfully representing the ideal David as the faithful Ruler, the true Shepherd of his people (Psalm 78:71; comp. Ezekiel 37:24; Ezekiel 45:8, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I will make with them a servant of peace. The whole verse is an echo of Leviticus 26:6, in part also of Hosea 2:20 [English version, ver. 18]. The words are less definite as to the nature of the covenant than those of Jeremiah 31:31, but probably the same thought underlies both. Sins are pardoned, the capacity for righteousness, righteousness itself, are given. In bright contrast with the picture of a country haunted by the lion, the jackal, and the wolf - the \"evil beasts\" of Ezekiel 14:15 - so that no man could pass through without risk, we have that of a land from which such evil boasts have been cleared out, so that men may sleep safely even in the wilderness and the woods. The language, however, is figurative rather than literal. As the \"sheep\" are the people of the true Israel, so the evil beasts must, at least, include the enemies, Chaldeans, Edomites, Philistines, and others, that had before made havoc of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Round about my hill. Ezekiel's thoughts, like those of Micah 4:1 and Isaiah 2:2, cluster round the hill of Zion, the mountain of Jehovah, as the center of the restored Israel. In that land, as the prophet saw it here, and still more in the closing vision of his book (Ezekiel 47:12), there were, outwardly as well as spiritually, to be showers of blessing (the phrase is peculiar to Ezekiel), and the land should yield its fruits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - When I have broken the bands of their yoke. The underlying meaning of the figurative language of ver. 25 is now utterly explained. Israel is to be delivered from its Chaldean and other oppressors. The \"yoke shall be broken.\" They shall no more be a prey to the heathen. None shall make them afraid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - A plant of renown. The words at first suggest the thought that Ezekiel was reproducing the ideal picture of the \"branch,\" the \"root,\" the \"stem,\" the \"plant.\" of Isaiah 11:1; Jeremiah 23:5; Zechariah 6:12. Here, however, the word is collective, and is translated \"plantation\" in Ezekiel 17:7, \"planting\" in Micah 1:6; Isaiah 60:21; Isaiah 61:3. It can hardly be taken as speaking of more than the general fertility of the land. The rendering of the LXX., \"a plant of peace,\" obviously implies a different reading (shalom instead of shem), and this Cornill has adopted in his text. So taken, the words naturally lead on to what follows - the promise that men should no more be consumed with hunger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel34:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And ye my flock. The great utterance, we might call it the \"ode of the shepherds,\" comes round to the point from which its second portion started (ver. 11). All blessings were summed up in the thought that, behind every representative of the Father's care, the ideal David and his house, there was the eternal relationship between Jehovah and his people, even that of the Shepherd and his sheep. The LXX. omits the words \"are men,\" and here also is followed by Cornill.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.35":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying. As no date is given, the present oracle, extending to the close of Ezekiel 36:15, may be assumed to have been communicated to and delivered by the prophet in immediate succession to the foregoing, with which it has also an intimate connection. Having announced the future restoration of Israel, as Jehovah's flock, to her own land under the leadership of Jehovah's servant David, who should feed them like a shepherd and rule them like a prince (Ezekiel 34:13, 23, 24), the prophet proceeds to contemplate the existing hindrance to this return in the occupation of Palestine by the Edomites, who had probably been allowed by the Chaldeans to take possession of it in payment of services rendered by them against Judah in the siege of Jerusalem - to predict the entire removal of this hindrance. (vers. 1-15), and to administer to Israel the comfort which, as a consequence, would ensue (Ezekiel 36:1-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Set thy face against Mount Seir. The mountainous are in between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf, which formed the original settlement of Esau and his descendants (Genesis 36:9), is here put for the land of Edom, as the land in turn stands for its people (Ezekiel 25:8). Although already the prophet has pronounced a threatening doom against Edom (Ezekiel 25:12-14), he once more directs against, it the judgments of Heaven, on this occasion viewing it as the representative of all those hostile world-powers which from the first had been opposed to Israel as the theocratic nation, and which even then, by their antagonism, hindered her return (cf. Isaiah 63:1-8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against thee (cf. Ezekiel 5:8; Ezekiel 13:8; and contrast Ezekiel 36:9), and I will stretch out mine hand against thee (cf. Ezekiel 6:14; Ezekiel 14:9, 13; Ezekiel 25:7, 19; and Exodus 7:5), and I will make thee most desolate; literally, a desolation and an astonishment (cf. ver. 7). Against the mountains of Israel had been denounced a similar fate, which the idolatrous remnant that lingered in the laud after the Captivity had commenced began to experience (Ezekiel 33:28, 29). The doom, however, connected with the day of Israel's return was to fall upon Edom, whose cities should be emptied of their inhabitants and whose fields should be cursed with barrenness (Ezekiel 25:13; Obadiah 1:8, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They shall know that I am Jehovah. By this expressive formula Ezekiel intimates the moral effect which should be produced upon the nations of the earth, whether by beholding or by experiencing the Divine judgments (Ezekiel 6:7, 13; Ezekiel 7:4, 9; Ezekiel 11:10, 12; Ezekiel 13:9, 14, 21, 23; Ezekiel 14:8; Ezekiel 15:7, et passim; cf. Exodus 6:7; Exodus 7:50 17; 29:46; 31:13; all of which passages belong to Wellhausen's grundschrift, which it is supposed had no existence in the time of Ezekiel).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred; literally, hatred of old, or eternal enmity (cf. Ezekiel 25:15). This was the first of the two specific grounds upon which Eden should feel the stroke of Divine vengeance. Edom had been Israel's hereditary foe from the days of Esau and Jacob (Genesis 25:22, sqq.; and Genesis 27:37) downwards. Inspired with unappeasable wrath (Amos 1:11), during the period of the wandering he had refused Israel, \"his brother,\" a passage through his territory (Numbers 20:14-21; Judges 11:17), and in the days of Jehoshaphat had combined with Ammon and Moab to invade Judah (2 Chronicles 20:10, 11; cf. Psalm 83:1-8). His relentless antipathy to Israel culminated, according to Ezekiel (cf. Obadiah 1:13), in the last days of Jerusalem, in the time of her calamity, when Nebuchadnezzar's armies encompassed her walls, in the time that her iniquity had an end; or, in the time of the iniquity of the end (Revised Version); meaning, according to Keil, \"the time of Judah's final transgression;\" or, according to Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' the time when the capture of the city put an end to her iniquity; but, with more probability, according to Hengstenberg, Plumptre, and others, the time of that iniquity which brought on her end (comp. Ezekiel 21:29). Ewald translates, \"at the time of her extremest punishment,\" taking avon in the sense of punishment - a rendering the Revisers have placed in the margin. Then, according to Obadiah (vers. 11-14), the Edomites had not only stood coolly by, but malevolently exulted when they beheld Jerusalem besieged by the Babylonian warriors; and not only joined with the foreign invaders in the sacking of the city, but occupied its gates and guarded the roads leading into the country, so as to prevent the escape of any of the wretched inhabitants, and even hewed down with the sword such fugitives as they were not able to save alive and deliver up to captivity. To this Ezekiel refers when he accuses Edom of having shed the blood of the children of Israel by the fores of the sword; literally, of having poured the children of Israel upon the hands of the sword; i.e. of having delivered them up to the sword (cf. Psalm 63:11; Jeremiah 18:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will prepare thee unto blood. This peculiar expression was probably selected because of the suggestion of the name Edom (\"red\") contained in the term dam (\"blood\") - though Smend doubts this - and designed to intimate that Edom's name would eventually be verified in Edom's fate. And blood shall pursue thee. \"As blood-guiltiness invariably pursues a murderer, cries for vengeance, and delivers him up to punishment\" (Havernick), so should blood follow in the steps of Edom. The translation of Ewald, who reads מַעַשְׂך instead of אֶעֶשְׂך, \"And because thy inclination is after blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee,\" is hardly an improvement, and is besides unnecessary. Sith thou hast not hated blood. So render Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, Havernick, Schroder, Plumptre, and the Revised Version, meaning that Edom had loved bloodshed. Kimchi, Hitzig, Hengstenberg, Smend, and Fairbairn regard אִמאּלֹא as a particle of strong affirmation, equivalent to \"forsooth,\" \"verily,\" and understand the prophet to say that 'Edom had hated blood. As to the precise import of this rendering, diversity of sentiment prevails. Some, with Theodoret, explain \"blood\" as an allusion to the blood-relationship of Esau and Jacob, Edom and Israel, and hold the charge to be that Edom had hated his \"brother\" Israel. Others, with Hengstenberg, take the blood Edom hated to be the blood he had shed. Hitzig and Fairbairn suppose the sense to be that Edom hated the idea of his own blood being shed. Even - better, therefore (Revised Version) - blood shall pursue thee. A parallel to this expression is supplied by Deuteronomy 28:22, 45. According to the first or commonly accepted exposition of the preceding clause, the sense is that Edom would ultimately fall beneath the great law of retribution, and reap as she had sown - blood for blood; according to the second, the allusion is to the fact that what Edom now most dreaded, the shedding of his own blood, would be that which should ultimately overtake him (cf. Ezekiel 11:8; Job 3:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thus will I make Mount Seir most desolate; literally, desolation and a desolation (שְׁמֲמָּה וּשְׁמָמָה); or, as in the Revised Version, an astonishment and a desolation; changing שְׁמֲמַה into מְשַׁמָּה, for which, however, there is no sufficient warrant. And I will out off... him that passeth out (or, through) and him that returneth. No more should traders or travelers pass through the land of Edom or go to and return from it (cf. Ezekiel 33:28; Zechariah 7:15; 9:8, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And I will fill his mountains with his slain; literally, pierced through; hence mortally wounded. Then Edom's desolation would result from an exterminating war, which should fill its hills, valleys, and rivers, or rather, water-courses, with slaughtered men (cf. Ezekiel 31:12; Ezekiel 32:5). The physical features of Edom here specified by the prophet have often been attested by travelers. \"Idumea embraces a section of a broad mountain range, extending in breadth from the valley of the Arabah to the desert plateau of Arabia. The ravines which intersect these sandstone mountains are very remarkable. Take them as a whole, there is nothing like them in the world, especially those near Petra. The deep valleys and the little terraces along the mountain-sides, and the broad downs upon their summits, are covered with rich soil, in which trees, shrubs, and flowers grow luxuriantly\" (Porter, in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art. \"Idumea\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thy cities shall not return, as in Ezekiel 16:55 (Authorized Version after the Keri); or, shall not be inhabited, as in Ezekiel 26:20; Ezekiel 29:11; Ezekiel 36:33 (LXX. and Revised Version, both of which follow the Chethib). Hengstenberg's translation, \"Thy cities shall not sit,\" but lie prostrate, is not extremely happy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Because thou hast said. The second ground of Edom's punishment lay in this, that she had presumptuously as well as confidently exclaimed, not concerning Idumea and Judah, as Jerome conjectured, but concerning Israel and Judah when she saw them stripped of their inhabitants, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; \"it\" meaning either the region over which the two countries extended, or, as Schroder suggests, Jerusalem their common capital (see Ezekiel 36:2; and comp. Psalm 83:4-12). And what constituted the gravamen of Edom's offense was that she had so spoken, whereas (or, though) the Lord was there. It is not necessary, with the LXX. and Kliefoth, to read \"is there,\" to guard against the supposition that Ezekiel designed to suggest that, though Jehovah had formerly been in the land, he was there no longer. But, in point of fact, Jehovah had for a time withdrawn his visible presence from the temple and the city (see Ezekiel 10:18; Ezekiel 11:22, 23), though he had by no means renounced his right to the land; and Edom's error lay in not regarding this, but in acting as if Jehovah had departed from Israel for ever (Havernick); or (better, \"and\") in thinking he could appropriate to himself what really belonged to Jehovah, viz. the territory out of which Israel and Judah had been cast (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - I will make myself known among them - Israel and Judah; not to thee (LXX., Hitzig, Ewald) - when I have judged thee. Edom's wickedness should be requited by his being made to suffer the indignities he designed to heap on Israel. In him the lextalionis should have full sway. Edom's misconception as to Jehovah's relation to the land and people should be corrected when Jehovah should rise up in judgment against him. Those judgments should in the first instance be a revelation to Israel and Judah, who should discern therefrom that they had not been utterly abandoned by Jehovah (ver. 11; cf. Ezekiel 20:5); and in the second instance should open Edom's eyes to perceive that Jehovah had been a silent listener to all the blasphemies she had uttered against the mountains of Israel (ver. 12), and had reckoned these as blasphemies uttered against himself (ver. 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. By \"the whole earth,\" Fairbairn, Haverniek, and Schroder understand \"the whole land of Edom.\" In this case the sense is that, as the whole land of Edom had previously exulted with joy, so should it in the future be made completely desolate. Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Kliefoth, Smend, and Plumptre, however, more correctly interpret the phrase as signifying the whole human race, with the exception of Edom. Accordingly, the thought seems to be, not that of Ewald and Smend, that Jehovah would make Edom's devastation a sport or comedy (freudespiel) to the whole world; or that of Kliefoth and Hitzig, that God would make Edom desolate, whilst all the earth rejoiced over her downfall; but that of Keil, Plumptre, and others, that just as Jehovah was preparing for the whole earth of redeemed humanity a glorious future of joy, so certainly would Edom and all whom Edom represented be excluded from participation in that joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel35:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - As thou didst rejoice. כִי is here a particle of comparison; and the import of the passage is that precisely as Edom exulted over the desolation of Israel's inheritance, so would Jehovah cause others to rejoice over the downfall and desolation of Edom. All Idumea. Instead of this Greek term, the Revised Version properly substitutes the usual word Edom. Note: That the prediction here uttered concerning Edom received literal fulfillment, the following extract relative to the present state of the country will show: \"Idumea, once so rich in flocks, so strong in its fortresses and rock-hewn cities, so extensive in its commercial relations, so renowned for the architectural splendor of its palaces, is now a deserted and desolate wilderness. Its whole population is contained in some three or four miserable villages. No merchant would now dare to enter its borders; its highways are untrodden, its cities are all in ruins\" (J.L.

Vers. 1-15 belong to the \"word\" which opened with the first verse of the preceding chapter; ver. 16 begins another \"word,\" which only closes at Ezekiel 37:14. The subject of the first part is the comfort offered to Israel in the destruction threatened against the heathen, and in the blessings promised to her land and people. Verse 1. - Prophesy unto the mountains of Israel. This prediction must be read in contrast, first, to that delivered against the mountains of Seir in the last chapter (35.), and, secondly, to that uttered against the mountains of Israel at an earlier stage of Ezekiel's activity (Ezekiel 6.). That \"the mountains of Israel\" was a familiar expression for the land of Israel, see Ezekiel 6:1; Ezekiel 17:22; Ezekiel 33:28; Ezekiel 34:14; Ezekiel 37:22; Ezekiel 38:8; and comp.

The ground of Jehovah's purposed proceeding against Edom and the surrounding heathen peoples (vers. 3, 5) is expressly declared to be the jubilation over the downfall of Israel, and the eagerness with which they sought to appropriate to themselves her forsaken land. Aha! Exulting over Israel's misfortune (comp. Ezekiel 25:3; Psalm 40:16). The ancient high places, which Israel's enemies fancied had become theirs in possession, were probably \"the everlasting hills\" of Genesis 49:26 and Deuteronomy 33:15, the principal mountains of Palestine, which, as Havernick finely observes, were \"the honorable witnesses and indestructible monuments of that ancient blessing spoken by Israel's ancestor, and still resting on the people;\" and to assail which was, in consequence, not only to sin against Jehovah, but to attempt an enterprise foredoomed to failure and shame. At the same time, Plumptre's suggestion ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' Expositor, vol. 8:284; and Unpublished Notes) is not without plausibility, that, considering the special significance of the term bamoth in Ezekiel, the phrase should be held as referring to the sanctuaries which stood upon those heights - including, of course, the chief sanctuary, or temple (Schroder); in support of which the dean cites the frequency with which the enemies of Israel, as, for instance, the Assyrians and the Moabites, in their inscriptions, boasted that they had captured these sanctuaries (see 'Records of the Past,' 2nd series, tel. 1. p. 107; 2:203).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Therefore. Ewald calls attention to the fivefold repetition of this conjunction, saying, \"It repeats itself five times, the reasons [for God's judgments] against these enemies thrusting themselves forward, before the discourse calmly dwells upon the mountains of Israel, of which it is strictly intended to treat.\" As it were, the prophet's emotion is so strong, and his indignation against Israel's enemies so vehement, that, though he three times in succession begins to prophesy to the mountains of Israel, he on each occasion breaks off before he can get his message told, to expatiate upon the wickedness of Israel's foes. In the prophet's estimation that wickedness was so heinous as to inevitably carry in its bosom appropriate retribution. Because - literally, because and because, or even because, a reduplication for the sake of emphasis, as in Ezekiel 13:10 and Leviticus 26:43 - they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side; literally, wasting of and panting after you (are) round about. Fairbairn, Ewald, and Smend, deriving שַׁמות from נָשַׁם, \"to pant,\" rather than from שָׁמַם, \"to lay waste,\" translate, \"because there is snapping and puffing at you round about,\" which Plumptre thinks \"falls in better with the context,\" since \"the prophet's spirit seems to dwell throughout on the derision rather than the desolation to which his country, the mountains of Israel, had been subject.\" And ye are taken up; literally, ye are made to come, if וַתֵּעֲלוּ be an imperf., niph. of עָלַה, \"to go up \"(Rosenmüller, Schroder); or, ye are come, if it be imperf., kal of עָלַל, \"to press, or go in\" (Ewald, Havernick); or, ye are gone up, if it be second pers. kal of עָלַה (Hitzig, Smend). In the lips of talkers; literally, upon the lip of the tongue - the lip being regarded as the instrument or organ with which the tongue speaks. Havernick unnecessarily takes \"the tongue\" as equivalent to \"people\" in the parallel clause - a signification לָשׁון has only in Isaiah 66:18; while Kliefoth views it as synonymous with \"slander,\" as in Psalm 140:11, and translates, \"upon the lip of slander and of the evil report of the people.\" Keil sees in \"the tongue\" a personification for the \"tongue-man\" or talker of Psalm 140:11; and Gesenius considers the two clauses as tautological.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The rivers (or, channels, bottoms, dales) were the water-courses, wadies, or ravines through which mountain streams flowed, as in Ezekiel 35:8; and the residue of the heathen were the surrounding nations that had mocked Israel in her degradation, and were then profiting by her fall (comp. Psalm 79:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Surely. אִם־לא, the particle of adjuration, as in Ezekiel 5:11; Ezekiel 33:27; Ezekiel 34:8; Ezekiel 38:19. The fire of my jealousy. Zephaniah (Zephaniah 1:18; Zephaniah 3:8) uses the same phrase. Similar expressions occur in Ezekiel 21:31, \"the fire of my wrath;\" and Ezekiel 38:19, \"in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath\" (comp. Deuteronomy 4:24). Against all Idumea. Edom. As in Ezekiel 35:15, so here, it is the wickedness, more especially of the Edomites, that excites the prophet's indignation. They had not only concluded that Israel's territory should be to them for a possession, but they had done so with the joy of all their heart, and with despiteful minds; or, with contempt of soul (comp. Ezekiel 25:6, 15); i.e. with deadly (Ewald) or hearty (Smend) contempt. \"The temper of the Edomites,\" writes Plumptre, \"might almost serve as the regulative instance of the form of evil for which Aristotle ('Eth. Nit.,' 2, 7, 15) seems to have coined the word ἐπιχαιρεκακία, the temper which rejoices in the ills that fall on others.\" The concluding clause, to cast it out for a prey, has been differently rendered.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Regarding מִגְרָשָׁהּ as an infinitive after לְמַעַן, \"to spoil it,\" i.e. the land (Gesenius), \"empty out\" (Keil) or \"drive out\" (Ewald, Smend) its inhabitants (so as to get it) for a prey.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Taking מִגְרָשָׁהּ as a noun, \"for the sake of its possession for a prey\" (Kliefoth), that their suburbs should be a prey\" (Hengstenberg) \"on account of its pasturage for a prey\" (Schroder).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Changing לָבַז into לָבֹז, \"in order to plunder its produce\" (Hitzig) or \"pasturage\" (Fairbairn).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTProphesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Because ye have borne the shame of the heathen (i.e. the shame cast upon you by the heathen, see Ezekiel 34:29)... surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame. Not the shame which should be cast upon them by Israel, which would be retaliation, but their own shame - the shame due to them in virtue of the Divine law of retribution (Ezekiel 16:52), their own curses come home to roost, Ezekiel seeming to distinguish between retaliation and retribution. \"The law [of retribution] is demanded by the absolute righteousness of God. The judicial visitations of God cannot possibly be one-sided. Punishment can so much the less strike Israel alone, as precisely in its punishment the deep degradation of heathendom, its apostasy from God and its pride, has set itself forth in the most striking way\" (Havernick). The certainty that this law would operate in the case of the heathen no less than in that of Israel, the prophet expresses by representing Jehovah as having lifted up his hand, or sworn that it should be so (comp. Ezekiel 20:5, 6, 15, 23, 28; Ezekiel 47:14; Exodus 6:8; Numbers 14:30; Deuteronomy 32:40; and Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:195, \"Teaditque ad sidera dextram\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For they are at hand to come. Keil and Plumptre make the subject of the verb the material blessings in which Israel's prosperity is depicted as consisting, viz. the foliage and fruit her mountains were soon to bear for the people of Jehovah. The majority of expositors believe the subject to be the people whose return from exile was in this way declared to be approaching. Nor is there any reason why Ezekiel should not have represented the return from exile as an event soon to take place, since of the seventy years of captivity predicted by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:11) at least twenty years had passed, if its commencement be dated from the fourth year of Jehoiakim (Ezekiel 33:21); and the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise was to the prophet so much a matter of certainty (Ezekiel 11:17) that his fervent imagination conceived it as at hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I am for you. He had previously been against (Ezekiel 5:8; Ezekiel 13:8), but was now for Israel and against Seir (Ezekiel 35:3). This change of dispensation implied no mutation in God, but merely that, as God had previously visited Israel with judgment on account of sin, so henceforth would he visit her with grace on condition of repentance. I will turn unto you. Always it is presupposed that Israel turns unto Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - I will multiply men upon you. Jehovah's promise contemplated a return of both sections of the Golah, the whole house of Israel, Ephraim as well as Judah (comp. Ezekiel 20:40), to the land from which they had been deported, and a restoration of the united kingdom to a condition of prosperity in which its cities should again be inhabited, its ruined homesteads repaired, its fields cultivated, and its flocks and herds multiplied (see Ezekiel 16:55; Isaiah 44:26; Isaiah 54:3; Isaiah 61:4) - a condition of prosperity so great that it should surpass any measure or degree of good fortune previously enjoyed (comp. Deuteronomy 30:5; Job 42:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou shalt devour men no more. From the middle of ver. 12 the form of address changes from the plural to the singular, the whole country, mountains, and valleys being regarded as one land, as in Deuteronomy 3:25. The charge preferred against the country by her enemies was that she had been a land that devoured men and \"bereaved its nations\" (or, \"nation,\" Revised Version); literally, an eater-up of men and a bereaver of thy nations; i.e. of Israel and Judah, perhaps also of the Canaanites, their predecessors (Fausset), the image being that of a wild beast which ravages the population and makes them childless, as in Ezekiel 5:17 and Ezekiel 14:15 (Smend), rather than that of an unnatural mother, a Rabenmutter, as in 2 Kings 6:29, who devours her offspring (Ewald). This charge, in which, perhaps, the prophet detected an allusion to Numbers 13:32, had certainly in times past been true; not, however, as Hengstenberg suggests, because the land had been \"an apple of discord for the Asiatic and African powers,\" or, as Ewald explains, because \"the tremendous restlessness, the excited push and hurry of such a mentally active city must in any case have used up its inhabitants more rapidly;\" but, as Keil, Plumptre, and others interpret, because of the judgments of sword, famine, and pestilence sent upon the land by Jehovah for its sins. These judgments had so destroyed its inhabitants, first the Canaanites, and latterly the two peoples of Israel and Judah, that \"those who looked upon it deemed it a fatal land, which brought destruction to all who should occupy it\" (Currey). In the golden age to which the prophet looked forward, no such reproach should be possible. Not only should the laud not bereave its nations (according to the Keri, followed by the Authorized and Revised Versions, as well as by Ewald and Smend), but (according to the Chethib, preferred by Keil, Kliefoth, Havernick, Heugstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre) it should not even cause them (or it) to stumble; i.e. should no more cause its inhabitants to lapse into those sins, amongst which idolatry stood prominent, which entailed on them ruin. Hengstenberg's idea, that \"moral stumbling is not to be thought of in this connection,\" is certainly to be rejected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Neither will I cause men to hear in thee - let thee hear, proclaim against thee (Revised Version); or literally, cause to be heard against thee - the shame of the heathen any more; i.e. the contemptuous speech uttered against thee by the heathen, equivalent to the reproach of the people; or, peoples; i.e. the reproach cast upon thee by the nations (see Ezekiel 16:57; Ezekiel 22:4; and comp. Joshua 5:9; Micah 6:16), rather than, as Curtsy suggests, the reproach cast upon thee by thy rightful possessors for want of fertility. This prophecy clearly looked beyond the return from exile under Zerubbabel and Joshua, Ezra and Neherajah, since under these leaders only a portion of the whole house of Israel reestablished themselves in Canaan, while the land was often afterwards subjected to reproach and oppression under heathen powers. At the same time, the homecoming from Babylon and the prosperity that ensued thereupon were partial fulfillments of the blessings here promised.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The oracle, commencing with this verse and extending to Ezekiel 37:14, has an ultimate connection with that which precedes. Having predicted a golden age in the future for Israel, when her people should have returned from banishment her cities should again be inhabited and her fields cultivated, the prophet is directedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to explain that the ground of this would not have in any worthiness Jehovah should behold in Israel, who had rather in the past been punished and dispersed (vers. 16-20), but only in the regard he, Jehovah, should have for his own holy Name or character (vers. 21-24);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to intimate that this glorious period should be accompanied by a moral and spiritual renovation of the people, which, however, could and therefore would be brought about only by God himself giving them a new heart and a new spirit, again for his own Name's sake (vers. 25-32), and which, when attained, should lead to a prosperity so unparalleled as to recall the pristine splendors of earth's paradisiacal condition, and convince the heathen that should then be sharers in Israel's felicity that Jehovah alone was God (vers. 33-38); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) to remove all doubt from the people's minds as to the possibility of this happening by the vision of the dry bones (Ezekiel 37:1-14). Verses 16-20. - That Israel's restoration should not be brought about on account of Israel's merit, the prophet shows by briefly rehearsing the story of Israel's demerit, as the reason of her exile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Their way was before me. Their ways and doings, i.e. their violent deeds and idolatrous practices (ver. 18), were as morally loathsome in Jehovah's sight as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation was materially disgusting. The comparison may have been derived from Isaiah 64:6, but was as likely to have been original, seeing Ezekiel was a priest-prophet, to whom the details of the Levitical Law must have been familiar (comp. Ezekiel 18:6; Leviticus 15:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - According to their way and according to their doings I judged them. The language hints at a correspondence between the punishment and the crime. As a woman in her separation was not only defiled, but separated from the congregation Leviticus 15:19), so Israel, having defiled both herself and her land, required to be removed from it (Leviticus 18:28). And she was. Jehovah scattered her among the heathen and dispersed her through the countries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They profaned my holy Name; or, the name of my holiness. According to Kliefoth, the subject of the verb is \"the heathen,\" but expositors generally regard it as \"the house of Israel\" of ver. 17. Plumptre thinks that \"while grammatically the words may refer to either the heathen or the exiles of Israel, possibly the sentence was purposely left vague, so as to describe the fact in which both were sharers,\" and cites in support of this view similar constructions in Isaiah 55:5 and Romans 2:24. What led to the profanation of Jehovah's Name by the heathen was the arrival among them, not of the news of the calamity which had befallen Israel (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg), but of the house of Israel itself; and the actual profanation lay in this, that, having beheld the exiles, they said, These are the people of the Lord, and they are gone forth out of his land. As the heathen recognized only local divinities, they concluded Jehovah had either behaved capriciously towards his people and east them off (comp. Jeremiah 23:40; Jeremiah 29:18; Jeremiah 33:24), or had proved unequal to the task of protecting them so that they had been driven off (comp. Ezekiel 20:5, etc.; Numbers 14:16; Jeremiah 14:9). In either case, the honor of Jehovah had been lessened in the minds and tarnished by the words of the heathen, and inasmuch as this result had been brought about by Israel's sin, on Israel properly the blame lay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I had pity for mille holy Name. Havernick, after the LXX., wrongly renders, \"I spared (them, i.e. Israel) for my holy Name s sake; but the preposition for or \"upon\" following the verb usually marks the object upon which the action of the verb terminates (see Ezekiel 16:5). Gesenius translates, \"I will be sparing of my holy Name;\" i.e. I will care for its honor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Not for your sakes... but for mine holy Name's sake. Thus Jehovah repudiates the claim of merit on Israel's part (comp. ver. 32); and if Israel had no claim on Jehovah for deliverance from the Babylonish exile any more than she had at first to be put in possession of Canaan (Deuteronomy 9:6), much less has fallen man a claim on God for salvation from the condemnation and dominion of sin (Romans 11:6; Ephesians 2:8-10). As the essential holiness and righteousness of God were the real reason of Israel's exile and dispersion among the nations, so were these qualities in God the ultimate grounds to which Israel's recovery and restoration should be traced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I will sanctify my great Name; i.e. the name of my holiness (Deuteronomy 28:58; Psalm 8:1; Malachi 1:11). As Israel's dispersion had caused that Name to be profaned, so Israel's restoration would secure that it should be magnified among the heathen (Ezekiel 38:23), who should learn from this event that their previous ideas of Jehovah, as a feeble and local divinity, had been wrong. The question whether your eyes, as in the Hebrew text, or \"their eyes,\" as in many ancient versions, should be read is debated. The latter reading appears to be demanded by the usus loquendi of Ezekiel (see Ezekiel 20:41; Ezekiel 28:25; Ezekiel 38:16; Ezekiel 39:27), and is adopted by both English versions as well as by interpreters of eminence; but other expositors of equal name adhere to the former reading on the ground that the sanctifying of Jehovah's Name in the eyes of Israel was an indispensable preliminary to its sanctification in the eyes of the heathen. Havernick regards \"their eyes\" as \"an obvious emendation to relieve a difficulty,\" to which in no case should criticism accord the preference; while Keil gives it the preference, though admitting that \"your eyes\" can be justified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I will take you from among the heathen; or, nations. The first step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name. A promise already given (Ezekiel 11:17; Ezekiel 20:41, 42), and afterwards repeated (Ezekiel 37:21). The mention of \"all countries\" shows the prophet's gaze to have been directed beyond the present or immediate future. The Israel of Ezekiel's time had not been scattered among and could not be gathered from all, countries; yet in the years that have passed since then Ezekiel's language as to Israel's dispersion has been literally fulfilled. Wherefore the inference is reasonable that the reassembling to which Ezekiel refers is an event that has not yet occurred, at least in its fullest measure and degree, but will only then be realized completely and finally when the scattered members of the house of Israel shall have been received into the Christian Church (Romans 11:25, 26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Then (literally, and) I will sprinkle clean water upon you. The second step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name, and one absolutely necessary to render the preceding either permanent or valuable, was the moral renovation of the people; and in this the first stage was the forgiveness of the people's sins. The image under which this is set forth, \"sprinkling with clean water,\" would naturally present itself to a priest-prophet such as Ezekiel. Jarchi, Rosenmüller, Hengstenberg, and others suppose the allusion to be to the water of purification prepared by mixing running water with the ashes of a red heifer (Numbers 19:17-19), and in the account given of this rite the verb for \"sprinkle\" is that used by Ezekiel, viz. זָרַק. Havernick prefers the rite performed in the consecration of the Levites (Numbers 8:7, 21). Smend, who holds the priest-code had no existence in Ezekiel's day, traces the image to Zechariah 13:1 or Psalm 51:2, though he also cites Numbers 8:19. Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Currey think of the lustrations of the Law in general; and perhaps this best explains the prophet's language, since the element sprinkled is not \"blood\" or \"water mixed with ashes,\" but \"clean water,\" \"the best known means of purification\" (Schroder). As to whether legal or moral cleansing were intended by the prophet, possibly Ezekiel drew no sharp distinction between the two, such as the New Testament draws between justification and sanctification; if he did, then the figure in the text must be taken as alluding rather to the former than to the latter - rather to the forgiveness of Israel's sin than to the regeneration of Israel's heart, which is next referred to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you. The third step in the progress of sanctifying Jehovah's Name (comp. Ezekiel 11:19, where a similar promise is made, and Ezekiel 18:31, where the new heart is represented as a thing Israel must make for herself). This antinomy frequently occurs in Scripture, which never shrinks from holding man responsible for the production of that, as e.g. faith, for which he is incompetent without the help of Divine grace. Besides the cleansing of her guilt and her restitution in consequence to Jehovah's favor, Israel is promised such an inward renovation of her moral and spiritual disposition as to secure that she shall in future adhere to the worship and service of Jehovah. This change is described in a fourfold way.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Negatively, as a removal of the old, stony, unsusceptible heart, which had remained impervious to all appeals and insertsible to all higher feelings (Zechariah 7:12).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Positively, as a new heart and a new spirit, called elsewhere \"one heart\" and \"a heart of flesh\" (Ezekiel 11:19; Jeremiah 32:39), \"a heart to know God\" (Jeremiah 24:7).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Causally, its existence being traced to the indwelling of God's Spirit, who writes God's Law upon the new heart, and inclines it to a life of obedience thereto (Jeremiah 31:33).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Practically, by its manifestation, walking in God's statutes and keeping God s judgments (Ezekiel 11:20). The account here furnished of the moral and spiritual change proposed to be inwrought on Israel cot-responds exactly with that given in the New Testament of the regeneration of the individual soul (John 3:3-8; Romans 8:2, 5, 9; Galatians 5:22; Titus 3:5, 6; 1 Peter 1:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-31 describe the results which should follow in Israel's experience when God should have thus gathered, cleansed, and renewed them. They should then haveNEWLINENEWLINE(1) permanent occupation of the land (ver. 28);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) covenant relationship with God as his people (ver. 28);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) protection against future lapsing into idolatry and immorality (ver. 29);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) abundant supply for every want (vers. 29, 30); andNEWLINENEWLINE(5) a deepening sense of self-humiliation on account of and repentance for past sin (ver. 31). Ver. 28. - Ye shall dwell in the land. As the Jews who returned from Babylon did not permanently dwell in the land, but were again ejected from it, the promise contained in these words must be viewed as having been conditional on the realization of the moral and spiritual purity above described. If, therefore, it be aroused that inasmuch as this promise must be fulfilled (2 Corinthians 1:20; Hebrews 10:23), the Jews must yet be restored to Palestine, the reply is that their return can only take place when they have been converted to Christianity; so that the whole promise must be regarded as receiving its highest fulfillment in the experiences of the Church of Christ. That this view is correct is vouched for by the fact that the words, Ye shall be my people and I will be your God (comp. Ezekiel 11:20: Jeremiah 7:23; Jeremiah 11:4; Jeremiah 30:22), descriptive of the covenant relationship in which Jehovah stood towards Israel (Exodus 19:5; Leviticus 26:12; Deuteronomy 26:17, 18), have been chosen by New Testament writers to set forth the relationship of God towards the Christian Church, first here on earth (2 Corinthians 6:16-18), and afterwards in the heavenly Jerusalem (Revelation 21:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - From all your uncleannesses.

From their uncleanness of the past they have already been saved (ver. 25); the present promise guarantees preservation against future lapsing into uncleanness, i.e. the filthiness of idol-service. \"With this,\" writes Plumptre, \"the necessity for temporal chastisements as a corrective discipline should cease, and there would be nothing to check the full outpouring of all material as well as spiritual blessings.\" With the phrase, I will call for the corn, compare the similar expressions in 2 Kings 8:1; Hosea 2:23, etc.; Jeremiah 31:12; Zechariah 9:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight (comp. Ezekiel 16:61; Ezekiel 42:10). The last result of this enlarged experience of the Divine goodness would be to quicken in the heart of forgiven and renewed Israel a sense of shame and a feeling of repentance (comp. Romans 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32 repeats and emphasizes the thought of ver. 22, that the true ground of God's gracious dealing with Israel should be found, not in their merit, but in his grace. So far as their ways were concerned, there was cause only for judgment on his part and self-humiliation on theirs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-36 describe the effect of Israel's restored prosperity on the surrounding nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden. (For the reverse picture, see Joel 2:3.) The thought of the first Paradise (Genesis 2:8), in the historicity of which clearly Ezekiel believed, was one on which his mind often dwelt (Ezekiel 28:13; Ezekiel 31:9) as an ideal of earthly beauty and fertility which should recur in the closing age of the world - a hope which appears to have been shared by Isaiah (Isaiah 51:3), and taken up by John (Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:1-3). In the day when that hope should be realized for Israel, the waste, desolate, and ruined cities, on which the passers-by who visited Palestine gazed, should be fenced and inhabited; literally, inhabited as fortresses. The three predicates, \"waste,\" \"desolate,\" and\" ruined,\" have been distinguished as signifying \"stripped of its inhabitants,\" \"untilled in its lands,\" and \"broken down in its buildings;\" in contrast with which, in the golden era of the future, the towns should be inhabited, the fields tilled, and the ruined fortresses built.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The heathen that are left round about you. The language presupposes that at or before the time of Israel's restoration the judgments pronounced against the nations will have overtaken them, so that only a remnant of them will be then in existence. Kliefoth and Currey view this remnant as those who shall have been converted out of heathendom and become attached to the community of Israel, like \"the nations of the saved\" in Revelation 21:24; Keil, with more accuracy, regards their conversion as resulting from their recognition of the hand of God in building again the wastes places of Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel. On two previous occasions (Ezekiel 14:3; Ezekiel 20:3), Jehovah had declined to be inquired of by the hypocritical and idol-loving elders of Israel, who pretended to consult him through his prophet; now he makes it known that in the future era no barrier of moral and spiritual unfitness on their part will prevent their free approach to his throne, but rather that they will come to him with fervent supplications for the very blessings he has pro-raised. In answer to their prayers, he engages, going back to the language of Ezekiel 34:22, to increase them with men like a flock - incorrectly rendered by Kliefoth to \"multiply them so that they shall become the flock of mankind.\" Thus he meets the despondency of those among the exiles who, fixing their attention on the small number of them who should form the new Israel - those who should return with those, perhaps, who still remained in the land-could not see how Israel's future prosperity was to be secured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel36:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - The people who should occupy the land of Israel in the coming age should be as the holy flock - literally, as the flock of holy things, or beasts; i.e. of sacrificial lambs - as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; literally, in her appointed times; i.e. her festal seasons (comp. Micah 2:12), referring to the three well-known annual occasions when the male population of the land came to the sanctuary (Deuteronomy 16:16), and when in consequence the flocks and herds poured into the metropolis were well-nigh past reckoning (see 2 Chronicles 29:33; 2 Chronicles 35:7; and comp. Josephus, 'Wars,' 6:9. 3). Perhaps in addition to the idea of the multiplication of the people, that of their dedication to the service of Jehovah is suggested by the prophet's language.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.37":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The hand of the Lord was upon me. The absence of the customary \"and\" (comp. Ezekiel 1:1, 3; Ezekiel 3:14, 22), wanting only once again (Ezekiel 40:1), appears to indicate something extraordinary and unusual in the prophet's experience. In the words of Ewald, such a never-beheld sight one sees freely (by itself) in a moment of higher inspiration or never;\" and that in this whole vision the prophet was the subject of a special and intensified inspiration is evident, not alone from the contents of the vision, but also from the language in which it is recorded. And carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord. So the Vulgate and Hitzig - a translation which Smend thinks might be justified by an appeal to Ezekiel 11:24, in which the similar phrase, \"Spirit of God (Elohim),\" occurs; though, with Grotius, Havernick, Keil, and others, he prefers the rendering of the LXX., \"And Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit.\" The Revised Version combines the two thus: \"And he carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord.\" Keil suggests that the words, \"of God,\" in Ezekiel 11:24, were omitted here because of the word \"Jehovah\" immediately following. And set me down in the midst of the valley. As the article indicates, the valley in the neighborhood of Tel-Abib, where the prophet received his first instructions concerning his mission (Ezekiel 3:22); although Hengstenberg holds, wrongly we think, that \"the valley here has nothing to do with the valley in Ezekiel 3:22.\" Which (literally, and it) was full of bones; i.e. of men who had been slaughtered there (ver. 9; comp. Ezekiel 39:11), and whose corpses had been left unburied upon the face of the plain (ver. 3), so that they were seen by the prophet. Whether these bones were actually in the valley, or merely formed part of the vision, can only be conjectured, though the latter opinion seems the more probable. At the same time, such a plain as is here depicted may well have been a battle-ground on which Assyrian and Chaldean armies had often met.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And he caused me to pass by them round about. Not over, as Keil, Klie-foth, and Plumptre translate, but round about them, so as to view them from every side. The result of the prophet's inspection of the bones was to excite within him a feeling of surprise which expressed itself in a twofold behold; the first occasioned by a contemplation of their number, very many, and their situation, in the open valley, literally, upon the face of the valley; i.e. not underground, where they could not have been seen, but upon the surface of the soil, and not piled up in heaps, but scattered over the ground; and the second by a discernment of their condition as very dry, so bleached and withered as to foreclose, not the possibility alone, but also the thought of their resuscitation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Son of man, can these bones live? Whether or not this question was directed, as Plumptre surmises, to meet despairing thoughts which had arisen in the prophet's own mind, it seems reasonable to hold, with Havernick, that the question was addressed to him as representing \"ever against God the people, and certainly as to this point the natural and purely human consciousness of the same,\" to which Israel's restoration appeared as unlikely an occurrence as the reanimation of the withered bones that lay around. The extreme improbability, if not absolute impossibility, of the occurrence, at least to human reason and power, is perhaps pointed at in the designation \"Son of man\" here given to the prophet. The prophet's answer, O Lord God, thou knowest, is not to be interpreted as proving that to the prophet hitherto the thought of a resurrection had been unfamiliar, if not completely absent, or as giving a direct reply either affirmative or negative to the question proposed to him, but merely as expressing the prophet's sense of the greatness of the wonder suggested to his mind, with perhaps a latent acknowledgment that God alone had the power by which such a wonder could, and therefore alone also the knowledge whether it would, be accomplished (comp. Revelation 7:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Prophesy upon (or, over) then bones. This instruction - which shows Jehovah regarded the prophet's answer as equivalent to an admission that the revivification of the bones lay within his (Jehovah's) power - was not a mere command to predict, as in Ezekiel 6:2 and Ezekiel 11:4, but an injunction to utter the Divine word through which the miracle (of creation, as it really was) should be performed. \"The significance of the command lies in the fact that it taught the prophet that he was himself to be instrumental in the great work of resuscitation. He who had been so often troubled with the sense of impotence and failure, who had heard the people say of him, 'Both he not speak parables?' who had been to them as the lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and nothing more than that, was at last to learn that the word of the Lord,' spoken by his lips, was mighty, and would not return to him void\" (Plumptre).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I will cause breath to eater into you; literally, I am causing breath (or, spirit) to enter into you. The real agent, therefore, in the resuscitation of the bones was to be, not the prophet or the word, but Jehovah himself; and that the end aimed at by the Divine activity was \"life\" shows the breath spoken of (ruach) was not to be the wind, as in ver. 9, or the Spirit, but the breath of life, as in Genesis 6:17 and Genesis 7:22 (comp. Genesis 2:7; Psalm 104:30; Isaiah 26:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The process of revivification is now divided into two stages - a preliminary stage which should effect the reconstruction of the external skeleton, by bringing together its different parts and clothing them with sinews, flesh, and skin (comp. Job 10:11); and a finishing stage, which should consist in animating, or \"putting breath in\" the reconstructed skeleton; corresponding so the two stages into which the process of man's original creation was divided (Genesis 2:7). The result would be that the resurrected and reanimated bones, like newly made man, would know the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - So I prophesied as I was commanded. The words uttered were without doubt those of vers. 4-6. The effect produced is depicted in its various steps. First, there resulted a noise - literally, a voice - which the Revisers take to have been \"a thundering;\" and Havernick, Keil, Smend, and others, \"a sound\" in general; but which Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, with more propriety, regard as having been an audible voice, if not, as Kliefoth supposes, the trumpet-blast or \"voice of God,\" which, according to certain New Testament passages, shall precede the resurrection and awaken the dead (John 5:25, 28; 1 Corinthians 15:52; 1 Thessalonians 4:16); perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, the \"counterpart\" thereof. Next, a shaking, σεισμὸς (LXX.); which the Revisers, following Klie-foth, understand to have been an earthquake, as in 1 Kings 19:11; Amos 1:1; Zechariah 1:1; Zechariah 14:5 (comp. Matthew 27:51), and Ewald explains as \"a peal of thunder running through the entire announcement,\" as in Ezekiel 3:12, 13 and Ezekiel 38:19, 20; but which is better interpreted by Keil, Smend, and others as a rustling proceeding from a movement among the bones. Thirdly, the bones came together in the body as a whole, and in particular bone to his bone; i.e. each bone to the bone with which it was designed to be united, as e.g. \"the upper to the lower part of the arm\" (Schroder). Lastly, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above; or, as in the Revised Version, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up and skin covered them above; precisely as Jehovah had announced to the prophet would take place (ver. 6). Yet, though the external framework of the bodies was finished, there was no breath in them - ruach having still the same import as in ver. 5. With this the preliminary stage in the reanimating process terminated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The finishing stage began by the prophet receiving a command to prophesy unto the wind (better, breath, or spirit), and to summon it from the four \"breaths,\" or \"winds\" (in this case the preferable rendering), that it might breathe upon the slain. \"Four winds\" are mentioned, as in Ezekiel 40:20, to indicate the four quarters of heaven (comp. Ezekiel 5:10, 12; Ezekiel 12:14; Ezekiel 17:21), and perhaps also to suggest the immense quantity of vitalizing force demanded by the multitude of the dead (Smend), \"the fullness and force of the Spirit's operations\" (Hengstenberg), or the notion that the Spirit, in resuscitating Israel, would make use of all the varied forces that were then working in the world (Plumptre). The designation of the dead as slain reveals that the resurrection intended was not that of men in general, but of the nation of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - An exceeding great army. This harmonizes with the feature in the vision which describes the bones as those of slain men, while also it may be viewed as foreshadowing the future destiny of Israel. \"The bones of the slain on the field of battle, having been brought together, clothed with flesh, and a new life breathed into them, now they stand up, not as 'a mixed multitude,' but as 'an exceeding great army' prepared to take their part in the wars of Jehovah under new and happier conditions\" (Plumptre). (On the phrase, \"to stand upon the feet,\" comp. Ezekiel 2:1; Zechariah 14:12; Revelation 11:11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-14 contain, according to most commentators, the Divine interpretation of the vision, Kliefoth alone contending that they furnish, not so much an exposition of the vision - which, he thinks, must be explained independently, and which he regards as teaching the future resurrection of God's people - as an application to Israel's ease of the doctrine contained in the vision. Verse 11. - These bones are the whole house of Israel. On the principle that \"God is his own best interpreter,\" it should not be difficult to see that, whatever foreshadowings of the final resurrection of the just may be contained in the vision, its primary intention was to depict the political and national restoration of Israel (Ephraim and Judah) whose condition at the time the field of withered bones appropriately represented. That Hitzig errs in supposing the \"bones\" alluded to in this verse symbolized the portions of Ephraim and Judah then dead, instead of the portions still living (in exile), who considered themselves as practically dead, is apparent from the words that follow. Behold, they say. The complaint was manifestly taken from the popular sayings current among the people of the exile. Broken up, dispersed, expatriated, and despairing, the members of what had once been \"the whole house of Israel\" felt there was no hope more of recovering national life and unity. The cheerless character of the outlook they expressed by saying, Our bones (not the bones of the dead, but of the living) are dried - meaning, \"The vital force of our nation is gone\" (the bones being regarded in Scripture as the seat of the vital force comp. Psalm 32:3) - our hope is lost - our hope, i.e., of ever again returning to our own land or regaining national existence - and we are out off for our parts; literally, we are cut off for ourselves; which Gesenius explains to mean, \"We are lost,\" taking סעךתתסאנוךלפ סעשׁלתאד א סא לָנוּ; Hitzig, \"We are reduced to ourselves;\" Delitzsch and Keil, \"We are cut off from the land of the living,\" i.e. it is all over with us; Hengstenberg, \"We are cut off - a sad fact for us;\" Revised Version, \"We are clean cut off;\" any one of which renders the force of the words (scrap. Lamentations 3:54).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - I will open your graves. That this is not exact interpretation of the foregoing symbol may be argued from the fact that in the vision no mention is made of graves; yet the discrepancy to which it is supposed to point is more apparent than real. If the prophet was to see the bones, it was requisite that these should be above ground rather than beneath. On the other hand, when one speaks of a grave, it is not needful to always think of an underground tomb. To all intents and purposes a person is in his grave when, life being extinct, his body has returned to the dust. So, the opening of graves promised in Scripture is not so much, or always, the cleaving asunder of material sepulchers, as the bringing back to life of those whose bodies have returned to the dust. Hence the opening of Israel's graves could only signify the reawakening of the politically and religiously dead people to national and spiritual life. This was the first step in the restoration of the future held up before the minds of the despairing people. The second, indicated by the clause, and allah put my Spirit in you, pointed, as in Ezekiel 36:26, 27, to their future endowment with higher moral and spiritual life than they had previously possessed, and not merely, as in vers. 5, 6, to their political and national resuscitation (Smend). The last step, the re-establishment of the reconstructed nation in Palestine, was guaranteed by the word, I will place you in your own land. The circumstance that this is twice repeated (vers. 12, 14) shows that whatever view be entertained of the ultimate occupation of Canaan by Israel, this was the goal towards which the vision looked. That it received partial, limited, and temporary fulfillment of a literal kind in the restoration under Zerubbabel and Ezra, is undeniable; that it will ever obtain historical realization of a permanent sort is doubtful; that it will eventually find its highest significance when God's spiritual Israel, the Church of Christ, takes possession of the heavenly Canaan, is one of the clearest and surest announcements of Scripture. NOTE. - On the above nine verses (6-14) Plumptre writes, \"We can scarcely fail to find, in our Lord's words in John 5, something like an echo of Ezekiel's teaching. There also, though the truth of the general resurrection is declared more clearly, the primary thought is that of a spiritual resurrection. Further, we may note that the complement of Ezekiel's message is found in the language of Daniel 12:2. Taking the two together, we find both reproduced in the teaching of John 5.\" (manuscript notes).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-28. - The \"word\" embodied in this section was probably communicated to the prophet at the close of the preceding vision. Its connection with this is apparent, treating as it does of the union of the then severed branches of the house of Israel, and of the subsequent prosperity which should attend united Israel under the rule of the Messianic King of the future. That this oracle, like the former, had only a temporary and partial accomplishment in the return from captivity is so obvious as to stand in no need of demonstration. Its true fulfillment must be sought in the future ingathering of Israel to the Christian Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Take thee one stick, and write. The symbolic action thus prescribed to the prophet was manifestly based on the well-known historical fact that the tribes of Israel, in Mosaic times, had been represented by a rod, on which was inscribed the name of the tribe (Numbers 17:2); but whether the stick Ezekiel was instructed to take was a staff, ῤάβδος (LXX., Hirernick, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Smend), or a block (Ewald), or simply a piece (Keil, Schroder) of wood on which a few words might be traced, cannot be decided. On the first stick the prophet was directed to write, For Judah, and the house of his companions; i.e. for the southern kingdom and those of the northern tribes who adhered to it, as e.g., Benjamin, Levi, and part of Simeon, with those devout Jehovah-worshippers who from time to time emigrated from other tribes and settled in the land of Judah (2 Chronicles 11:12-16; 2 Chronicles 15:9; 2 Chronicles 30:11, 18, 31; 31:1; though by Wellhausen, Smend, and others, such passages are pronounced unhistorical). On the second stick also the prophet was directed to write; but whether For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for (or, of) all the house of Israel his companions (Authorized and Revised Versions), or \"For Joseph and the whole house of Israel\" (Keil), or simply \"For Joseph\" (Ewald, Havernick, Smend), cannot be determined. Each interpretation can be supported by quite reasonable considerations. For the first may be pleaded that it best accords with the natural sense of the text; for the second, that the phrase, the stick of Ephraim, appears to be explanatory of and in opposition to \"For Joseph;\" for the third, that all the house of Israel stands, like \"Ephraim,\" under the regimen of \"stick.\" The introduction of Joseph as the representative of the northern kingdom rests, not on the fact that Joseph's was the most honorable name among the ten tribes (Havernick), but on the circumstance that the tribe of Joseph, as represented by Ephraim and Manasseh, constituted the main body of the northern kingdom. The addition of Ephraim's name is best accounted for by remembering that in his hand lay the hegemony of the kingdom. \"All the house of Israel his companions\" signified the rest of the ten tribes. That the two sticks, when joined together in the prophet's hand, were to become one cannot signify that they were then and there to be miraculously united.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these? literally, what these (two pieces of wood) are to thee. The suggestion that such a request would be preferred to Ezekiel makes it clear he was meant to perform the symbolic action in public. That his countrymen should fail to understand this action accorded with their proverbial dullness of apprehension (comp. Ezekiel 12:9; Ezekiel 24:19). In explanation, the prophet was enjoined to say unto them, while holding the sticks in his hand, that just as he had made the sticks one in his hand, so would God make one in his hand the two kingdoms symbolized by the sticks. The union of the sticks was to be Ezekiel's work (ver. 17, \"in thy hand\"); the union of the kingdoms should be Jehovah's (ver. 19, \"in my hand\"). The separation of the kingdoms had been Ephraim's doing (\"in the hand of Ephraim\"); their combination should be God's (\"in my hand\"). Their severance had been effected, on the part of Ephraim, by an unlawful breaking off from the house of Judah, and the establishment of an independent kingdom; their unification should be brought about by the putting down of Ephraim, and the confirming of the crown rights of Judah. The translation, And will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, signifying \"And will put the tribes of Israel with him.\" i.e. the tribe of Judah, supported by the LXX., and preferred by Ewald, Smend, and others, is superior to that of the Revised Version margin, \"And will put them together with it, unto [or, ' to be'] the stick of Judah.\" Keil s rendering, \"I will take the stick of Joseph... and the tribes of Israel his companions, which I put thereon [literally, 'and I put them,' viz. the tribes, 'upon it,' i.e. the stick of Joseph] with the stick of Judah,\" is too involved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-28 explain how the unification of the two kingdoms should be brought about. The first step should be the bringing of the people home to their own land (vers. 21, 22); the second, their purification from idolatry (ver. 23); the third, the installation over them, thus united and purified, of one King, the ideal David of the future, or the Messiah (vers. 24, 25); the fourth, the establishment with them of Jehovah's covenant of peace (ver. 26), and the permanent erection amongst them of Jehovah's temple (vers. 27, 28). Verses 21, 22. - I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen. That tills promise was intended to find an initial and partial fulfillment in the return from Babylon is undoubted. That it was also designed to look across the centuries towards the final ingathering of God's spiritual Israel into their permanent inheritance, the heavenly Canaan, an examination of its terms shows. These clearly presuppose a wider dispersion of Israel than had then, i.e. in Ezekiel's day, taken place; and that Israel has never yet been made one nation upon the mountains of Israel, is incontestable. Nor is there ground for expecting she ever will be. Not even after the exile closed did all Israel return to Palestine. Nor did it ever come true in their experience that one king was king to them all, since, in point of fact, they never afterwards had an earthly sore-reign at all who was properly independent. If, therefore, the prince who in the future should shepherd them was not to be a temporal monarch, but the Messiah, the probability is that the Israel he should shepherd was designed to be, not Israel after the flesh, but Israel after the spirit, who should walk in his judgments and observe his statutes, and who, in the fullness of the times, should develop out into the Christian Church. Hence it seems reasonable to conclude that their own land, into which they should eventually be brought, would be not so much the veritable soil from which their ancestors had been expelled, as the country or region in which the new, rejuvenated, reunited, and reformed Israel should dwell, which, again, should be n territory cleansed from sin and idolatry, so as to render it a fit abode for a people devoted to righteousness. Viewed in this light, their own land was first Canaan, in so far as after the exile it was cleansed from idolatry; now it is those portions of the earth in which the Christian Church has been planted, so far as these are influenced by the holy principles of religion; finally, it will be the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness (scrap. Ezekiel 34:24; Ezekiel 36:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The dwelling-places wherein they have sinned, from which Jehovah premises to save them, are in accordance with the views expressed above, not, as Hengstenberg and Hitzig conjecture, the dwelling-places of the exile in which the people then were, but the dwelling-places in Canaan in which they had formerly transgressed, but would in future be preserved from transgressing. The idea is, as Schroder suggests, the localization of transgression which is viewed as proceeding from the dwelling-places in which it is committed; or, according to Plumptre, the conception is that, as their habitations had formerly been contaminated by their detestable things, \"the worship of teraphim and such like, if not worse,\" so Jehovah would save them from that contamination. The proposal to alter the text by the transposition of a letter, converting moshbhothehem, \"dwelling-places,\" into meshubhothehem,\" defections,\" as in Jeremiah 3:22 (comp. Ezekiel 36:29), though adopted by some ancient versions and favored by Ewald and Smend, is not necessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The phrase, my servant David (comp. Ezekiel 34:23, 24; Jeremiah 33:21, 22, 26; Psalm 78:70; Psalm 89:3, 20; Psalm 144:10), goes back to the Messianic promise of 2 Samuel 7:12-16, and cannot be satisfactorily explained as signifying the Davidic house (Smend), or as pointing to \"a line of true rulers, each faithfully representing the ideal David as the faithful Ruler, the true Shepherd of his people\" (Plumptre, on Ezekiel 34:23), inasmuch as Israel, after Ezekiel's day, never possessed any such line of rulers, and certainly no such line continued forever. The only feasible exegesis is that which understands Jehovah's servant David to be Messiah, or Jesus Christ, of whom the writer to the Hebrews (Hebrews 1:8) says. \"Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - With the people thus gathered (ver. 21), united (ver. 22), purified (ver. 23), and established under the rule of Messiah (ver. 25), Jehovah makes a covenant of peace (see on Ezekiel 34:25; and comp. Psalm 89:3), further characterized as an everlasting covenant; or, covenant of eternity (see on Ezekiel 16:60; and comp. Genesis 17:7; Isaiah 55:3; Jeremiah 32:40); which guarantees the continuance between him and them of undying friendship, conjoined with the bestowment on his part and the enjoyment on theirs of the highest social and religious blessings. First, national existence and secure possession of the soil. I will place (literally, give) them, either to their land, as in Ezekiel 17:22 (Smend), or to be a nation (Keil), or perhaps both (Kliefoth). Next, steady increase of population - I will multiply them (comp. Ezekiel 36:37; Leviticus 26:9). Thirdly, perpetual residence of Jehovah amongst them, I will set (or, give) my sanctuary (mikdashi, conveying the idea of sanctity) in the midst of them for evermore (scrap. Leviticus 26:11); my tabernacle (mishkani, the idea being that of residence or dwelling) also shall be with them; or, over them - the figure being derived from the elevated site of the temple, which overhung the city (Psalm 69:29), and intended to suggest the idea of Jehovah's protecting grace. That this promise was in part implemented by the erection of the second temple in the days of Zerubbabel may be conceded, and also that Ezekiel himself may have looked forward to a literal restoration of the sanctuary; but its highest realization must be sought for, first in the Incarnation (John 1:14), next in God's inhabitation of the Church through the Spirit (2 Corinthians 6:16), and finally in his tabernacling with redeemed men in the heavenly Jerusalem (Revelation 21:3, 22). The last blessing specified is the intimate communion of God with his people, and of them with him - Yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people. This, which formed the kernel of the old covenant with Israel (Leviticus 26:12), became the essence of the new covenant with the Israel of the restoration (Ezekiel 11:20; Ezekiel 36:28; Jeremiah 30:22; Jeremiah 31:33; Jeremiah 32:38; Zechariah 8:8; Zechariah 13:9), but only attained to complete realization in the relation of Christian believers to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 6:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel37:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28 describes the effect which such a glorious transformation of Israel's character and condition, should produce upon the heathen world. They should recognize from his presence amongst his people, symbolized by the establishment in their midst of his sanctuary, that he had both the power and the will to sanctify them, by making them inwardly as well as outwardly holy; and, recognizing this, they would seek admittance to the congregation and fellowship of God's spiritual Israel.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.38":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-13. - The announcement of Cog's expedition against Israel. Verse 1. - The word of the Lord came unto me. Although this oracle is unaccompanied by any note of time, it was obviously delivered before the twenty-fifth year of the Captivity (Ezekiel 40:1), and most likely in immediate succession to the preceding prophecy, with which also it has a close relation in respect of purport, being designed to show that against restored and united Israel, i.e. against the Church of God of the future, the strongest combinations of hostile force would not prevail, but would fall back defeated and self-destroyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Set thy face against (or, toward) God. Although occurring in 1 Chronicles 5:4 as the name of a Reubenite, Gog was probably a title formed by Ezekiel himself from the word Magog, the syllable ma being treated as equivalent to \"land.\" A similar freedom appears to have been exercised by the author of the Apocalypse, who out of Magog, here a territorial designation, makes a military power co-ordinate with Gog (Revelation 20:8). That Gog was not an actual person - though the name reminds one of that of the Lydian king Gyges, as it appears on the monuments, Gu-gu, Gu-ug-gu, aud of that of one Sa-gi, or Sa-agi, the ruler of another Eastern territory not yet identified (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschriften und dos Alto Testament,' p. 427; and comp. 'Records of the Past,' first series, vol. 9:46) - but an ideal character, must be held as proved by the composite structure of his army, which was drawn from the four comers of the globe, as well as by the highly imaginative texture of the whole prophecy, which, as Hengstenberg properly remarks, has a thoroughly \"utopian [perhaps better, 'ideal'] character,\" showing that it moves \"in the region of holy fancy.\" The words, the land of Magog, are not, with Havernick, Ewald, and Smend, to be interpreted as the local or geographical terminus of the prediction, as if the word of God had said, \"Set thy face toward Gog, toward the laud of Magog;\" but, with the majority of expositors, as a territorial designation signifying that Gog was in or of the laud of Magog, which is here marked with the article, probably to identify it with the well-known Magog mentioned in Genesis 10:2, along with Tubal and Mesech as among the descendants of Japheth. From the circumstance that in the table of nations Magog stands between Gomer (the Cimmerians) and Madai (the Medians), and that Gomer appears in Gog's army, it has been not unreasonably concluded that to Ezekiel Magog represented a fierce Northern tribe, most likely, as Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) asserts, the Scythians, whose territories lay upon the borders Of the sea of Azov and in the Caucasus. Plumptre even thinks that, \"placed as Ezekiel was, he may well have come into contact with these Scythian tribes, either as part of Nebuchadnezzar's army or by a journey on his part into the regions north of Ararat\" ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' Expositor, vol. 8. p. 291, second series). Yet, could both of these hypotheses be established, it would not follow that Ezekiel was thinking merely, as Knobel and Gesenius suppose, of a future struggle which Israel should have to maintain against these genres Scythicas immanes et innumerabiles, as Jerome in his day described them. In addition to being named from his land, Gog is further distinguished by the peoples over whom he rules, Ezekiel styling him the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal - a translation adhered to by Hengstenberg, Ewald, and Smend; or, according to the LXX., which most expositors and the Revised Version follow, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. The former rendering is obtained by interpreting נְשִׂיא רלֺאשׁ after the analogy of הַכֹּהֵן רלֺאשׁ, \"chief priest,\" or \"minister,\" in 1 Chronicles 27:5; and is supported by a similar use of the word rosh on coins under the government of the Persian satraps; yet the second rendering is not devoid of considerations that may be urged in its favor. Besides being grammatically possible, it yields a souse which is not improbable. Byzantine and Arabian writers of the tenth century were acquainted with a people called οἱ Ρῶς, who were Scythian mountaineers, dwelling north of the Taurus, on the shores of the Black Sea and on the banks of the Volga. The Koran speaks of a land of Ras not far from the Araxes. Whether either of these can be connected with present-day Russians, as Gesenius suggests - an hypothesis which Hengstenberg protests deals hardly with the poor Russians - must be left undecided. So must the question whether the people inquired after can be identified, as Delitzsch suggests, with the inhabitants of the land of Raseh (mat Ra-a-si) of the Inscriptions, which was Situated on the confines of Elam on the Tigris (see Schrader, 'Die Keilin-schriften und das Alto Testament,' p. 427; and comp. 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 84, 11. 122, 124). At the same time, Jerome's objection will scarcely hold good against understanding Resh as the name of a people, viz. that the Bible elsewhere has no knowledge of any such people, since, as Havernick observes, \"one cannot know beforehand whether to Ezekiel, in his then place of abode, the knowledge of such a people was not likely sooner to come than to any Old Testament writer,\" and it is certain that the Book of Ezekiel is not wanting in names that occur only once, as e.g. Chilmad (Ezekiel 27:23) and Chub (Ezekiel 30:5). Hitzig points out that in Genesis 10, along with Mesech and Tubal, is mentioned a third nation, Tiras, which Yon Hammer has attempted to connect with Rosh; while Schroder sees in Rosh (allied to Ross, \"horse\") an indication that the people were equestrian in their habits, like the Scythians. The other peoples, Meshech and Tubal, were undoubtedly the Mosohians and Tibarenes, who, according to Herodotus (3:94; 7:78), dwelt south of the Black Sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I am against thee, O Gog. Just because Gog was against Israel, Jehovah was against Gog. Gog's invasion of Israel's land would be a declaration of war against Israel's God. so that the conflict would rather be between Jehovah and Gog than between Israel and Gog. Hence throughout this prophecy Jehovah is represented as the principal actor on the side of Israel, who seeks her defense not in walls and bulwarks or in earthly alliances and military combinations, s in the days of the monarchy before the exile, but in the presence of Jehovah in her midst.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will turn thee back. שׁובַבְתִּיך (pilel of שׁוּב, and signifying \"to cause to return\") has by Hitzig, Havernick, Ewald, and Keil, been interpreted in the sense of \"enticing,\" \"misleading,\" decoying to a dangerous enterprise, as in Isaiah 47:10; but the ordinary meaning seems sufficient, that Jehovah would turn him back from his own self-devised career, or turn him about like a wild beast, putting hooks into his jaws (comp. Ezekiel 29:4; 2 Kings 19:28; Isaiah 37:29), and so compelling him to follow the lead of a power superior to himself. It is as evident that a turning back from the Holy Land cannot be intended, as it is that a turning back to the Holy Land is unsuitable, unless, with Hengstenberg and Ewald, one regards Gog as the Chaldeans, or, with Hitzig, and Schroder, as the Scythiaus, though these latter never were in Palestine, having left it unvisited in their campaign in B.C. 626, and had not as yet formed the design of invading Israel. Smend is not wide of the mark in suggesting that the thought expressed in the verb is simply that of the superior might of Jehovah. I will bring thee forth. That the power which stirs up Gog is here represented as that of Jehovah, while in Revelation 20:8 it is affirmed to be that of Satan, need occasion no more difficulty than the similar statements, in 1 Samuel 24:1, about God and in 1 Chronicles 21:1 about Satan, stirring up David to number Israel. The enumeration of horses and horsemen in Gog's army points to the Scythians, who, according to Herodotus (4:46, 136), were mostly equestrian tribes, although the Scythian remains discovered at Kerteh do not give an example of a Scythian horse-archer (see Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 34, note 6). All of them clothed with all sorts of armor, better, clothed with perfection, i.e. splendidly attired, all of them. A characteristic of the Assyrian army (comp. Ezekiel 23:12; Nahum 2:3). The arms of the warlike host - a great company, as in Ezekiel 17:17 (comp. Revelation 20:8, \"the number of whom is as the sand of the sea\") - are described as consisting of bucklers, or shields large enough to cover the whole of the soldier, and not so suitable for cavalry as for infantry (comp. Ezekiel 23:24); shields, i.e. bucklers of smaller size than the proceeding, such as Assyrian warriors were accustomed to carry (Sayce, 'Assyria, its Princes, Priests, and People,' p. 126); and swords, or weapons for laying waste. The Assyrian soldiery employed \"the short dagger, or dirk, and the sword, which was of two kinds. The ordinary kind was long and straight, the less usual kind being curved, like a scimitar\" ('Assyria, its Princes,' etc.). In connection with the allied nations in ver. 5, only the small \"shield\" and \"helmet\" are mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPersia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - These allied nations are depicted as coming from the four quarters of the globe. Persia (see Ezekiel 27:10), from the east; Ethiopia (see Ezekiel 30:5), or Gush (Genesis 10:6), from the south; Libya, or Phut (see Ezekiel 27:10; Ezekiel 30:5), from the west; and Gomer (see Genesis 10:2, 3; 1 Chronicles 1:5), the Cimmerians of Homer ('Odyss.,' 11:13-19), whose abodes were the shores of the Euxine and Caspian Seas, and the Gimirrai of the Assyrian Inscriptions (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschriften,' etc., p. 80); with the house of Togarmah, from the north, or the extreme regions of the north, as in Isaiah 14:13 (see Ezekiel 27:14). The first three are portrayed as armed with shield and helmet, or more accurately as being all of them shield and helmet, which might signify that they should serve as a shield and helmet to Cog, who in truth should be unto them and their confederates a guard; i.e., according to Keil and Schroder, one who keeps watch over them; according to Miehaelis and Havernick, one who gives them law; according to Hengstenberg, one who is their authority; according to Ewald and Smend, one who serves to them as an ensign, t.¢. acts to them as a leader or commander. The LXX. translation, with which Hitzig agrees, \"And thou shalt be to me for a guard,\" is manifestly wrong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - After many days thou halt be visited. The principal controversy raised by these words is as to whether they signify, as Hitzig, Fairbairn, and Kliefoth suppose, that after many days Gog should be entrusted with the command of the aforementioned nations, or, as Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, Plumptre, and Currey translate, that Gog, who intended to visit Israel, should himself be visited, in the sense of being punished. In support of the former rendering appeal is taken to Nehemiah 7:1; Nehemiah 12:44; and Jeremiah 15:3; but the verb פָםקד when used in this sense is commonly followed by עַל with the accusative of that or those with reference to which or whom the appointment is made or commission issued, and in addition no such commission with reference to these other nations was ever given by God to Gog. In vindication of the second meaning of the words, Isaiah 24:22 and Isaiah 29:6 are ordinarily quoted: while in answer to the objection that it is too soon to talk of punishment for an offense not yet committed, it is customary to reply that, as Jehovah's stirring up of Gog was the first step towards his ultimate overthrow, that stirring up might fairly be described as at least the beginning of his judicial visitation. Havernick's translation, \"For a long time thou wilt be missed,\" i.e. considered as a people that has utterly vanished,\" is forced; Smend's is better, \"After many days thou shalt be mustered,\" or numbered. In any case Gog's first movement should take place in the latter years; literally, at the end of the years - a frequent prophetic phrase (see Genesis 49:1; Numbers 24:14; Isaiah 2:2; Daniel 10:14; Micah 4:1), here denoting the Messianic era, and should assume the form of an invasion of the land of Israel, which is next described by a threefold characterization.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) As a land brought back from the sword, not in the sense of its people having been made to desist from war, through being henceforth peacefully inclined (comp. Isaiah 2:4; Micah 2:8), or of their having ceased to expect war, because of living ever after securely (ver. 11), but in that of having been recovered from its devastations (Ezekiel 6:3-5);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) as a land whose inhabitants had been gathered out of many nations - a phrase, which while starting from and including the return from Babylon, manifestly looked beyond that event to the wider dispersion of Israel that should precede the final ingathering; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) as a land whose mountains had been always waste; literally, for a waste continually. If such was their condition prior to the return from captivity, it is undeniable that such has practically been their condition ever since, and such it is likely to continue to be, until the final ingathering of the dispersed of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Like a storm, and like a cloud. Gog's invasion, his \"ascension,\" or \"going up\" (compare the Greek term ἀνάβασις for a military expedition), should be like a storm in its suddenness and violence, as in Ver. 1:27, and like a cloud in its threatening aspect and overshadowing nearness (see ver. 16; and comp. Jeremiah 4:13). Taken together, the images suggest that Gog's invasion should burst forth suddenly, rage violently, spread quickly, alarm greatly, but cease finally. Storms roar and crash, alarm and destroy, but do not continue. Clouds diffuse gloom and fear, but ultimately disperse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou shalt think an evil thought; \"conceive a mischievous purpose\" (margin); or, devise an evil device (Revised Version). The ultimate responsibility for Gog's expedition should rest on Gog himself, who should be impelled thereto by his own lust of conquest. Ezekiel here recognizes what the Bible is full of, the duality of existence, according to which man is both a free agent, acting out his own thoughts and plans, and an unconscious instrument in the hands of God carrying out his counsels and designs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12 give voice to the things that should come into Gog's mind and incite him to his enterprise against Israel. The spectacle of Israel dwelling safely, i.e. securely and confidently, in a land of un-walled villages - literally, a land of open places, as opposed to fortified cities - i.e. of towns without walls, and having neither bars nor gates (comp Zechariah 2:4, 5; Deuteronomy 3:5; 1 Samuel 6:18), because of being no more apprehensive of invasion, should excite within his bosom the thought that Israel would fall an easy prey to his assault; and this thought again should kindle in his bosom the lust of conquest which should finally impel him to the sinful project described, viz. to take a spoil and to take a prey; literally, to spoil the spoil (comp. Ezekiel 29:19; Isaiah 10:6) and to prey the prey (Isaiah 33:23). In execution of this he would fall upon the once desolate but then inhabited places, upon the once scattered but then collected population, upon the previously poor but then wealthy inhabitants, who should then have gotten cattle and goods (cattle and chattel best renders the Hebrew parouomasia, mikneh vekinyan), as the patriarchs of their nation had once done (Genesis 34:23; Genesis 36:6), and who should then be dwelling in the midst of the land; literally, in the height, or, navel (LXX., Vulgate), of the earth (comp. Judges 9:37), the Hebrews generally regarding Palestine as the Greeks did Delphi, both as the middle (Ezekiel v 5) and perhaps therefore if not as the highest (Gesenius), at least as the fairest and most fertile portion of the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Sheba, and Dorian, and the merchants of Tarshish were the great trading communities of the South, East, and West respectively (see on Ezekiel 27:15, 20, 22, 25). The young lions thereof - i.e. of Tarshish, not of the other communities (Keil) - were probably intended to represent, not the\" authorities\" of Tarshish, as Hitzig suggests, but its smaller tradesmen who were equally rapacious with its larger merchants. All are depicted as following in the wake of Gog, like vultures in the rear of an army, and as inquiring whether Gog had come simply for the purpose of destruction or in the hope of trading with the booty he should capture. In this case they intimate their wish to be partakers of the spoil This (Plumptre), rather than the thirst for booty which characterized them (Keil), their question to Gog signified; Schroder's idea, that they purposed ironically to ridicule the smallness of the spoil which would reward so gigantic an expedition, has as little to recommend it as Kliefoth's suggestion, that they designed to intimate their sympathy with Gog's invasion of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-23. - The prophet is next directed to assure Gog of four things,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that in the latter days he should come up against Israel as predicted (vers. 14-16);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he should not do so without Divine observation, permission, and direction (vers. 16, ;17);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that nevertheless Jehovah's indignation should flame forth against him (ver. 18); andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) that Jehovah would magnify himself in his destruction.

Assuredly; because the barbarian chieftain will then be on the watch, as it were, to spy out Israel's defenseless condition, and to fix upon the most opportune moment for an assault. The LXX. read, \"Shalt thou not arise?\" Οὐκ... ἐγερθήση; and following it, both Hitzig and Ewald, without other justification, change תֵּדָע into תֵּעֹר, \"Wilt thou bestir thyself?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - All of them riding upon horses (see on ver. 4; and comp.

Jehovah meant that in taking vengeance upon Gog for assailing Israel, he would be seen to be a holy and a righteous God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time? As no existing prophecy, prior to Ezekiel's time, mentions Cog by name, it must be concluded eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that Ezekiel refers to prophecies known in his day, though no longer extant; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that his words simply mean that earlier prophets had predicted such an invasion of Israel in the last times as that which he announces under the leadership of Gog. The former opinion, though countenanced by Ewald, Kuenen, and Smend, is less probable than the latter, which expositors both ancient and modern favor. Schroder considers the hypothesis that earlier prophets had spoken of Gog by name as excluded by the interrogatory form of the sentence, since, had Cog been thus explicitly pointed out, there would, he thinks, have been no need to ask, \"Art thou he?\" But it is doubtful if the interrogatory form of the words had any other intention than to lend emphasis to the assertion that Gog was he to whom the earlier prophets had unconsciously referred. As to which earlier prophets he alluded opinions vary. Ewald cites Isaiah 10:6; Isaiah 17:4; Smend adding Micah 5:11; Zephaniah 3:8; Keil, Isaiah 25:5, 10; Jeremiah 30:23, 25; Joel 4:2, 11, etc.; Hengstenberg, Deuteronomy 32; Isaiah 24-27; Isaiah 34; and Fairbairn, Numbers 24:17-24; Isaiah 14:28-32; Isaiah 18; Joel 3; Daniel 2:44, 45; though Schroder is probably correct in holding that all should be included which represent the hostility of the heathen world as culminating in the latter days in a grand concentrated attack upon Israel. Smend sees in the unusual phenomenon that Ezekiel reflects upon earlier prophecies an indication of the declining spirit of prophetism; it should, however, rather be regarded as a sign of superior spiritual insight on the part of Ezekiel, who could discern that from the first the prophets had been guided in their utterances by One who was intimately acquainted with the whole world-program, and knew the end from the beginning, so that however dark and enigmatical their predictions might be when taken separately, when viewed in connection they were recognized as forming parts of a harmonious whole.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - Vers. 18 and 19 are not, as Hitzig, Kliefoth, and others explain, on the ground of the perfect, \"I have spoken\" (ver. 19), which, however, is rather a prophetical present - a free recapitulation of the earlier predictions, but a direct announcement through Ezekiel that when Gog should arrive upon the scene Jehovah should take the field against him, so that he should have to fight against Jehovah rather than against Israel. The expression, my fury shall come up in my face; or, my wrath ascends in rail nose, has parallels in Ezekiel 24:8; Psalm 18:9; and Deuteronomy 32:22, and describes the vehement breathing (inhalation and exhalation) of an angry man through his nose. The fire of Jehovah's wrath (comp. Ezekiel 21:36; 36:5) should make itself known in that day by a great shaking in the land of Israel, which can hardly, as Kliefoth surmises, refer to the final judgment, or, as Keil thinks, to the trembling of the whole earth, with all the creatures, before the Lord, who comes to judgment, as in Joel 4:16 and Zechariah 14:4, 5, since the locality in which this convulsion of nature is to happen is expressly defined as \"the land of Israel;\" but must be understood, with Schroder and Smend, as a figurative description of the terrible overthrow which Jehovah should inflict upon Gog, and which should produce within the heathen mind a feeling of consternation, as if the whole fabric of the globe were falling into ruin. Grounding upon what occurred at Sinai (Exodus 19:16-18), Hebrew writers generally depicted special interpositions of Jehovah as being witnessed to and accompanied by awe-inspiring natural convulsions (comp. Psalm 18:7, 15; Psalm 46:2, 3; Psalm 55:2; Isaiah 13:9-13; Isaiah 24:19-22; Jeremiah 4:23-26; Nahum 1:5; Zechariah 14:4); and in the same manner does Ezekiel delineate Jehovah's intervention in behalf of Israel and against Gog, as so alarming that all living creatures, irrational as well as rational - fishes of the sea, fowls of the heaven, beasts of the field, creeping things that creep upon the earth (or, ground - adamah), and men upon the face of the earth; or, ground (comp. Genesis 1:26; Genesis 7:21-23) - should shake at its accompanying manifestations, and that even the mightiest objects in nature, such as the mountains, steep places, or, \"reek-clefts\" (Ewald), such elevations as can only be ascended by means of steps as by a ladder (comp. Song of Solomon 2:14), and walls (comp. Jeremiah 15:20), including natural ramparts as well as humanly constructed erections, should be overthrown (ver. 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Every man's sword shall be against his brother (comp. Zechariah 14:13). The consternation produced by Jehovah's interposition should be such that the ranks of Gog should fall into utter confusion, and his warriors exterminate each other, as did the Midianites in the days of Gideon (Judges 7:22), and the Moabites, Ammonites, and Seiritea, who invaded Judah in the reign of Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 20:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - Pestilence and blood (comp. Ezekiel 5:17; Ezekiel 14:19; Ezekiel 28:23)... an overflowing rain and great hailstones - literally, stones of ice (comp. Ezekiel 13:11, 13) - fire, and brimstone, or, pitch (comp. Genesis 19:24). The imagery here brought together was probably borrowed from the accounts given in the Pentateuch of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:24), of the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7. - 10.), and of the extermination of the Canaanites (Joshua 10:11). The result of the whole would be to impress the minds of many nations with the conviction that Israel's God was both great and powerful, that, in fact, he was God alone.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel38:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.39":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-20. - In the first main division Ezekiel repeats the substance of what has already been advanced concerning the defeat of Gog (vers. 1-8), after which he strives to represent its completeness (vers. 9-20), by setting forthNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the immense quantity of spoil Israel should obtain from the fallen foe (vers. 9, 10).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the length of time it should take Israel to bury the dead and cleanse the land from defilement (vers. 11-16, andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the horrible carnage which should ensue on Gog's destruction, symbolized by a vast sacrificial feast prepared by Jehovah for the beasts and birds (vers. 17-20).

The word שְׁשֵּׁאתִיך is derived either from the numeral six, שֵׁשׁ, or from the root שָׁשָׁא, the import of which is uncertain, although a cognate root in Ethiopic suggests the idea of \"going on\" or \"proceeding\" - a meaning Havernick also finds in the Hebrew. The former derivation has been followed by the Authorized Version, which renders in the margin, \"I will strike thee with six plagues,\" or \"draw thee back with a hook of six teeth,\" and by Hengstenberg, With whom Plumptre agrees, \"1 will six thee,\" i.e. \"afflict thee with six plagues,\" viz. those mentioned in Ezekiel 38:22. The latter derivation, presumably the more correct, is adopted by the LXX. (καθοδογήσω), the Vulgate (educam), the Revised Version (\"I will lead thee on\"), and by modern expositors generally. Hitzig and Smend approve of Ewald's translation, \"I entice thee astray, and lead thee with leading, strings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand. Bows and arrows were characteristic weapons of the Scythians, whom Herodotus (4:46) styles ἱπποτοξόται (comp. Jeremiah 5:16; Jeremiah 6:23; and see note on Ezekiel 38:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-6. - I will give thee unto ravenous birds of every sort; or, wing. The language depicts an army on the march, followed by jackals, vultures, and other birds of prey, ready to feast upon the corpses of slaughtered men (comp. Ezekiel 33:27; 1 Samuel 17:46; and Homer's 'Iliad,' 1:4, 5). In addition to destroying Cog, causing him to fall upon the mountains of Israel and upon the open field; literally, upon the face of the field, Jehovah engages to carry the fire of war and generally of devastation (cf. Ezekiel 33:22; Amos 2:2, 5; Revelation 20:29) into Cog's own land, Magog (see on Ezekiel 38:2), and among them that dwell carelessly (better, securely) in the isles; or, coast-lands (Ezekiel 27:7); i.e. not merely the merchants of Tarshish or the \"isles\" of the trading nations mentioned in Ezekiel 38:13, as Hengstenberg and Plumptre prefer, but, as Smend, Schroder, and Keil explain, all the distant peoples of the coast-lands from whom Gog's armies were drawn (Ezekiel 38:5, 6), and in whom were many of Gog's sympathizers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Behold! it is come. \"The words which a man might speak on he-holding his purpose accomplished are, with Ezekiel's Bold anthropomorphism, put into the mouth of Jehovah\" (Plumptre).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10 set forth as the first proof of the greatness of Gog's overthrow the immense booty in the shape of weapons of war which should be obtained by the inhabitants of the cities of Israel. So huge should be the quantity of weapons left behind by the slain, that the Israelites should burn them with fire seven years. This burning of the weapons has been explained by Havernick, on the ground that weapons of war, as incompatible with Messianic times, should be no more required (cf. Isaiah 2:4); by Ewald, as in accordance with the custom of the Hebrews (Isaiah 9:5) and other ancient peoples (Livy, 38:23; Virgil, 'AEneid,' 8:562); by Hitzig and Smend, as prompted by the consideration that Israel, for whom Jehovah had fought, should have no further need of weapons; by Schroder, as indicating that for Israel these warlike instruments should then so completely lose their power to terrify that they might be looked upon simply as so much firewood; and by Keil, as designed to annihilate the enemy and remove every trace of him. Kliefoth appears nearest the mark, in suggesting that the emphasis lies upon the length of time the burning should continue; and that this was intended, by conveying an idea of the vastness of the spoil, to represent the thoroughness of Gog's destruction and of Israel's deliverance. That the whole delineation is symbolical appears from the number of years the weapons are said to serve for fuel, viz. seven, and from the character of the weapons themselves, which, if not entirely wooden, were at least all combustible. Of the \"armor\" generally (נֶשֶׁק, \"something joined,\" from a root signifying \"to join\") the pieces mentioned - the shields and the bucklers (see Ezekiel 38:4), the bows and arrows (see ver. 3), the hand-staves, or, javelins (margin), perhaps, as Hitzig and Smend suggest, the staff with which a horseman strikes his beast (see Numbers 22:27), and the spears - were mostly composed of timber. When all should have been given to the flames, it would then appear that on their late owners the lex talionis had worked out its literal avengement, that they who had intended to despoil Israel were themselves spoiled; and they who hoped to plunder Israel were themselves plundered (comp. Isaiah 17:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-16 contain a second proof of the completeness of Gog's destruction, viz. the length of time occupied in burying the slain and cleansing the land. Verse 11. - Gog, who should invade Israel in the hope of acquiring the entire mastery of her land, would obtain at Jehovah's hands only a place there of graves, i.e. either, as Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend suggest, a place where a grave might be possible - a place large enough to receive his slaughtered carcasses; or as Havernick proposes, \"an altogether special grave as no other in Israel;\" or as Schroder interprets, \"a place where there is a grave for him and nothing else.\" Concerning both the designation and the site of this divinely provided sepulcher controversy has arisen.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) As to its site. The notion of Michaelis and Eiehhom, that the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea was in some way related to the mountains of Abarim mentioned in Numbers 27:12 and Deuteronomy 32:49, and that of Hitzig, that it signified \"the valley of the opposite heights,\" as in 1 Samuel 17:3, and was to be sought for in the \"very great valley\" of Zechariah 14:4, may at once be dismissed - the former as untenable, and -the latter as far-fetched. The suggestion of Hengstenberg and Kliefoth, that by the burial-place of Gog was meant the valley of Megiddo, where Josiah fell in battle against Pharaoh-Necho (2 Kings 23:29), derives support from these considerations, that the very name of Megiddo points to battles, that in its vicinity are found such passes as are here described, and that its modern designation Lejun (Leqio), in all probability contains a reminiscence of the present passage. It is, however, open to the obvious objections that the place of Gog's burial was not contiguous to the field of his overthrow, and that the clause locating it \"on the east of the sea,\" by which on this hypothesis must be understood the Mediterranean, is rather descriptive of the entire land than of any particular spot therein. Hence the view of Havernick, Ewald, Keil, and Smoud, which finds the valley in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea, is to be preferred, though, even with agreement as to this, interpreters are not unanimous as to the spot intended. Ewald thinks of \"the horrible, unwholesome valley over against the sea, i.e. (comp. Ezekiel 47:8) the Dead Sea, that valley which covers the ancient overbearing ones (die Zerreisenden), the Sodomites, who resemble these;\" Keil, translating kidmath as \"in front of,\" holds by \"the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea;\" Havernick and Smend advocate \"a place outside the Holy Land,\" though the clause, \"a grave in Israel,\" seems against this. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' hints, net without reason, that the valley was \"imaginary.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) As to its designation. That in the word \"passengers\" lies a paronomasia is apparent; but whether threefold or only twofold is uncertain. In the present verse הָעֹבְרִים may signify eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) such travelers as were wont to pass through the valley (Keil), which is the obvious and natural interpretation; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the warriors of Gog (Ewald, Hitzig), who intended to pass through the land, but whose invasion had only proved a passing storm; orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the commissioners who should be appointed to pass through the land in search of bones (ver. 15). The notion of Ewald, who derives עֹבִרִים from עֶבְרָה, and translates \"haughty,\" \"overbearing,\" meaning the Gogites, is countenanced by no ether expositor. If the first sense be taken, then the verse will read, \"The valley of the passers through, and it (the valley, in consequence of having become the grave of Gog) stops (the way of) the passers through;\" i.e. it becomes thereafter impassable for travelers (Rosenmüller, Keil); or, it stops the noses, or breath, of such travelers by reason of its horrible stench (Ewald, Havernick). If the second meaning be selected, the valley must be understood to have afterwards received its name from the fact that Gog's warriors lay entombed beneath its sod, and \"the stopping of the passengers\" to signify that whereas Gog purposed to overrun the land, his destructive career was there ignominiously arrested (Schroder). If the third rendering be preferred, then the valley will be held to have derived its designation, after the event, from the passing through it or through the land of the searchers, in which case the stepping of the passengers can only have alluded to the fact that, as the \"buriers\" proceeded with the work of interment, they were compelled to turn away their faces and stop their noses because of the noisome effluvium which arose from the corpses. The first interpretation is the best, though the first and second might be combined by making the first \"passengers\" stand for the travelers and the second for the invaders, whose career should there be stopped; and to this view a certain countenance is lent by the statements which follow, that there should Gog and all his multitude - literally, all his noisy tumult - be buried, and that the valley ever afterwards should bear the name of Hamon-gog, or, Gog s multitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - The time that should be occupied in Gog's funeral should be seven months - so great should be the number of the dead - the sacred number seven recalling the seven years consumed in the burning of the weapons (ver. 9), and reminding one of the \"seven times heated\" furnace into which the Hebrew children were cast, and of the \"seven times\" of Nebuchadnezzar's humiliation (Daniel 3:19; Daniel 4:23). The parties who should conduct his obsequies should be the house of Israel, even all the people of the land, indicating the common joy occasioned by the barbaric chieftain's overthrow. The motive which should impel them in their work would be a desire to cleanse the land from the defilement it had contracted from the corpses of the slain (comp. Numbers 19:11, 22; Numbers 31:19; Numbers 35:33); and the end should be that the work should be to them, not for \"a remembrance\" (Ewald), but a renown, not because they should have helped to bury Gog (Hengstenberg), or through burying Gog should have proved themselves his conquerors (Smend), and in virtue of Jehovah's protection the possessors of his grave (Hitzig), but because in the day when Jehovah glorified himself through Gog's destruction, he (Jehovah) should also be glorified by their (Israel's) zeal \"to show themselves a holy people by sweeping all uncleanness away\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - When the work of burying Gog should have gone on for seven months, at the end of that time the Israelites should sever out (comp. Deuteronomy 10:8) men of continual employment; literally, men of con-t/nuance; i.e. persons hired for a continuous work or devoted to a constant occupation, whose business it should be passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain - or, as the Revised Version reads, to bury them that pass through, that remain - upon the face of the land. Here, again, the old play upon the word \"passengers\" recurs, and with it two or three difficulties.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) It is not clear whether the commissioners consisted of two classes of officers, \"passers through,\" or \"searchers,\" who scoured the land in search of unburied skeletons or bones, which, however, they did not bury; and \"buriers\" proper, who, accompanying these searchers, conducted the interment of such skeletons or bones as were found (Hengstenberg, Keil); or whether the commissioners were only one body, who both searched and buried (Ewald and Smend).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) It is doubtful whether the אֶת in אֶת־הָעֹבְרִים should be taken as the sign of the accusative, and the clause translated as in the Revised Version, in which case the \"passengers\" that should be buried could only be the \"invaders\" as above (see ver. 11); or as a preposition, in which case the rendering of the Authorized Version must stand, and the \"passengers\" be regarded as the \"searchers.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It is open to debate whether ver. 14 should not close with the initial words of ver. 15, as Ewald proposes, \"And the passengers shall search and pass through in the land;\" or at least whether the first clause in ver. 15 should not form an independent sentence, thus: \"And they that pass through in the land shall pass through,\" as in the Revised Version, in which case the sighting of unburied bones (ver. 15) would not necessarily be the work of \"searchers,\" but of any one, the verb וְרָאָה being impersonal. It is impossible to decide dogmatically in a question of so much difficulty; but the Revised Version appears to present the most exact rendering of the Hebrew, and upon the whole the most intelligible account of what was intended to take place, viz. the appointment of a special body of commissioners, who should be designated both \"passengers,\" in ironical allusion to Gog who had meant to pass through the land, and \"buffers,\" from the nature of the task delegated to them, viz. the interment of the \"passengers,\" i.e. the Gogites, and who should begin their work after the main body of the slain had been removed, i.e. at the end of the seven months of burying.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15 describes the method of procedure these \"searchers\" and \"buriers,\" should follow. If these were distinct from each other, the \"searchers\" - if they were the same, any others - on discovering a man's bone should set up a sign by it; literally, build near it a pillar; erect a heap of stone (comp. 2 Kings 23:17; Jeremiah 31:21) to call the attention of the butlers, who, on coming to the spot, should inter it in the valley of Hamon-gog.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - As another mark to distinguish Gog's tomb, a city should arise in its vicinity, bearing the name Hamonah, or \"Multitude\" (comp. Isaiah 19:18, \"the city of destruction\"), though Schmieder thinks it must have been \"a city of graves,\" since a city of houses could not exist in such a valley of the dead, and indeed the LXX. gives as the city's name Πολυάνδριον, by which later Greek writers were accustomed to call the common ground in a cemetery as distinguished from its paternal sepulchers. If quite improbable that Bethshan or Scythopolis near Megiddo was Ezekiel's Hamonah, it is possible the actual city may have been named after the ideal. Plumptre cites as a modern parallel the English town of Lichfield (or \"Field of corpses\"), which, according to tradition, commemorates the destruction of the Danes. When the work of the buriers should be finished, the land would be completely cleansed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-20 exhibit in a third way the severity of Gog's overthrow by setting forth the bloody carnage which should attend it. Verse 17. - Expanding the thought of ver. 4, and borrowing the imagery of the older prophets, Isaiah (Isaiah 34:6; Isaiah 56:9) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 46:10; Jeremiah 50:29; Jeremiah 51:40), Ezekiel represents Gog's destruction as a great sacrifice - literally, slaying; hence a sacrificial feast or simply banquet (as in Genesis 31:54) - upon the mountains of Israel, prepared by Jehovah for the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field, which he, therefore, invites to come from all quarters to eat flesh and drink blood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18 specifies the victims whose flesh and blood should form their banquet, viz. the mighty, as in Ezekiel 32:12, 27, and the princes of the earth, meaning the nobles and other dignitaries in Gog's army, who, in accordance with the symbol of a feast, are spoken of as \"rams,\" \"lambs,\" \"goats,\" \"bullocks,\" and \"fatlings of Bashan\" (comp. Psalm 22:12). \"Per haec animantium, quae in saarificiis usurpari solebant, nomina varii hominum ordines intelliguntur, principum, ducum, militum, quod et Chaldaeus observat \" (Grotius. Comp.

The special lesson for them should be not so much teaching concerning God's supremacy over them, or concerning their relation to Israel, as concerning the principles of God's dealings with Israel. They should learn that if Israel had for a season been abandoned to the sword and driven into exile, it was not because of Jehovah's inability to protect them, but because of their wickedness which had caused him to hide his face from them - an expression which in Ezekiel occurs only here and in ver. 29, though it is found in the Pentateuch (Deuteronomy 31:17, 18) and in the older prophets (Isaiah 8:17; Isaiah 54:8; Isaiah 57:17; Isaiah 64:7; Jeremiah 33:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-29. - This section Hengstenberg regards as the close of the whole system of prophecies of a predominantly comforting character from Ezekiel 33:21 onwards;\" Keil views it as the proper conclusion to the prophecy concerning Gog and the series of predictions from Ezekiel 35:1 onwards. It is in substance a recapitulation of God's gracious promise to bring again the captivity of Israel, of which the prophet had just been reminded in ver. 23, and to which accordingly he now in thought goes back. It traces the whole course of the Divine dealings with the nation from the point of the exile onwards. Verse 25. - I will bring again the captivity of Jacob. (For the use of \"Jacob\" as a designation of the people, see Ezekiel 28:25; Ezekiel 37:25.) The promise goes back to Deuteronomy 30:3; Jeremiah 29:14; Jeremiah 30:3; Jeremiah 31:23; Jeremiah 32:44; and other passages. That its fulfillment began with the return from Babylon is not inconsistent with the view that its fulfillment will terminate with the final ingathering of Israel out of the nations by her conversion to Christianity, and her consequent admission to the Church. That its first cause will be \"mercy\" to the whole house of Israel will not prevent that cause from being at the same time a jealous regard for the Divine holiness (comp. Ezekiel 36:21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - After they have borne their shame (comp. Ezekiel 16:52, 54; Ezekiel 32:24, 30; Ezekiel 34:29; Ezekiel 36:6). The captivity of Israel would not be brought back until her people had been thoroughly chastised for their iniquities, and that chastisement had wrought in them a spirit of penitence and a disposition towards obedience. Then should Jehovah interpose for their deliver-ante by gathering them out of their enemies' lands and leading them back to their own land; and these two experiences, the Captivity and the Restoration, the driving out and the bringing in, should complete their conversion to Jehovah, and secure their perpetual enjoyment of Jehovah's favor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel39:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel. Already Jehovah had promised to put his Spirit in his people (Ezekiel 36:27; Ezekiel 37:14); now the fact that he has implemented that promise by a copious effusion of the same he cites as a proof that Israel shall no more forfeit his favor because no more shall she forsake his ways (comp. Isaiah 59:21). The same promise had been previously given by Joel (Joel 2:28), and was afterwards renewed by Zechariah (Zechariah 12:10). The citation of Joel's words by Peter on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:17) shows that he regarded the remarkable effusion of the Holy Ghost on that memorable occasion as a fulfillment of the premise here recorded by Ezekiel. Yet the promise was not then exhausted. Rather it has often since been implemented, and will doubtless receive its consummation in the New Jerusalem. \"No historical Church, Jewish or Gentile,\" writes Plumptre, \"has ever yet realized the picture here sketched by Ezekiel. We ask, as before - Will it ever be realized on earth? or must we look for it only in the heavenly city whose Builder and Maker is God?\" NOTE. - In addition to what has been stated at the beginning of this prophecy (Ezekiel 38:1) with reference to the general significance of this invasion by and overthrow of Cog, that it points to some tremendous conflict in the latter days between the powers of the world and the Church of Christ, a few words may be offered in support of the preposition that nevertheless there is no reason to expect that this conflict will take the form of an actual invasion of the land of Israel or of a real fire-and-sword battle with the Church, or that Gog will step upon the field as a veritable flesh-and-blood personality, and his armies find a grave in the manner sketched by the prophet. That the whole delineation is symbolic, and embodies spiritual truths under material emblems, will hardly be doubted by one who impartially weighs the following considerations, which have been admirably brought together by Fairbairn.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The designation given to the great assailant of the latter times - Gog, which discovers itself to be an ideal name, if by nothing else by the manner in which it has been formed.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The composition of his army, which is drawn from the four quarters of the globe, in fact, from the extremities of the earth, and consists of peoples not only remote from one another, but \"the most unlike naturally to act in concert for any particular purpose.\"NEWLINENEWLINE3. The object of his attack - the land of Israel, a territory so small that it is inconceivable a host so great should have been required to capture it, and so poor that had the invaders got all it contained it \"could not have served to maintain them for a single day.\"NEWLINENEWLINE4. The fruits of Israel's victory - firewood for seven years out of the enemies' weapons, and seven months of labor in burying their corpses. \"It would be but a very moderate allowance, on the literal supposition, to say that a million of men would thus be engaged, and that on an average each would consign two corpses to the tomb in one day; which for the hundred and eighty working days of the seven months would make an aggregate of three hundred and sixty millions of corpses! Then the putrefaction, the pestilential vapors arising from such masses of slain victims, before they were all buried. Who could live at such a time?\"NEWLINENEWLINE5. The impossibility of harmonizing prophecy on the hypothesis that Ezekiel's picture must receive a literal interpretation, since Isaiah (Isaiah 34.), Joel (Joel 3:12, 14), and Zechariah (Zechariah 14), who all appear to depict the same conflict as Ezekiel portrays, each pitches its scene in a different locality.NEWLINENEWLINE6. The gross carnality of the whole picture on the assumption that it must be literally interpreted, which is wholly inconsistent with that spirituality one associates with the Messianic times. \"Persons,\" writes Fairbairn, \"who in the face of all these considerations can still cling to the literal view of this prophecy, must be left to themselves; they are incapable of being convinced in the way of argument.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Eat that thou findest, etc. The iteration of the command of Ezekiel 2:8 seems to imply, like the words, \"be not thou rebellious,\" in that verse, some reluctance on the prophet's part. In substance the command was equivalent to that of Revelation 22:18, 19. The true prophet does not choose his message (Acts 4:20); his \"meat\" is to do his Lord's will (John 4:34), and he takes what he \"finds\" as given to him by that will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It was in my mouth as honey, etc. The words remind us of Psalm 19:10; Proverbs 24:13; and again of those of Jeremiah in the darkest hour of his ministry (Jeremiah 15:16). They are reproduced yet more closely by St. John (Revelation 10:9). There is, after the first terror is over, an infinite sweetness in the thought of being a fellow worker with God, of speaking his words and not our own. In the case of St. John, the first sweetness was changed to bitterness as soon as he had eaten it; and this is, perhaps, implied here also in ver. 14. The first ecstatic joy passed away, and the former sense of the awfulness of the work returned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Of a strange speech and of a hard language, etc.; literally, as in margin, both of Authorized Version and Revised Version, to a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue; i.e. to a barbarous people outside the covenant, Chaldeans, Assyrians, Scythians: not speaking the familiar sacred speech of Israel (compare the \"stammering lips and another tongue\" of Isaiah 28:11; Isaiah 33:19). The thought implied is that Ezekiel's mission, as to \"the lost sheep of the house of Israel\" (Matthew 15:24), was outwardly easier than if he had been sent to the heathen. With Israel there was at least the medium of a speech common both to the prophet and his hearers. In ver. 6 the thought is enlarged by the use of \"many peoples.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Surely, if I sent thee to them, etc. The \"surely\" represents the Hebrew \"if not\" taken as a strong affirmation, just as \"if\" in Psalm 95:11 represents a strong negation; compare the use of the fuller formula jurandi in 1 Samuel 3:17; 2 Samuel 3:35; 2 Samuel 19:13; and of the same in Deuteronomy 1:35; Isaiah 62:8; and in Ezekiel himself (Ezekiel 17:19). The margin of the Authorized Version, If I had sent thee to them, would they not have hearkened, etc.? expresses the same meaning, but is less tenable as a translation. The thought in either case finds its analogue in our Lord's reference to Sodom and Gomorrah, to Tyre and Sidon (Matthew 11:21-24; Luke 10:12-14). Israel was more hardened than the worst of the nations round her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For they will not hearken unto me, etc. The words are, as it were, an a fortiori argument. Those who had despised the voice of Jehovah, speaking in his Law, or directly to the hearts of his people, were not likely to listen with a willing ear to his messenger. We are reminded of our Lord's words to his disciples in Matthew 10:24, 25. Impudent and hard-hearted; literally (the word is not the same as in Ezekiel 2:4), in Revised Version, of an hard forehead and of a stiff heart. The word \"hard\" is the same word as the first half of Ezekiel's name, and is probably used with reference to it as in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I have made thy face strong; literally, as in the Revised Version, hard. Ezekiel's name was at once nomen et omen. Hard as Israel might be, he could be made harder, i.e. stronger, than they, end should prevail against them (compare the parallels of Isaiah 1:7; Jeremiah 1:18; Jeremiah 15:20). The boldness of God's prophets is a strictly supernatural gift. Whatever persistency there may be in evil, they will be able to meet it, perhaps to overcome it, by a greater persistency in good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Adamant. The Hebrew word shemir is used in Jeremiah 17:1 (where the Authorized Version gives \"diamond\" for a stone used in engraving on gems. In Zechariah 7:12 it appears, as it does here, as a type of exceeding hardness. It is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament. It is commonly identified with the stone known as corundum, which appears in some of its forms as the sapphire and the Oriental ruby, and also as the stone the powder of which is used as emery. The special point of the comparison is, of course, that the adamant was actually used to cut either flint itself or stones as hard as flint. Neither be dismayed at their looks. The words indicate the extreme sensitiveness of the prophet's natural temperament. He had shrunk not only from the threats and revilings of the rebellious house, but even from their scowls of hatred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All my words, etc. The stress lies on the first word. The prophet was not to pick and choose out of the message, but was to deliver \"all the counsel of God\" (Acts 20:27). Take into thine heart, etc. An inverted order of the two commands would, perhaps, have seemed more natural. What we actually find, however, is sufficiently suggestive. The message of Jehovah is first received into the inner depths of the soul, but in that stage it is vague, undefined, incommunicable. It needs to be clothed in articulate speech before it can be heard with the mental ear and passed on to others. The mouth speaks out of the fulness of the heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Get thee to them of the Captivity, etc. In Ezekiel 2:3 and Ezekiel 3:1, 4 the mission had been to \"the house of Israel\" generally; now it is specialized. He is sent \"to them of the Captivity.\" They are the rebellious house. There is an obvious significance in the phrase, \"thy people.\" Jehovah can no longer recognize them as his. The words of Ezekiel 2:7 are repeated. Here also, even among the exiles, who were better than those that remained in Judah, he was to expect partial failure, but he was not, on that account, to shirk the completion of his task. Thus saith the Lord God; Adonai Jehovah, as in Ezekiel 2:4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Then the Spirit took me up, etc. The words are to be interpreted as in Ezekiel 2:2. Luther, however, gives \"a wind lifted me up.\" The parallels of Ezekiel 8:3 (where, however, we have the addition, \"in the visions of God\") and Ezekiel 11:1 suggest the conclusion that this was a purely subjective sensation, that it was one of the phenomena of the ecstatic state, and that there was no actual change of place. On the other hand, the use of like language in the cases of Elijah (1 Kings 18:12; 2 Kings 2:16), of our Lord (Mark 1:12), of Philip (Acts 8:39), would justify the inference that the prophet actually passed from one locality to the other. The language of 1 Kings 18:46 probably points to the true solution of the problem. The ecstatic state continued, and in it Ezekiel went from the banks of Chebar to the dwellings of the exiles at Tel-Abib (see note on ch. 1.), at some distance from it. I heard behind me, etc. The words imply that the prophet, either in his vision or in very deed. had turned from the glory of the living creatures and of the wheels, and set his face in the direction in which he was told to go. As he does so, he hears the sounds of a great rushing (LXX., σείσμος; Luther, \"earthquake\"), followed by words which, though in the form of a doxology, uttered, it may be presumed, by the living creatures, were also a message of encouragement. His readiness to do his work as a preacher of repentance calls forth the praise of God from those in whose presence there is \"joy over one sinner that repenteth.\" We are reminded of the earthquake in the Mount of Purification and the Gloria, in excelsis of Dante ('Purg.,' 20:127-141; 21:53-60). The words, from his place (belonging, probably, to the narrative rather than the doxology), point, not to the sanctuary at Jerusalem, which Jehovah had forsaken, but to the region thought of as in the north (see note on Ezekiel 1:4), to which he had withdrawn himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And I heard, etc. There is no verb in the Hebrew, but it may be supplied from ver. 12. We lose in the English the kissing, or touching, poetry of the original, \"each its sister.\" The attitude as of wings raised for flight, and the sound of both the wings and wheels, implied the departure of the glorious vision, presumably to the region from which it came.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Spirit lifted me up (see note on ver. 12). Here the LXX. has the more definite phrase, \"the Spirit of the Lord. For bitterness (see note on Ezekiel 2:3). The heat of my spirit. The first noun is here translated literally. Elsewhere it is rendered as \"wrath\" (Deuteronomy 29:23; Job 21:20; Proverbs 15:11, et al.), \"fury\" (Jeremiah 4:4). Here probably it points to the conflict of emotions - indignation against the sins of his people, the dread of failure, the consciousness of unfitness. The hand of the Lord, etc. The word for \"strong\" is the same as that which enters into Ezekiel's name. Taking this and ver. 9 into account, there seems sufficient reason for translating as the Vulgate does, confortans (so Luther, \"held me firm\"), at least for thinking of that meaning as implied (comp. Ezra 7:9; Ezra 8:18; Nehemiah 2:8; Daniel 10:18). There was a sustaining power in spite of the \"bitterness\" and the \"heat.\" In a more general sense, as in Ezekiel 1:3, it is used as implying a special intensity of prophetic inspiration, as in the case of Elisha (2 Kings 3:15); but this is the only case in which it occurs with the adjective \"strong.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - At Tel-Abib, etc., We now enter on the first scene of the prophet's ministry. The LXX. leaves the proper name. The Vulgate rightly translates it as acervus novarum frugum, the \"mound of ears of corn\" (the meaning appears in the name of the Passover month, Abib). Luther gives, strangely enough, \"where the almond trees stood, in the mouth Abib\"). Jerome's suggestion, that here also there was a nomen et omen. and that those who shared Ezekiel's exile were regarded as the \"firstfruits\" of the future, is at least ingenious, and finds some support in Psalm 126:5, 6. The place has not been identified, and its position depends on that of the river with which it is connected (see note on Ezekiel 1:1). The word \"Tel\" is commonly applied to the mounds formed out of masses of ruins, which are common all over the plains of Mesopotamia. The name in this case may suggest that the earth had gathered over it, and that it was cultivated. I sat where they sat, etc. The ministry begins not with speech, but silence. Our Western habits hardly enable us to enter into the impressiveness of such a procedure. The conduct of Job's friends (Job 2:13) presents a parallel, and as Ezekiel seems to have known that book (Ezekiel 14:14, 20), he may have been influenced by it. Like actions meet us in Ezra 9:3-5; Daniel 4:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A watchman unto the house of Israel. The seven days' session of amazement came to an end, but even then there was at first no utterance of a message. The word of the Lord came to his own soul, and told him what his special vocation as a prophet was to be. He was to be a \"watchman unto the house of Israel.\" He was, like the watchman of a city on his tower, to be on the look out to warn men against coming dangers, not to slumber on his post. In 2 Samuel 18:24-27 and 2 Kings 9:17-20 we have vivid pictures of such a work. It had already been used figuratively of the prophet's work by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 6:17). The cognate verb, with the image fully developed, meets us in Habakkuk 2:1. Its use in Hosea 9:8 is doubtful as to meaning, and in Isaiah 52:8 and Isaiah 56:10 it may be, if we accept the theory of a Deutero-Isaiah, an echo from Ezekiel. It is reproduced with special emphasis in Ezekiel 33:2-7. More than any word it describes the special characteristic of Ezekiel's work. He is to watch personally over individual souls. So in a like sense, a corresponding word is used of the Christian ministry in Hebrews 13:17 (compare also for the thought, though the word is not the same, Isaiah 21:11, 12; Isaiah 62:6; Psalm 127:1). A vivid picture of the work of such a watchman is found, it may be noted, in the opening speech of the 'Agamemnon' of AEschylus. Give them warning, etc. It is, I think, a legitimate inference that the prophet acted on the command while he was with the exiles and before the departure of ver. 22, not by harangues or sermons addressed to the whole body of the exiles, but by direct warning to individuals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Thou givest him not warning, etc. The word, as in the parallels already referral to, is characteristic of Ezekiel, almost indeed, peculiar to him. Psalm 19:11 may be noted as another instance of its use. When the watchman saw danger coming, he was to blow the trumpet (Ezekiel 33:3-6). The prophet was to speak his warnings. Thou shalt surely die; literally, dying thou shalt die. Were the words of Genesis 2:17 in the prophet's mind? To save his life; literally, for his life, or that he may live. Shall die in his iniquity. Do the words refer only to physical death coming as the punishment of iniquity? or do they point onward further to the judgment that follows death, the loss of the inheritance of eternal life which belongs to those whose names are written in the book of life? Looking to the tremendous responsibility implied in the words, we can hardly, I think, in spite of the questions which have been raised as to the belief of the Hebrews in the immortality of the soul, hesitate to accept the latter meaning. Ezekiel anticipates the teaching of Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5; Revelation 13:8, if, indeed, that meaning was not already familiar to him in Exodus 32:32, 33. For \"in\" his iniquity we may, perhaps, read \"because of.\" The negligence of the watchman does not avail to procure a full pardon for the evil doer. The degree in which it may extenuate his guilt depends on conditions known to God, but not to us. In any case, as in our Lord's words (Luke 12:47, 48), a man's knowledge and opportunities are the measure of his responsibility. But the unfaithful watchman has his responsibility. It is as though the blood of the sinner had been shed. His guilt may be described in the same words as that of Cain (Genesis 9:5). Compare St. Paul's words in Acts 18:6 and Acts 20:26 as echoes of Ezekiel's thought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thou hast delivered thy soul, etc. This phrase is again an eminently characteristic one (comp. Ezekiel 33:9). Here also, though the words do not necessarily imply more than deliverance from bodily death, thought of as a judgment for negligence, it is, I think, scarcely possible to avoid finding in them a \"springing and germinant\" sense, analogous to that which we have found in the preceding verse. The dread warning has for its complement a message of comfort. The judgment passed on the prophet does not depend on the results of his ministry. \"Whether men will bear, or whether they will forbear,\" he has \"delivered his soul,\" i.e. saved his life, when he has done his duty as a watchman. The phrase is noticeable as having passed out of the language of Scripture into familiar use. A man can say, \"Liberavi animam meam,\" when he has uttered his conviction on any question of importance affecting the well being of others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - From his righteousness. The Hebrew gives the plural, \"his righteousnesses\" - all his single righteous acts that lie behind. I lay a stumbling block, etc. The word is again characteristic (Ezekiel 7:19; Ezekiel 14:3, 4). It occurs in Jeremiah 6:21, and Ezekiel may have learnt the use of the word from him. It is found also in Leviticus 19:14 and Isaiah 57:14; but the date of these, according to the so called higher criticism, may be later than Ezekiel. In Isaiah 8:14: the word is different. The English word sufficiently expresses the sense. One of the acts of Eastern malignity was to put a stone in a man's way, that he might fall and hurt himself Here the putting the stone is described as the act of Jehovah, and is applied to anything that tempts a man to evil, and so to his own destruction (Jeremiah 6:21). The thought is startling to us, and seems at variance with true conceptions of the Divine will (James 1:13). The explanation is to be found in the fact that the prophet's mind did not draw the distinction which we draw between evil permitted and the same evil decreed. All, from this point of view, is as God wills, and even those who thwart that will are indeed fulfilling it. Glimpses are given of the purpose which leads to the permission or decree. In the case now before us the man has turned from his righteousness before the stumbling block is laid in his way. The temptation is permitted that the man may become conscious of his evil (so Romans 7:13). If the prophet preacher does his duty, the man may conquer the temptation, and the stumbling block may become a \"stepping stone to higher things.\" If, through the prophet's negligence, he comes unwarned, and stumbles and falls, he, as in the case of the wicked, bears the penalty of his guilt, but the prophet has here also the guilt of blood upon his soul. The \"righteousnesses\" of the man (here, as before, we have the plural), his individual acts of righteousness, shall not be remembered, because he was tried, and found wanting in the essential element of all righteousness. The highest development of the thought is found in the fact that Christ himself is represented as a \"stumbling stone\" (Isaiah 8:14; Romans 9:32, 33; 1 Corinthians 1:23). St. Paul's solution of the problem is found in the question, \"Have they stumbled that they should fall?\" (Romans 11:11). Was that the end contemplated in the Divine purpose Will it really be the end?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And the hand of the Lord was there upon me, etc. There is obviously an interval between the fact thus stated and the close of the message borne in on the prophet's soul. Psychologically, it seems probable that the effect of the message was to fill him with an overwhelming, crushing sense of the burden of his responsibility. How was he to begin so terrible a work? What were to be the nearer, and the remoter, issues of such a work? Apparently, at least, he does not then begin it by a spoken warning. He passes, at the Divine command borne in on his soul, from the crowd that had watched him during the seven days' silence, and betakes himself to the solitude of the \"plain,\" as distinct from the \"mound\" where the exiles dwelt, and there the vision appears again in all points as he had seen it when he stood on the river's bank.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Go, shut thyself within thy heroin, etc. The command implied that he was to cease for a time from all public ministrations. There was a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak (Ecclesiastes 3:7), and for the immediate future silence was the more effective of the two. It would, at least, make them eager to hear what the silence meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They shall put bands upon thee, etc. Did the warning mean that the prophet's hearers would treat him as the men of Jerusalem treated Jeremiah (Jeremiah 32:3; Jeremiah 33:1; Jeremiah 38:6)? Of this, at all events, we have no record, and so far we are led to the other alternative of taking the words (as in Ezekiel 4:8) in a figurative sense. The prophet would feel, as he stood in the presence of the rebellious house, as tongue tied, bound hand and foot by their hardness of heart, teaching by strange and startling signs only, and, it may be, writing his prophecies. In Ezekiel 24:27, four years later, and again in Ezekiel 29:21, we have a distinct reference to a long period of such protracted silence. We may compare, as in some sense parallel, the silence of Zacharias (Luke 1:22). That silence unbroken for nine months was a sign to those who \"were looking for redemption in Jerusalem,\" more eloquent than speech.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel3:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - When I speak with thee, etc. This then, as ever, was the condition of the prophet's work. He was to speak out of his own heart. When the \"time to speak\" came words would be given him (Matthew 10:19). And those he would then speak would be as the echo of those in ver. 11. In our Lord's words (Matthew 11:15; Matthew 13:9) we have, it may be, a deliberate reproduction of Ezekiel's formula. The LXX., in this instance, it may be noted, translates the second clause by \" He who is disobedient (ἀπειθῶν),NEWLINE","Ezek.40":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - The introduction to the vision. Verse 1. - In the five and twentieth year of our captivity; i.e. in B.C. 575, assuming Jehoiakin's deportation to have taken place B.C. 600, i.e. in the fiftieth year of the prophet's age, in the twenty-fifth of his prophetic calling, and in the fourteenth after the fall of Jerusalem. As the last note of time was the twelfth year (Ezekiel 32:17), it may be assumed the interval was largely occupied in receiving and delivering the prophecies that fall between those dates, though it is more than likely a period of silence preceded the vision of which this last section of the book preserves an account. If not the last of the prophet's utterances (see Ezekiel 29:17), it was beyond question the grandest and most momentous. Accordingly, the prophet notes with his customary exactness that the vision came to him in the beginning of the year, which Hitzig, whom Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' follows, believes to have been a jubilee year, which began on the tenth day of the seventh month. As, however, the practice of commencing the year with this month was not introduced among the Jews till after the exile, and as Ezekiel everywhere follows the purely Mosaic arrangement of the year, the presumption is that the beginning of the year here alluded to was the month Abib, and that the tenth day of the month was the day on which the Torah enjoined the selection of a lamb for the Passover. Indeed, the two clauses in Ezekiel read like an abbreviation of the Mosaic statute (Exodus 12:2, 3) - a circumstance sufficiently striking and probably significant, though emphasis should not, with Hengstenberg, be laid upon the fact that every word in Ezekiel's copy is found in the Exodus original. On that day, which was the anniversary of the beginning of a merciful deliverance to Israel in Egypt, of the initial step in a gracious process of transforming Pharaoh's captives into a nation, - on that day (for emphasis the selfsame day, as in Ezekiel 24:2), the prophet's soul was rapt into an ecstasy (see on Ezekiel 1:3), in which he seemed to be transported thither, i.e. towards the smitten city, and a disclosure made to him concerning that new community which Jehovah was about to form out of old Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - In the visions of God; i.e. in the clairvoyant state which had been superinduced upon him by the hand of God, and in which he became conscious both of bodily sensations and mental perceptions transcending those that were possible to him in his natural condition. Upon a very high mountain (comp. Matthew 4:8; Luke 4:5). Schroder stands alone in taking אֶל as \"beside\" rather than \"upon,\" other interpreters considering that אֶל has here the force of עַל, as in Ezekiel 18:6, and Ezekiel 31:12. That this mountain, though resembling the temple hill in Jerusalem, was not that in reality, but \"the mountain of the Lord's house\" of Messianic times (see on Ezekiel 43:12; and comp. Ezekiel 17:22, 23; Ezekiel 20:40; Isaiah 2:2; Micah 4:6), may be inferred from its greater altitude than that of either Moriah or Zion, which pointed obviously to the loftier spiritual elevation of the new Jerusalem. As the frame of a city on the south. What Ezekiel beheld was not \"beside\" or \"by\" (Authorized Version), but \"on\" the mountain, and was not, as Havernick, Ewald, and Kliefoth suppose, the new city of Jerusalem, though this might with a fair measure of accuracy be described as lying south of Moriah on which the temple stood, but the temple itself, which, with its walls and gates, chambers and courts, rose majestically before the prophet's view, with all the magnificence, and indeed (as the particle כִי. indicates), with the external appearance of a city. That the prophet should speak of it as \"on the south\" receives sufficient explanation from the circumstance that he himself came from the north, and had it always before him in a southerly direction. The idea is correctly enough expressed by the ἀπέναντι of the LXX., which signifies \"over against\" to one coming from the north.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The word \"thither\" carries the thought back to ver. 1. When the prophet had been brought into the land of Israel, to the mountain and to the building, he perceived a man, whoso appearance was like the appearance of brass, or, according to the LXX., \"shining or polished brass,\" χαλκοῦ στίλβοντος, as in Ezekiel 1:7 - a description recalling those of the likeness of Jehovah in Ezekiel 1:26, 27, of the angel who appeared to Daniel (Daniel 10:6), and of the glorified Christ (Revelation 1:15), and suggesting ideas of strength, beauty, and durability. In his hand he carried a line of flax and a measuring-reed (kaneh hammidah, or \"reed of measuring,\" reed having been the customary material out of which such rods were made; compare the Assyrian for a measuring-reed qanu, the Greek κανών, and the Latin canna). Possibly he carried these as \"emblems of building activity\" (Hengstenberg), and because \"he had many and different things to measure\" (Kliefoth); but most likely the line was meant to measure large dimensions (comp. Ezekiel 47:3) and such as could not be taken by a straight stick, as e.g., the girth of pillars, and the rod to measure smaller dimensions, like those of the gates and walls of the temple. Hitzig's conjecture, that the line was linen because the place to be measured was the sanctuary, whose priests were obliged to clothe themselves in linen, Kliefoth rightly pronounces artificial and inaccurate, since the line was made, not of manufactured flax, or linen, but of the raw material. That the \"man\" was Jehovah or the Angel of the Presence (comp. Ezekiel 9:2) the analogy of Amos 8:7, 8 and the statement of Ezekiel in Ezekiel 44:2, 5 would seem to suggest; only it is not certain in the last of these passages that the speaker was \"the man\" and not rather \"the God of Israel,\" who had already taken possession of the house (see Ezekiel 43:2), and whose voice is once at least distinguished from that of the man (see Ezekiel 43:6). Accordingly, Kliefoth, Smend, and others identify the \"man\" with the ordinary angelus interpres (cf. Revelation 21:9). The gate in which he stood \"waiting for the new comer\" was manifestly the north gate, since Ezekiel came from the north, though Havernick and Smend put in a plea for the east gate, on the grounds that it was the principal entrance to the sanctuary, and the distance between it and the north gate, five hundred cubits, was too great to be passed over so slightly as in ver. 6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The threefold summons addressed to the prophet (comp. Ezekiel 44:5) intimated the importance of the communication about to be made, and reminded him of the necessity of giving it the closest attention in order to be able to impart it to the people (comp. Ezekiel 43:10, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5-27. - The outer court, with its gates and chambers:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the enclosing wall (ver. 5);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the east gate (ver. 5-16);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the outer court (ver. 17-19);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the north gale (ver. 20-23);NEWLINENEWLINE(5) the south gate (ver. 24-27). Verse 5. - The enclosing wall. And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about. The \"house\" - הַבַּיִת with the article - was the temple as the dwelling-place of Jehovah; only not the temple proper, but the whole complex structure. The \"wall\" belonged to the outer court; that of the inner court being afterwards mentioned (Ezekiel 42:7). In having a \"wall round about\" Jehovah's sanctuary resembled both Greek and Babylonian shrines (see Herod., 1:18; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:126), but differed from both the tabernacle, which had none, and from the Solomonic temple, whose \"wall\" formed no essential part of the sacred structure, but was more or less of arbitrary erection on the part of Solomon and later kings. Here, however, the wall constituted an integral portion of the whole; and was designed, like that in Ezekiel 42:20, \"to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place,\" as the Greeks distinguished between the βέβηλον and the ἱερόν (see Thucyd., 4:95). Its breadth and height were the same (comp. Revelation 21:16) - one reed, of six cubits by the cubit and an hand-breadth; that is to say, each cubit measured an ordinary cubit and a hand-breadth (comp. Ezekiel 43:13). Hengstenberg suggests that the greater cubit of Ezekiel was borrowed from the Chaldeans; and certainly Herodotus (1. 178) speaks of a royal cubit in Babylon which was three finger-breadths longer than the ordinary measure, while in Egypt also two such cubits of varying lengths were current (Bockhart, 'Metrol. Untersuch,' p. 212); \"from which it might be supposed,\" says Smend, \"that the same thing held good for Asia Minor.\" Still, the hypothesis is likelier that the cubit in question was the old Mosaic cubit - the cubit of a man (Deuteronomy 2:11), equal to the length of the forearm from the elbow to the end of the longest finger - which was employed in the building of the Solomonic temple (2 Chronicles 3:3). Assuming the cubit to have been eighteen inches, the height and breadth of the wall would be nine feet - no great elevation, and presenting a striking contrast to the colossal proportions of city walls in Babylon and in Greece (see Herod., 1:170; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:127, 1st series), and even of the walls of the first temple in Jerusalem (see Josephus, 'Wars,' 5:1); but in this, perhaps, lay a special significance, since, as the city-like temple stood in no need of walls and bulwarks for defense, the lowness of its walls would permit it the more easily to be seen, would, in fact, make it a conspicuous object to all who might approach it for worship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The east gate. The gate which looketh toward the east; literally, whose face was toward the east. That this was not the gate in which the angel had been first observed standing seems implied in the statement that he came to it. That he began with it is satisfactorily accounted for by remembering that the east gate was the principal entrance, and stood directly in front of the porch of the temple proper. The same reasons will explain the fullness of description accorded to it rather than to the others. It was ascended by stairs, or steps, of which the number seven is omitted, though it is mentioned in connection with the north (ver. 22) and south (ver. 26) gates. \"The significance was obvious,\" writes Plumptre. \"Men must ascend in heart and mind as they enter the sanctuary, and the seven steps represented the completeness at last of that ascension.\" The steps lay outside the wall, and at their head had a threshold (סַפ, properly an \"expansion,\" or \"spreading out\") one reed broad, i.e. measuring inwards from east to west, the thickness of the wall. Its extension from south to north, afterwards stated, was ten cubits, or fifteen feet (ver. 11). The last clause, improperly rendered, and the other threshold (Authorized and Revised Versions), or \"the back threshold\" (Ewald), of the gate which was one reed, should be translated, even one threshold (Revised Version margin), or the first threshold, as distinguished from the second, to be afterwards specified (ver. 7); comp. Genesis h 5, \"the first (one) day.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And every little chamber. Proceeding inward beneath a covered porch, the exact width of the gate and threshold, i.e. ten cubits, the prophet's guide, after having passed the threshold, conducted him to a series of lodges, תָּאִיִם, or \"guard-chambers,\" six in number, three on each side (ver. 10), one reed or six cubits square, roofed (ver. 11), and separated from each other by a space of five cubits square, open overhead and closed towards the north or south as the case might be by a side wall. These \"lodges,\" or \"cells,\" were intended for the Levite sentinels who kept guard over the house (see Ezekiel 44:11, 14; and comp. 1 Kings 14:28; 2 Chronicles 12:11). Beyond the cells stretched the threshold of the gate by the porch (Hebrew, אוּלָם; the LXX., αἰλάμ: Vulgate, vestibulum, \"a portico\") of the gate within; literally, from the house; i.e. the gate fronting one coming from the temple, hence the gate looking \"towards the house.\" מֵהַבַּיִת, \"from the house,\" does not qualify the threshold as if to indicate that this was an interior threshold in contrast to the former, or exterior, but \"the gate,\" its intention being to state that the porch in front of which extended the second \"threshold\" was the vestibule or portico before the gate which conducted inwards towards the temple, or on which one first stepped on his way from the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The divergent measurements of this porch, which are given in these verses, led the LXX. and the Vulgate to reject ver. 8 as spurious, and it is certainly wanting in some Hebrew manuscripts. Hitzig, Ewald, and Smend have accordingly expunged it from the text - an altogether unnecessary proceeding. The seeming discrepancy may be removed by supposing either, with Kliefoth, that ver. 8 furnishes the measurement of the porch from east to west, and ver. 9 its measurement from north to south, with the measurements in addition of the posts (אֵלִים, from אַיִל, \"a ram,\" hence anything curved or twisted), i.e. pillars or jambs; or, with Keil, that ver. 8 states the depth from east to west, and ver. 9 the length from north to south. The \"posts,\" which were sixty cubits high (ver. 14), were two cubits square at the base.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Having reached the furthest limit westward, the guide retraces his steps backward in an easterly direction, noting that on the side of the covered way opposite to that already examined the same arrangements existed as to \"lodges\" and \"posts,\" the latter of which (אֵילִים) are here first mentioned in connection with the guardrooms, and must be understood as signifying pillars or jambs in front of the walls. Their measurements, which were equal, were probably as in ver. 9, two cubits square.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The breadth of the entry (literally, opening) of the gate, ten cubits. Obviously this measurement was taken from north to south of the gate-entrance (ver. 6), and represented the whole breadth of the doorway and the threshold, or one-fifth of the entire length of the gate-building. The second portion of the verse, the length of the gate thirteen cubits, is explained by Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, Keil (with whom Plumptre agrees), as signifying the length of the covered way from the east entrance, since it is supposed the whole length of forty cubits (the length of the gate without the porch) would hardly be roofed in; so that assuming a similar covered way of thirteen cubits at the other end of the gate-building, as one came \"from the house,\" there would be an open space, well, or uncovered courtyard, of fourteen cubits in length and six broad, enclosed on all sides by gate-buildings. The roofs extending from the east and west would be supported on the \"posts\" of the chambers mentioned in ver. 10. Smend, however, infers, from the windows in the posts within the gate (ver. 16), that the whole extent was roofed in, and accordingly can offer no explanation of the clause; Kliefoth and Schroder prefer to regard the thirteen cubits as the height of the gate, although the word translated \"length\" never elsewhere has this meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The space also before the little chambers; more correctly, and a border before the ledges. Though the construction of this border, fence, or barrier (comp. Ezekiel 27:4; Ezekiel 43:13, 17; Exodus 19:12) is not described, its design most likely was to enable the guardsman, by stepping beyond his coil, to observe what was going on in the gate without either interrupting or being interrupted by the passengers. As the barrier projected one cubit on each side of the ten-cubit way, only eight cubits remained for persons going in or out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The breadth of the gate from the roof of one little chamber or lodge to another, measuring from door to door, was five and twenty cubits, which were thus made up: 10 cubits of footway + 12 (2 × 6) cubits for the two guard-rooms + 3 (2 × say 1.5) cubits for the thickness of the two side walls = 25 cubits in all. According to ver. 42, the length of a hewn stone was one cubit and a half. The doors from which the measurements were taken must have been in the side walls at the back of the guard- looms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He made also posts. In using the verb \"made\" the prophet either went back in thought to the time when the man who then explained the building had fashioned it (Hengstenberg); or he employed the term in the sense of constituit, i.e. fixed or estimated, \"inasmuch as such a height could not be measured from the bottom to the top with the measuring-red\" (Keil). The \"posts,\" the אֵילִים of ver. 9, were sixty cubits high, and corresponded to the towers in modern churches. To the objection sometimes urged against what is called the \"exaggerated\" height of these columns, Kliefoth replies, \"If it had been considered that our church towers have grown up out of gate-pillars, that one can see, not merely in Egyptian obelisks and Turkish minarets, but also in our own hollow factory chimneys, how upon a base of two cubits, square pillars of sixty cubits high can be erected, and that finally the talk is of a colossal building seen in vision, no critical difficulties would have been discovered in this statement as to height.\" The last clause, even unto the post of the court round about the gate, should read, and the court reached unto the post (אַיִל being used collectively), the gate being round about (Revised Version); or, the court round about the gate reached to the pillars (Keil); or, at the pillar the court was round about the gate (Kliefoth). The sense is, that the court lay round about the inner egress from the gate. The Authorized Version, with which Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' agrees, thinks of an inner hall between the porch of the gate and the two most western guard-chambers, round the sides of which the sixty-cubit columns stood. Ewald, following the corrupt text of the LXX., translates, \"And the threshold of the outer vestibule twenty cubits, the gate court abutting on the chambers round about.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The whole length of the gate, from the outer entrance to the inner exit fifty cubits, was thus composed -NEWLINENEWLINE1.

One post, or pillar - 2 cubitsNEWLINENEWLINETotal - 50 cubitsNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And there were narrow (Hebrew, closed) windows, probably of lattice-work, so fixed as to prevent either egress or ingress. That these \"windows\" (חַלּ ונות, so called from being perforated) were intended to impart light to the gateway, either in whole or in part, is apparent, though it is difficult to form a clear idea of how they were situated. They were in the chambers, and in their posts and in the arches, or colonnades (Revised Version margin). In the chambers, or \"lodges,\" they were most likely in the back walls, and in or near the posts, or pillars, belonging to the doors of these chambers, the clause, \"and in their posts,\" being regarded as epexegetic of the preceding, and designed to furnish a more precise explanation of the particular part of the guard-room in which the windows were. Similar windows existed in the Solomonic temple (1 Kings 6:4). The \"arches,\" or \"colonnades\" (אֵלַ מּיִת), were probably wall-projections on the sides of the chambers, to that light was admitted from three sides. Thus to one standing within, the whole gateway appeared studded round and round with windows. The description of the gate closes with the statement that upon each post were palm trees, which may signify either that the shaft was fashioned like a palm tree, as is sometimes seen in ancient buildings in the East (Dr. Currey, Plumptre) or that it was ornamented with representations of palm branches or palm trees (Keil, Ewald, Kliefoth). Hengstenberg's idea, that \"whole palms beside the pillars are meant,\" is favored by Smend, who cites, in addition to ver. 26, Ezekiel 41:18, etc., and 1 Kings 6:29; 1 Kings 7:36.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-19. - The outer court. Emerging from the doorway inwards, the prophet, accompanied by his celestial guide, stepped into the outward court, i.e. the area surrounding the temple buildings. There the first thing observed was that chambers and a pavement ran round the court. The chambers were cells, or rooms - לִשָׁכות always signifying single rooms in a building (see Ezekiel 42:1; 1 Chronicles 9:26) - whose dimensions, exact sites, and uses are not specified, though, as they were thirty in number, it is probable they were arranged on the east, north, and south sides of the court, five upon each side of the gate, and standing somewhat apart from each other; that they were large enough to contain as many as thirty persons (see 1 Samuel 9:22; and comp. Jeremiah 35:2); and that they were designed for sacrificial meals and such-like purposes (see Ezekiel 44:1, etc.). In pre-exilic times such halls had been occupied by distinguished person s connected with the temple service (see Ezekiel 8:8-12; 2 Kings 23:11; Jeremiah 35:4, etc.; Jeremiah 36:10; Ezra 10:6). The pavement was a tessellated floor (comp. Esther 1:6; 2 Chronicles 7:3), which ran round the court and was named the lower pavement, to distinguish it from that laid in the inner court which stood at a higher elevation than the outer. As another note of position, it is stated to have been by the side (literally, shoulder) of the gates over against - or, answerable to (Revised Version) - the length of the gates. This can only mean that the breadth of the pavement was fifty cubits (the length of the gates, ver. 15) less six cubits (the thickness of the wall, ver. 5), or forty-four cubits, and that it ran along the inner length of the wall on either side of the gates. The breadth of the court from the forefront of the lower gate, i.e. from the inner end of the east gate or the edge of the pavement, unto the forefront of the inner court without was an hundred cubits. Whether the measurement was up to the wall of the inner court, within which, on this hypothesis, its gate must have wholly lain, or only up to the door of the inner court, which, on this understanding, must have projected beyond its wall, is obscure. The first interpretation derives support from the circumstance that the terminus ad quem of the measurement is said to have been, not the inner gate, but the inner court; while the second finds countenance in the use of the preposition מִחוּצ, which seems to indicate that the measuring proceeded from the western extremity of the outer gate to the eastern extremity of the inner gate, and appears to be confirmed by vers. 23 and 27, as well as by the consideration that in this way the symmetry of the building would be better preserved than by making the outer gate project into the court and the inner gate lie wholly within the inner wall. In this way the hundred cubits marked the distance between the extremities of the gates, the whole breadth of the court being two hundred cubits, i.e. a hundred cubits between the gates, with two gates' lengths of fifty cubits each added. The same measurements applied to the north gate, which the seer next approached.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-23. - The north gate. This was in all respects similar to that upon the east, though its description proceeds in the reverse order, beginning with the three \"chambers,\" or lodges, on each side of the footway (ver. 21), going on to the \"posts,\" \"arches,\" and \"windows,\" and ending with the outside steps, seven in number (ver. 22), which are here first mentioned in connection with the gates. Its dimensions were the same as those of the \"first\" gate, fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.

Verses 28-31. - The south gate of the inner court. The construction and measurements of this corresponded with those of the gates in the outer court, with only two points of difference, viz. that it possessed a flight of eight steps instead of seven, and that the arches, or wall-projections, were toward the outer court. The difference in the number of the steps was doubtless of symbolic significance, and pointed not only to the higher sanctity in general which attached to the inner court, but to the truth that, as one approached the dwelling-place of Jehovah, an increasing measure and degree of holiness were demanded - what Plumptre styles \"an ever-ascending sursum corda.\" The seven steps of the outer door added to the eight steps of this amount to fifteen, with which corresponds the number of the pilgrim-psalms (Psalm 120-134.), which are supposed to have been sung, one upon each step, by the choir of Levites as they ascended first into the outer and then into the inner court. The statement that the wall-projections were towards the outer court showed that, in walking through the inner gateway, one would reverse the order of the outer gate, i.e. would first pass through the porch, then cross the threshold to the guard-rooms, next step upon the second threshold, and finally enter the inner court.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32-34. - The east gate of the inner court.

Three things demand attention - the cells for washing, the tables for slaughtering, and the hooks. Verse 38. - The chambers. As the verse explains, these were different from the guard-rooms in the gates (vers. 7, 21) and the chambers on the pavement (ver. 17), although the same Hebrew word is employed to designate the latter. The cells under consideration were expressly designed for washing \"the inwards and the legs\" of the victims brought for sacrifice (Leviticus 1:9). Whether such a cell stood at each of the three gates, as the plural seems to indicate, although described only in connection with the north (Keil, Kliefoth, Plumptre), or merely at one gate, and that the north - because, according to the Law (Leviticus 1:11; Leviticus 6:18; Leviticus 7:2), on the north side of the altar burnt, sin, and trespass offerings were to be killed (Havernick, Hengstenberg) - or the east, which is alluded to in vet, s. 39, 40 (Hitzig, Ewald, Smend), is controverted, though the former view seems the preferable, seeing that, according to Ezekiel 46:1, 2, the priests were to prepare burnt offerings and peace offerings for the prince at the posts of the east gate. The situation of the cells is stated to have been by (or, beside) the posts of (i.e. at) the gates (see on ver. 14), but on which side of the gates, whether near the right or left pillar, no information is furnished. Keil and Kliefoth place those at the south and north gates on the west side; that at the east gate Keil locates on its north side, Kliefoth placing one in the side wall at each side of the gate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 39-42. - The tables. These were twelve in number, of which eight were used for slaughtering purposes, i.e. either for slaying the sacrifices or for laying upon them the carcasses of the slaughtered victims; and the remaining four for depositing thereon the instruments employed in killing the animals. Of the eight, four stood within the porch of the gate, two on each side, and four without - two on the side as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate; rather, at the shoulder to one going up to the gate opening towards the north, i.e. on the outside of the porch north wall; and two on the other side or shoulder, i.e. on the outside of the porch south wall. This determines the gate in question to have been, not the north gate, as the Authorized Version has conjectured, but the east gate, whose side walls looked towards the north and south. The third quaternion of tables appears to have been planted at the steps, presumably two on' each side, i.e. if with Kliefoth, Keil, and Schroder, לָעולָה be translated \"at the ascent,\" or \"going up,\" i.e. at the staircase (comp. ver. 26). If, however, with the Authorized and Revised Versions, Ewald, Hengstenberg, Smend, and others, לָעולָה be read \"for the burnt offering,\" then the exact position of the tables is left undetermined, though in any case they must have been near the slaughtering-tables. As they were designed for heavy instruments, they were constructed of hewn stones a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; from which it may be argued the eight previously mentioned were made of wood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFour tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - The hooks. The word שְׁפַתַּיִם occurs again only in Psalm 68:13, where it signifies \"sheepfolds,\" or \"stalls;\" its older form (מִשְׁפְתַיִם) appearing in Genesis 49:14 and Judges 5:16. As this sense is unsuitable, recourse must be had to its derivation (from שָׁפַת, \"to put, set, or fix\"), which suggests as its import here either, as Ewald, Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Havernick, and Smend, following the LXX. and Vulgate, prefer, \"ledges,\" or \"border guards,\" on the edge of the tables, to keep the instruments or flesh from falling off; or, as Kimchi, Gesenius, Furst, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre, after the Chaldean paraphrast, explain, \"pegs\" fastened in the wall for hanging the slaughtered caresses before they were flayed. In favor of the first meaning stand the facts that the second clause of this verse speaks of\" tables,\" not of \"walls,\" and that the measure of the shephataim is one of breadth rather than of length; against it are the considerations that the dual form, shephataim, fits better to a forked peg than to a double border, and that the shephataim are stated to have been fastened \"in the house\" (ba-baith), which again suits the idea of a peg fastened in the outer wall of the porch, rather than of a border fixed upon a table. The last clause of this verse is rendered by Ewald, after the LXX., \"and over the tables\" (obviously those standing outside of the porch) \"were covers to protect them from rain and from drought;\" and it is conceivable that coverings might have been advantageous for both the wooden tables and the officiating priests; only the Hebrew must be changed before it can yield this rendering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 44-46. - The chambers of the ringers According to ver. 44, these, of which the number is not recorded, were situated in the inner court, outside of the inner gate, at the side of the north gate, and looked towards the south, one only being located at the side of the east gate with a prospect towards the north. Interpreted in this way, they cannot have been the same as the \"priests' chambers\" mentioned in vers. 45, 46, though these also looked in the same direction. The language, however, seems to indicate that they were the same, and on this hypothesis it is difficult to understand how they should be called \"the chambers of the singers,\" and at the same time be assigned to the priests, \"the keepers of the charge of the house\" and \"the keepers of the charge of the altar.\" Hengstenberg. Kliefoth, Schroder, and others hold that Ezekiel purposed to suggest that in the vision-temple before him the choral service was no longer to be left exclusively in the hands of the Levites as it had been in the Solomonic temple (1 Chronicles 6:33-47; 1 Chronicles 15:17; 2 Chronicles 20:19), but that the priests were to participate therein. Dr. Currey imagines the chambers may have been occupied in common by the singers and the priests when engaged on duty at the temple. The LXX. text reads, \"And he led me unto the inner court, and behold two chambers in the inner court, one at the back of the gate which looks towards the north, and bearing towards the south, and one at the back of the gate which looks towards the south, and bearing towards the north;\" and in accordance with this Rosenmüller, Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend propose sundry emendations on the Hebrew text. Since, however, it cannot be certified that the LXX. did not paraphrase or mistranslate the present rather than follow a different text, it is safer to abide by the renderings of the Authorized and Revised Versions. Yet one cannot help feeling that the LXX. translation has the merit of clearness and simplicity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. Under the Law the Levite families of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari had the charge of the tabernacle and all its belongings (Numbers 3:25, etc.); but of these Levites who kept the charge of the sanctuary, Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest had the oversight. Hence the priests alluded to by Ezekiel as the keepers of the charge of the house were most likely those who superintended the Levites in the execution of their tasks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - The keepers of the charge of the altar. These formed another body of priests, whose duties generally were to officiate in the temple-worship, and more specifically to sacrifice and burn incense upon the altars (Leviticus 1-6.). Under the Law the priests were all descendants of Aaron (Exodus 27:20, 21; Exodus 28:1-4; Exodus 29:9, 44; Exodus 40:15). By David these were divided into two classes - the sons of Eleazar, at the head of whom stood Zadok; and the sons of Ithamar, with Ahimelech as their chief (1 Chronicles 24:3). In the vision-temple the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi have the sole right of drawing near to the Lord to minister unto him (see on Ezekiel 43:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - He measured the court... and the altar. The dimensions of the former, the open space in front of the temple, alone are given - a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits broad; those of the latter, which stood before the \"house,\" and occupied the center of the square, are afterwards recorded (Ezekiel 43:13). The distance from north to south of the inner court being a hundred cubits, if to these be added twice two hundred cubits, the space between the outer court wall and that of the inner court, the result will give five hundred cubits as the breadth of the outer court, from north gate to south gate. Then as the length of the inner court was a hundred cubits, if to these be added first the hundred cubits lying before the inner court towards the east, secondly, the hundred cubits covered by the temple (Ezekiel 41:13, 14), and thirdly, the one hundred cubits which extended behind the temple (Ezekiel 41:13, 14), the total will amount to five hundred cubits for the length of the outer court from east to west. The outer court, therefore, like the inner, was a square.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 48, 49. - With these verses the following chapter ought to have commenced, as the seer now advances to a description of the house, or temple proper, as in 1 Kings 6:2, with its three parts - a porch (vers. 48, 49), a holy place (Ezekiel 41:1), and a holy of holies (Ezekiel 41:4). Verse 48. - The porch, or vestibule, according to Keil, appears to have been entered by a folding door of two leaves, each three cubits broad, which were attached to two side pillars five cubits broad, and met in the middle, so that the whole breadth of the porch front was six cubits, or, including the posts, sixteen cubits. The measurements in ver. 49 of the length of the porch (from east to west) twenty cubits, and the breadth (from north to south) eleven cubits, he harmonizes with this view by assuming that the pillars, which were five cubits bread in front, were only half that breadth in the inside, the side wall dividing it in two, so that, although to one entering the opening was only six cubits, the moment one stood in the interior it was 6 cubits + 2 × 2.5 cubits = 11 cubits. Kliefoth, however, rejects this explanation, and understands the three cubits to refer to the portion of the entrance on either side which was closed by a gate, perhaps of lattice-work, leaving for the ingress and egress of priests a passage of five cubits. In this view the whole front of the porch would he 5 cubits of passage + 6 (2 × 3) cubits of lattice-work + 10 (2 × 5) cubits of pillar, equal in all to 21 cubits. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' includes the three cubits of door in the five cubits of post, and, supposing the temple entrance to be ten cubits, makes the whole front to have been twenty cubits. We prefer Kliefoth's opinion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel40:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Like the gates into the courts, the temple porch was entered by steps, of which the number is not stated, though, after the LXX., it is usually assumed to have been ten, Hengstenberg suggesting fourteen. The last particular noted, that there were pillars by the posts, has been explained to signify that upon the posts, or bases, stood shafts or pillars (Currey), or with more probability that by or near the pillars rose columns (Keil, Kliefoth). The height of these is not given, though Hengstenberg again finds it in the elevation of the porch of Solomon's temple - a hundred and twenty cubits (2 Chronicles 3:4). Their exact position is not stated; but they were probably, like Jachin and Boaz in the Solomonic temple, stationed one on each side of the steps.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.41":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The temple. הַהֵיכָל frequently applied to the whole building (2 Kings 24:13; 2 Chronicles 3:17; Jeremiah 1:28; Haggai 2:15; Zechariah 6:14, 15), is here used of the nave of the temple, the holy place, as distinguished from the holy of holies (comp. 1 Kings 6:5, 17; 1 Kings 7:50). Schroder alone of commentators holds by the extended meaning. The measuring began from the east wall of the holy place. The posts (אֵילִים), as in Ezekiel 40:9, the corner pillars on each side of the entrance, measured six cubits broad, whereas those of the porch measured only five (Ezekiel 40:48). The phrase, The breadth of the tabernacle; or, the tent (הָאהֶל), has occasioned difficulty. Hitzig, Ewald, and Smend propose to substitute for הַאֹהָל the word הָאָיִל (\"post\"), which might in itself be unobjectionable, only no such device is required to render the clause intelligible. It is sufficient to understand the phrase as signifying that the measurements noted had a special relation to the entire breadth of the temple, here styled \"tabernacle,\" or \"tent,\" to indicate the covered portion of the edifice, which, in this respect, and in respect of its being the place of meeting between Jehovah and Israel, resembled the ancient sanctuary of the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The breadth of the door, i.e. of the opening from the porch, was ten cubits; whereas the door into the porch was eleven cubits (Ezekiel 40:49). This would have the effect of rendering the door into the holy place more conspicuous. The sides (or, shoulders) of the door - according to Kliefoth, \"the side walls,\" from the door to the corner pillars; according to Keil, the shoulders lay behind the pillars - were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other; i.e. were as broad as the posts of the porch. The length of the holy place, forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty, were the same as in the Solomonic structure. The entire frontage of the holy place was 20 cubits of interior breadth + 12 (2 x 6) cubits, as breadth of pillars - 32 cubits; or, otherwise, 6 + 6, for the two pillars, 5 + 5 for the sides, and 10 for the door opening = 32 cubits in all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Then went he inward; i.e. into the most holy place. As this could not be entered even by a priest, but only by the high priest once a year (Exodus 30:10; Leviticus 16:17; Hebrews 9:7), Ezekiel was left without, while \"the man\" announced to him in succession the measurements of the adytum, as these were taken. First, that of the post of the door (the singular for the plural, meaning the post on either side of the doorway) two cubits. Next, that of the door itself, which is given first as six and second as seven cubits. Kliefoth and Keil take the six as the height and the seven as the breadth of the entrance into the holy of holies; but as no other measurement of height occurs throughout this description, Dr. Currey regards \"six\" as the distance from \"pest\" to \"post,\" and \"seven\" as the actual width of the door, each post projecting half a cubit beyond the hinge of the door, which opened inward. Ewald and Villalpandus, after the LXX., read, \"the entrance six cubits and the flanks of the entrance seven cubits;\" and these figures, 7 + 6 4- 7, certainly make up the breadth of the interior; only it is impossible to extract this meaning from the Hebrew without tampering with the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The holy of holies was an exact square of twenty cubits, as in the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 6:20), and to the measuring-man, who had turned himself round, lay along the whole breadth of the temple or holy place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11. - The wall and side buildings. Verse 5. - The measuring commenced with the wall of the house, i.e. with the outer wall, which, beginning at the pillars (ver. 1), enclosed the temple on its south, west, and north sides. Its great thickness, six cubits, corresponded with and even surpassed the colossal proportions of architecture in the ancient East. The walls of Solomon's temple, though not mentioned in either Kings or Chronicles, could hardly have been less than four cubits thick (see 1 Kings 6:6), and were probably more (Schurer). Like the Solomonic (1 Kings 6:5-10), the Ezekelian temple had side chambers, which, like those of the earlier building, served as storehouses for priests' clothing, temple utensils, and temple treasures (1 Kings 7:51; 2 Kings 11:2; 2 Chronicles 5:1), and measured four cubits broad in the clear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; literally, side chamber over side chamber, three and thirty times; which means that they were ranged in three stories of thirty each; in this, again, agreeing, as to number and position, with the chambers in Solomon's temple (see Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:03. 2). It is not needful to alter the text, as Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, and Ewald propose to do, in order to make it read, with the LXX., \"chamber against chamber, thirty and (this) three times,\" on the ground that אֵל and not עַל is the preposition, because in Ezekiel אֵל often stands for עַל (Ezekiel 18:6; Ezekiel 31:12; Ezekiel 40:2). How the chambers were arranged along the three sides is not stated; but most likely there were twelve threes on each of the longer sides, the north and the south, and six threes on the shorter or western side. Like the chambers in Solomon's temple (1 Kings 6:6). those in Ezekiel's were not fastened to \"the wall of the house,\" i.e. of the temple proper; the only question is whether they were built against the temple wall, as Kliefoth, Keil, Smend, and Schroder suppose, or, as Ewald and Dr. Currey seem to think, against another wall, five cubits thick (ver. 9), which ran parallel to the temple wall, and which, having been built expressly for the support of the side chambers, might properly enough be said to be \"of the house,\" i.e. belonging to it. In the former case the chambers would doubtless be fastened to the temple wall by means of \"ledges,\" \"holds,\" \"rebates,\" as in the temple of Solomon: in the latter case, as Ewald translates, there would be \"a light passage between the wall of the house and the side chambers around.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In the side chambers an enlarging took place as they went up, i.e. the floorage of the second story exceeded that of the first, and the floorage of the third that of the second; though how this was effected can only be conjectured. If the chambers were built against the temple wall, then probably the wall at each story went in, say a cubit or a cubit and a half from the outside, so as to admit the beams; or, if the chambers were built against an outside wall, a similar recession of the wall from the inside may have taken place. In either ease, the (interior) breadth of the house, i.e. of the side chambers, would be upward, and would increase from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. Plumptre, after Kliefoth, suggests that the increasing size of the chambers in the three stories may have been due to projecting galleries. Ewald, taking \"house\" as \"the temple,\" supposes that it gradually became bigger. i.e. broader, as it rose, which could be the case only if the side chambers were built against the temple wall, and the increased width of the stories was scoured By projecting galleries or corridors. Greater obscurity attaches to the second clause, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers, which the Authorized Version and some expositors regard as an indication that Ezekiel's temple had a spiral staircase like that in Solomon's temple (see 1 Kings 6:8); and probably some such mode of passing from story to story did exist in Ezekiel's temple; yet the clause, when properly rendered, does not refer to this. The Revised Version reads, \"And the side chambers were broader as they encompassed the house higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house continued upward; and so one went up (most likely by a spiral stair) from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8 explains that \"the house\" did not stand upon the level ground, but, like many temple buildings in antiquity (see Schurer, in Riehm's 'Handworterbuch,' art. \"Tern. pel Salerno\"), upon a height - or, raised basement (Revised Version) - round about, which agrees with the statement in Ezekiel 40:49 that the temple was approached by means of a stair. In consequence of this, the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits; or, of six cubits to the joining (Revised Version); \"six cubits to the story\" (Ewald); literally, six cubits to the armpit. This can hardly mean six cubits each equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, which would be a new definition of the length of the reed; but as Havernick and Kliefoth propose, must be taken as an architectural term indicative of the point where one portion of the building joined on to another. Accordingly, by most interpreters the six cubits are considered to be a statement of the height of the ceiling above the floor in each story, which would give an elevation of eighteen cubits for the three stories; but probably they mark only the height of the temple and side chamber basis above the ground. Kliefoth includes both views, and obtains an altitude of twenty-four cubits from the ground to the temple roof.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers on the outside, is next mentioned as having been five cubits, i.e. the same as the breadth of the wall of the porch (Ezekiel 40:48), but one cubit thinner than that of the temple (ver. 5). The clause which follows is obscure. By that which was left, the Authorized and Revised Versions understand the place of the side chambers that were within - or, that belonged to the house (Revised Version) - without intending to assert that the whole space left, which was five cubits (ver. 11), was occupied by the side chambers, which were only four cubits broad (ver. 5). Accepting these measurements, Kliefoth and Keil regard the free space as a walk of five cubits broad on the outside of the side chambers. Ewald, and Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' place the five cubits between the temple wall and the side chambers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ewald and Smend, following the LXX., combine vers.; 9 and 10 thus: \"And that which was left between the side chambers of the house and the cells (along the inner court wall) was twenty cubits round about the house on every side.\" Interpreters who reject this combination of the verses explain ver. 10 as a statement of the distance between the outside wall of the side chambers and the cells of the inner court. Between the two lay the wideness of twenty cubits; i.e. a free space of such breadth on the north, south, and west sides of the house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The place that was left has been differently explained (see above on ver. 9); but on any hypothesis the side chambers opened on the free space towards the north and towards the south, g.s. one row of chambers was entered by a door from the south, another by a door from the north. The corridor into which the chambers opened - whether between them and the house (Ewald, Currey) or between them and an outside wall (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Keil) - was five cubits broad. Thus the whole breadth of the temple court can be obtained.NEWLINENEWLINEI. The breadth of the court -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Breadth of the house 20 cubitsNEWLINENEWLINE2.

Verse 12. - The building that was before the separate place. The word הַגּזְרָה, occurring only in this chapter, and translated \"separate place,\" is derived from a root signifying to \"cut off,\" and here denotes a space behind the temple on the west, which was marked off from the rest of the ground on which the temple with its courts and chambers stood, and devoted most likely to less sacred purposes. Behind Solomon's temple lay a similar space (2 Kings 23:11; 1 Chronicles 26:18), with buildings upon it and a separate way out; and as the name gizrah appears to convey the notion of something that required to be kept apart and removed from the sacred precincts, the opinion of Kliefoth is probably correct that \"this space with its buildings was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, and that this was the reason why it received the name of 'the separate place.'

Its whole length was ninety plus ten, or a hundred cubits. The entire area was thus once more a hundred cubits square.

Starting from the gizrah, or separate place, this summary mentions that the \"man\" measuredNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the whole length of the erection;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the length of its \"galleries\" on the north and south sides; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the inner temple with the porches of the court.NEWLINENEWLINEThe length of the separate place is not stated, that having been already done (ver. 13). The length of the galleries is specified as a hundred cubits, which shows they extended along the whole side of the building. As for the nature of these \"galleries,\" or אַתִּקִים, nothing can be ascertained from the derivation of the word. The LXX. renders it in this verse by ἀπόλοιπα (\"things left over\"), in Ezekiel 42:3 and 5 by περίσυλα and στοαί: the Vulgate has here ethecas, the Hebrew Latinized, and in Ezekiel 42. portions. The ethekim were most likely passages or perches running along both (north and south) sides of the building, and supported either by pillars or ledges in the wall. The inner temple, which was measured, was the \"house\" which stood between the gizrah and the inner court; the porches of the court were the gate buildings in the inner and outer courts. Of all these the dimensions have already been reported, and are not again rehearsed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17 introduce several new details.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That the door-posts (rather, thresholds), and the narrow (or, closed) windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, were covered with a wainscoting of wood from the ground up to the windows.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That the windows, whether openings on the first floor (Kliefoth) or skylights in the roof (Hengstenberg), were \"covered,\" which may signify, as Ewald and Plumptre think, that they were not left open, but protected by a lattice-work of bars or planks; or, as Currey suggests, that they were wainscoted as well as the space from the ground to the windows.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) That nothing was constructed by caprice or at random, but that all about the building proceeded by exact measurement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - As in Solomon's temple (1 Kings 6:29), the wainscoting was adorned with artistic carving of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree and a cherub standing alternately. Each cherub had two of its four faces exhibited (since four could not be conveniently represented on a plain surface) - a man's face (symbolizing the rational creation) directed towards the palm tree on one side, and a young lion's face (symbolizing the irrational creation) turned towards the palm tree on the other side. This particular style of ornamentation was employed from the ground unto above the door, which Plumptre interprets as an indication of the height of the palm trees and cherubic figures, but which probably meant the same thing as the preceding clause, \"through- all the house round about.\" Cherubic figures formed part of the adornment of the tabernacle curtains (Exodus 26:1; Exodus 36:8). (On the nature of the cherubim and their symbolic significance, see Ezekiel 1:5-10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The posts of the temple were squared; literally, as for the temple the doorposts were squared, or \"the sanctuary post work of square form\" (Keil). The remaining clauses ought to read as in the Revised Version, \"As for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance thereof was as the appearance of the temple,\" the sanctuary being the holy of holies as distinguished from the holy place or the house as a whole, The precise force of the last words, the appearance as the appearance, is supposed by Kliefoth and Keil to be that the sanctuary door, like that of the temple, had square pests; by Ewald, that it appeared to be what it really was; by Plumptre, that the appearance was like that he (Ezekiel) had formerly described: by Currey, that the appearance in this vision was the same as in the other visions, and as in the actual temple (comp. Ezekiel 43:2). Something can be said for each of these attempts to elucidate a dark phrase. Smend and Hitzig, follow the LXX. in connecting the last clause of ver. 21 with ver. 22 in this fashion, \"And in front of the holy place was an appearance like the sight of a wooden altar.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The altar. This was the altar of incense (Exodus 30:1, etc.), which stood in the holy place in contradistinction to the altar of burnt offering, which was located in the outer court. The altar of burnt offering in Solomon's temple was of brass (2 Chronicles 4:1), and in the tabernacle of shittim wood (Exodus 27:1); the altar of incense in the tabernacle (Exodus 30:1) and in Solomon's temple (1 Kings 7:48) was constructed of wood overlaid with gold, but in this temple only of wood. Plumptre, commenting on this, writes, \"Possibly Ezekiel shared the feelings of Daniel (Daniel 9:25), that the rebuilding would be 'in troublous times,' and did not contemplate an abundance of gold as likely to be the outcome of the scant offerings of an impoverished people.\" The dimensions of this altar in the tabernacle were two cubits high and one cubit long and broad; in the Solomonic temple, though not stated, they were probably the same as in the tabernacle; in Ezekiel's temple they were three cubits high, two cubits long (and probably two cubits broad). The corners of the altar were most likely \"the horns, or horn-shaped points projecting at the cornets.\" The length. Ewald, Keil, Smend, and others, after the LXX., change into \"base,\" \"stand,\" or \"pedestal,\" on the ground that the length has been already mentioned, and that one does not usually speak of a length being of wood; but it does not strike one as peculiarly objectionable to say that the altar had corner pieces, a length, and walls (or sides) of wood, meaning thereby to intimate that it was wholly constructed of timber. When the prophet's attention had been directed to it, the guide who accompanied him observed, This is the table that is before the Lord, not because, as Bottcher conjectured, the altar was regarded as including the table of showbread, but because in the Law the offerings laid upon the altar had been spoken of as the bread of God (see Leviticus 26:6, 8, 17, 21, 22; and comp. Malachi 1:7); and because in this vision table and altar appear to be used inter-changeably (see Ezekiel 44:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-26. - The doors of the temple and of the sanctuary form the next subject for description. Again as in the Solomonic edifice (1 Kings 6:31, etc.), the holy place and the holy of holies had two doors; i.e. each had one door composed of two turning (or, folding) leaves, ornamented, like the walls of the house, with carvings of cherubim and palms. On the face of the porch without were thick planks, by which Ewald understands \"foliage\" or \"leafwork,\" but which, with greater likelihood, were either as Keil renders, \"moldings of wood\" for the threshold; or \"cornicings,\" as Kliefoth translates; if not, as Smend suggests, projecting beams to afford shelter to one standing in the porch; or as Hengstenberg and Plumptre say, \"steps.\" The last verse states that narrow or closed (as in ver. 16) windows admitted light into the porch, while carvings of palm trees adorned its walls on each side. The cherubic figures, Plumptre hints, were absent, because the porch was a place of less sanctity than the temple. Hengstenberg notes that the words, \"thick planks,\" \"thick beams,\" or \"steps,\" as he translates, fitly close this description, \"as placing the extreme east over against the extreme west with which it began.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel41:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.42":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-14. - The priests' chambers. Verse 1. - The survey of the house having been completed, the seer was conducted by his guide into the outer court (see on Ezekiel 40:17), by the way toward the north, i.e. by the inner north gate (see Ezekiel 40:23) and from the outer court into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. That this chamber, or these chambers (לִשְׁכָּה being a collective noun, though in vers. 4 and 5 it occurs in the plural), were not the same cells as those mentioned in Ezekiel 40:17, 44, as Havernick supposes, is apparent from their situation and use. Those in Ezekiel 40:44 were in the inner, while these were in the outer; and if the cells spoken of in Ezekiel 40:17 were in the outer court, they were also on the pavement by the outer wall, while the chambers now alluded to were \"over against,\" or in front of, the gizrah, or separate place (see on Ezekiel 41:12), and \"over against,\" or in front of, \"the building toward the north.\" This building Kiel, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre hold to have been the erection on the gizrah; Ewald, Kliefoth, Smend, and Currey believe it to have meant the temple. The question as to which view is correct is immaterial, since the row of chambers extended in front of parts of both buildings. Ewald, as usual, follows the LXX., and translates, \"brought me to the fifteen (another Greek text has five) cells;\" but of this the Hebrew contains nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - With this verse the Authorized and Revised Versions begin a new sentence, and are in this at one with Smend; but the majority of expositors place the second verse under the regimen of the verb, \"he brought me,\" in ver. 1, and understand the seer to state that he was planted down before the length (or, long side) of an hundred cubits, with the door toward the north, and the breadth fifty cubits. That is to say, the building which contained the sacristies, or priests' chambers, was a hundred cubits long and fifty bread. As the building on the separate place was also a hundred cubits long (Ezekiel 41:13), it might seem as if this erection ran exactly parallel to that, and this view is taken by Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre; but Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, on the authority of Ezekiel 46:19, locate a priests' kitchen behind the priests' chambers towards the west, and reserve for it forty cubits, on the plausible ground that it would not likely be smaller in size than the sacrificial kitchen for the people (see Ezekiel 46:22). Hence, if the building under consideration began forty cubits east of the gizrah wall, it would extend twenty cubits over the end and along the length of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOver against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Considerable difficulty attaches to the words of this verse. The twenty cubits which were for the inner court (better, the twenty which belonged to the inner court) have been taken by Kliefoth to signify the watchers' coils in the inner court, west of the north door (Ezekiel 40:40-46), and by Plumptre to indicate an inner area of twenty cubits square, round which the galleries in three stories ran. Both of these views, however, have this against them, that they are purely conjectural, the text in Ezekiel 40:40-46 saying nothing about twenty cubits in connection with the priests' chambers, and the text under review making no suggestion of an inner area of twenty cubits, but only of the already well-known \"inner court.\" Hence the opinion of Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, and Currey has most in its favor, that the \"twenty\" alongside of which the chamber now alluded to lay, meant the twenty cubits clear space which surrounded the temple on the south, west, and north sides (see Ezekiel 41:12-14), and which could properly be spoken of as \"for the inner court,\" rather as \"belonging to the inner court,\" since it was practically a continuation of the same. The pavement which was for (or, belonged to) the outer court, was manifestly that already described as running along the inside of the outer wall (see Ezekiel 40:17). If, as is likely, this pavement was continued along the north side of the inner court wall, then the priests' chambers must have stood upon it, and been over against it on the east side, as Currey explains; but the easier and more natural supposition is that adopted by Keil, that the second \"over against\" points to that which faced the chambers on the north, viz. the pavement, as the first marked their boundary on the south. Gallery against gallery (see on Ezekiel 41:15). In three stories; or, in the third story (Revised Version). Whether these galleries existed in each of three stories of the building, or only in the third, cannot be determined. If בַּשְּׁלִשִׁים, \"in the thirds\" occurs elsewhere only in Genesis 6:16, to denote the chambers or rooms of the third story in the ark, as Smend observes, \"the expression might also quite naturally signify three stories, one above another.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Before the chambers a walk. Whether this walk ran along the longer, i.e. northern, or in front of the eastern side of the chambers, and how it stood related to the way, which is likewise mentioned in connection with the chambers, are litigated questions. The LXX. identifies the two, and understands a way in front of the chambers of ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long. Ewald and Keil so far agree with the LXX. as to change the one cubit way into a hundred-cubit way; but whereas Ewald thinks of a passage ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long, running from west to east between two sets of chambers, Keil speaks of a walk of ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long in front of the cells, extending into a way of equal breadth and length, leading westward into the inner court. Havernick's, Hengstenberg's, and Kliefoth's idea, favored by Schroder, and probably the best, is that of a walk of ten cubits in front of the cells, and a way of one cubit leading into them from the walk. Dr. Currey reverses this, and makes a walk of ten cubits leading inward, and a way, or kerb, of one cubit in front. Plumptre agrees that the passage leading into the chambers was ten cubits broad, but regards the one cubit as denoting the thickness of the wall separating the walk from the interior of the chambers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The rendering of the Revised Version sufficiently explains this otherwise obscure verse, \"Now the upper chambers were shorter,\" or narrower, \"for the galleries took away from these;\" literally, did eat of them, \"more than from the lower and the middlemest in the building.\" In other words, the chambers rose in terrace form, each of the upper stories receding from that below it, as was customary in Babylonian architecture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6 supplies the reason for this shortening of the upper stories. The chambers had not pillars (see on Ezekiel 40:49) as the courts had. Though it is not otherwise stated, these appear to have had colonnades like these in the Herodian (Josephus, 'Aut.,' 15. 11. 5) and probably also the Solomonic temple (Acts 3:11); and hence the second and third stories required to recede in order to find supports for their respective galleries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The wall; or, fence - the Hebrew term being not חֹמָה, as in Ezekiel 40:5, or קִיר, as in Ezekiel 41:5, both of which signify the wall of a city or a building, but גָדֵר (or גֶדֶר, as in ver. 10), which means a fence or hedge, as in Ezekiel 13:5 - without, over against - or, by the side of (Revised Version) - the chambers, toward the outer court, cannot have been a rampart along the north side of-the chambers, since this was a hundred cubits long, but must have been a wall upon the side of the chambers (east or west) fencing off the outer court from the passage which led down by the side of the chambers. That this fence was on the east side is rendered probable by the circumstance that the sacrificial kitchen lay upon the west (see Ezekiel 46:19, 20), and by the statements which follow in vers. 8 and 9. The fence was doubtless intended to screen the side windows of the lower chambers from public gaze, since these were to be occupied as robing and disrobing rooms for the priests who should officiate in the temple (see ver. 14; and Ezekiel 44:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - According to the statement contained in this verse, the chambers that were in the outer court, i.e. the chambers whose windows looked into the outer court, projected fifty cubits into the outer court; i.e. this was their breadth or depth from north to south; whereas those before the temple were an hundred cubits; i.e. the chambers whose windows fronted the temple, were a hundred cubits from east to west.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The chambers were approached by an entry (in the text the entry, this being a well-known and recognized part of the structure) which ran along the east side of the building, and led from the outer to the temple court. As this (the outer) court was higher than that (the temple), and could only be reached by steps, \"the entry\" is represented as lying under the chambers. It was manifestly this \"entry\" that was screened by the fence mentioned in ver. 7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-12. - A similar suite of chambers, corresponding in every detail, is depicted as having stood upon the south side of the temple and in front of the gizrah. The only question among interpreters is whether ver. 10 relates to the north or south suite, or to an east suite. Schroder and Currey see in ver. 10 a repetition, from another point of view, of what has already been stated about the north chambers, viz. that, viewed from the outer court, they appeared in the thickness or breadth of the wall (ver. 7) and (lengthwise) over against the separate place and the buildings, i.e. the gizrah and the temple. Ewald, Smend, and Keil decide that ver. 10 forms part of the description of a south set of chambers only; but in order to make this good they alter the text by substituting הַדָּרום, \"the south,\" for הַקָּדִים, \"the east.\" Plumptre agrees with Kliefoth and Hengstenberg in holding that two similar sets of chambers are described, one on the east side and one on the south side of the inner court wall. The principal objection to this is the fact that only two suites, the north and the south, are referred to by the guide in vers. 13 and 14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - These state the uses of the chambers just described, and now named holy chambers, to denote their separation and dedication to sacred purposes. Those purposes, again, are defined as two. The chambers were to serve as dining-halls and robing rooms for the priests when they officiated in the temple. The most holy things; literally, the holy of the holies (comp. Ezekiel 41:4; Ezekiel 43:12; Ezekiel 45:3; Ezekiel 48:12; Leviticus 2:3; Leviticus 6:17, 25, 29; Leviticus 7:1, 6; Leviticus 10:12, 17; Leviticus 14:13; Leviticus 24:9; Leviticus 27:28; Numbers 18:9), signified those portions of the different sacrificial offerings which were to be eaten by the priests as the servants and representatives of Jehovah (see Keil's 'Biblische Archaologie,' 1. § 46) or of the people (see Kurtz's ' Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' p. 240, Eng. transl.). Under the Law these were appointed to be eaten in the holy place beside the altar (Leviticus 10:12, 13; Numbers 18:10); in Ezekiel's temple, a special quarter in the near vicinity of the house should be reserved for this purpose. There those portions of the sacrifices that could be eaten were to be consumed; as e.g., the flesh of the sin and trespass offerings, and the meal of the meat offering; but as these could not be at once used, they were to be deposited there until they were prepared for eating, the flesh by being boiled and the meal by being mixed with oil. The obvious intention of this was to convey an idea of the special sanctity of the worship in which the priests were engaged; and just for this reason also they were required to array themselves in other garments (Leviticus 16:23) when they entered on their priestly functions. The putting on and off of these holy clothes took place in the chambers now referred to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-20. - The temple precincts. The seer's guide, having completed his measurement of the house with its courts, proceeds to measure its encompassing wall, for this purpose conducting the prophet out by the east gate, and measuring, first the east, next the north, thirdly the south, and lastly the west wall, each five hundred reeds in length, or three thousand cubits, so that the entire area of the quadrangle amounted to 3000 × 3000 = 9,000,000 square cubits, equivalent to 2,250,000 square yards. Verse 15. - The inner house was not the temple as distinguished from its courts, but the temple with its courts, which lay within the wall about to be measured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Five hundred reeds. Ewald, Hitzig, and Smend, with others, following the LXX., regard this wall as that of the outer court, and change the \"reeds\" into \"cubits;\" but the majority of expositors adhere to the text, and understand the wall to be that of a great quadrangle which encompassed the whole structure, or the outer court and all within.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel42:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - To make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane. In these words the prophet indicates the purpose designed to be served by this particular wall; and although it may be said the outer court divided between the \"sanctuary,\" or that which was holy, and the \"profane,\" or that which was common, yet a more decided separation would assuredly be made by extending in the way described the precincts of the house. The objections usually offered to the view which regards the present measurements as those of a larger quadrangle encompassing the outer court, are not sufficient to make that view impossible.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE(1) It is said that the \"sanctuary\" always refers to the house as contrasted with its courts, especially with the outer court, and that in this sense it should here be taken; but the rendering, \"that which is holy,\" shows how the idea of special sanctity might easily be extended to the whole structure, including courts as well as house (see Psalm 114:2; Daniel 9:20).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) It is urged that there is no other instance in which the measurements are represented as having been taken by \"reeds\" in the plural; but a glance at Ezekiel 45:1, etc., and Ezekiel 48:16, will show that this is incorrect.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It is represented that in the center of such a huge quadrangle the house, with its courts and gates, would wear an insignificant appearance; but, while this might have been so had the area been crowded with other buildings, it is rather likely that in the midst of so large a vacant space the temple and its courts stand out with increased clearness, if not with augmented size.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) It is added that the summit of Mount Moriah could not admit of the construction of such a vast quadrangle; and it is answered that this shows the temple was an ideal house, never meant to be built upon the literal Moriah.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.43":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - The consecration of the temple by the entrance into it of the glory of the God of Israel. Verse 1. - Afterward, etc. Having completed the survey of the temple precincts (Ezekiel 42:15-20), the prophet's guide, \"the measuring man,\" conducted him back to the gate that looked towards the east, i.e. to the gate leading into the outer court from the east (see on Ezekiel 40:6), perhaps because this was the principal entrance to the sanctuary, but chiefly because through it the impending theophany was to pass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Scarcely had the prophet taken up his station at or near the gate when the glory of the God of Israel (see on Ezekiel 1:28; 3:23) came from the way of the east, as if intending to enter the temple by the very door through which it had previously departed from the temple (comp. Ezekiel 10:19; Ezekiel 11:22, 23). The voles which proceeded from the theophany and resembled the noise of many waters, is after the LXX. (καὶ φωνὴ τῆς παρεμβολῆς) by Keil and Smend understood to have been the sound produced by the motion of the wheels and the rustling of the wings of the cherubim (see on Ezekiel 1:2, 4; 10:5), but is better taken, with Kliefoth and Hengstenberg, to signify the voice of the Almighty himself, i.e. of the personal Jehovah (comp. Revelation 1:15). The statement that the earth shined with his glory (comp. Revelation 18:1) has by Havernick, Kliefoth, and others been supposed to indicate the absence of that \"cloud\" in which the glory of Jehovah appeared in both the Mosaic tabernacle (Exodus 40:34, 35) and the Solomonic temple (1 Kings 8:10, 11), and thereby to point to the clearer and more resplendent manifestations of the Godhead, which were to be given in connection with the new dispensation for which Ezekiel's \"house\" was being prepared. This, however, as Keil has shown, cannot be main-rained in face of the facts that in both Exodus and 1 Kings \"the glory of the Lord\" is used synonymously with \"the cloud,\" and that in Ezekiel's vision \"the glory\" and \"the cloud\" were alike present (see Ezekiel 10:3, 4). Kliefoth and Schroder hold \"the earth\" which was illumined to have been \"the whole globe,\" \"the entire region of humanity,\" as in Isaiah 6:3; Isaiah 60:1, etc.; but there does not appear ground for departing from the ordinary sense of the words, that \"the path\" of the advancing God was irradiated by the brilliance of his material glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The prophet identifies the vision on which he now looks as the same he had formerly beheld on the hanks of the Chebar, when he came to destroy the city, i.e. when, in obedience to Divine command, he stood forth to announce the destruction of Jerusalem. Ewald and Smend follow the Vulgate. quando venit ut disperderet, in substituting \"he,\" Jehovah, for \"I,\" Ezekiel; but the change is unnecessary, as the prophet's language is perfectly intelligible and quite correct, since \"the prophet destroyed the city ideally by his prophecy\" (Hitzig), and it is not unusual for Scripture to represent a prophet as himself doing what he is only sent to predict (comp. Ezekiel 4:2; Ezekiel 32:18; Jeremiah 1:10). The prophet's reason for introducing this clause was manifestly the same he had for identifying the visions - to show that, while it was the same Jehovah who had departed from the old temple that was now returning to the new, there was nothing incongruous in the idea that he who in the past had shown himself a God of justice and judgment by overturning and destroying the old, should in the future exhibit himself as a God of grace and mercy by condescending to establish his abode in the new. The impression produced upon the prophet's soul by his vision was the same that had been produced by the former - he fell upon his face in awe and wonder.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - The prophet next narrates that he saw the glory of the Lord entering into and taking possession of the \"house,\" as formerly it had entered into and taken possession of the tabernacle and the temple (Exodus 40:34, 35; 1 Kings 8:10, 11), and that of this he was further assured by experiencing immediately thereafter - not a push from the wind, as Luther and Kliefoth translate, but an impulse from the Spirit (not \"a spirit,\" Ewald, though the Hebrew word wants the article), which raised him from the ground upon which he had fallen (ver. 3), took him up (see on Ezekiel 2:2; 3:12), and brought him into the inner court, exactly in front of the \"house,\" where, having looked into the interior, he saw that the glory of the Lord filled the house, the language being that used in connection with the tabernacle and the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And I heard him (better, one) speaking unto me out of the house; and the (literally, a) man stood by me. Two questions arise - Who was the speaker? and, Who the man? As to the speaker, the natural reply is that the One who addressed Ezekiel from the interior of the \"house\" was Jehovah himself, whose \"glory\" had just entered in to take possession of the house, and this view is adopted by most interpreters, though Hengstenberg and Schroder regard the man who stood beside the prophet as the one who addressed him. As to the man, it cannot, as Kliefoth maintains, be decided solely by the absence of the article before \"man\" that this was a different person from the guide who had hitherto conducted the prophet and measured the Building. The article may have Been emitted because the important point to be recorded was not the circumstance that the \"one\" who stood beside him was his quondam guide, but the fact that this \"one\" was a man. That he was also Ezekiel's old conductor is at least a natural suggestion when one finds him afterwards appearing as a measurer with a line in his hand (Ezekiel 47:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-12. - Debate exists as to who the speaker in the seventh verse was, whether Jehovah or the man - some holding with Kliefoth, Ewald, Smend, and Currey, that he was Jehovah; others, with Havernick, Keil, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, that he was \"the man;\" and still others, with Plumptre, that it cannot be decided which he was. One thing is clear, that if \"the man\" was the speaker, his words and message were not his own, but Jehovah's. Yet unless the man had been the angel of the Lord - the view of Hengstenberg and Schroder - it will always seem incongruous that he should have addressed Ezekiel without a \"Thus saith the Lord.\" Hence the notion that the speaker was Jehovah is, perhaps, the one freest from difficulty. The message announced or communication made to the prophet related first to Jehovah's purpose in entering the temple (vers. 7-9), and secondly to his object in showing the house to the prophet, viz. that he might show it to the house of Israel (vers. 10-12). Verse 7. - The LXX. and the Vulgate divide the present verse into two parts, and take the first as equivalent to a solemn word of consecration, the former supplying ἑώρακας the latter vidisti, \"thou hast seen.\" The Chaldee Targum inserts, hic est locus, \"this is the place,\" and in so doing is followed by Luther and the Revised Version. Some word, it is obvious, either a \"see!\" or a \"behold!\" must be interpolated, in thought at least, unless one adopts the construction of the Authorized Version, with which Smend agrees, and makes \"the place of my throne,\" etc., to be governed By the verb \"defile,\" or, with Ewald, places it under the regimen of \"show\" in ver. 10, throwing the whole intervening clause into a long parenthesis - a device which does not contribute to lucidity. Of the two expressions here employed to designate the sanctuary - not the temple proper, but the whole house with its surroundings - the former, the place of my throne, though peculiar to Ezekiel, receives explanation from the conception, familiar to earlier writers, of Jehovah as dwelling between the cherubim (Exodus 25:22; 1 Samuel 4:4; 2 Kings 19:15; Psalm 80:1; Isaiah 37:16); the latter, the place of the soles of my feet, was of frequent occurrence to denote the ark of the covenant (1 Chronicles 28:2; Psalm 99:5; Psalm 132:7) and the temple (Isaiah 60:13; Lamentations 2:1). The word of consecration was expressed in the promise, I will dwell (in the temple) in the midst of the children of Israel forever, etc., which went beyond anything that had been spoken concerning either the tabernacle of Moses or the temple of Solomon (comp. Exodus 25:8; Exodus 29:45; 1 Kings 6:13). The second part of the verse announces what would be the result of Jehovah's perpetual inhabitation of the temple - the house of Israel would no more defile his holy Name either by their whoredom or by the carcasses of their kings in their high places, or, according to another reading, in their death. That the whoredom signified idolatry (comp. Ezekiel 16.) commentators are agreed. What divides them is whether this also is alluded to in the alternative clause. Rosenmüller, Havernick, Keil, Fairbairn, and Plumptre believe it is, contending that the \"carcasses of their kings\" (comp. Leviticus 26:30; and Jeremiah 16:18) was a contemptuous and satirical designation of the idols they had formerly served, that the word \"kings ' is frequently employed in this sense in Scripture (see Isaiah 8:21; Amos 5:26; Zephaniah 1:5), and that the special sin complained of, that of building altars for dead idols in the very temple court, had been practiced by more kings than one in Judah (comp. 2 Kings 16:11; 2 Kings 21:4, 5-7); and in support of this view may be urged first that it is favored by the use of the term bamotk, or \"high places,\" in ver. 7, and secondly by the exposition offered in ver. 8 of the nature of the sin. Ewald, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Smend, on the other hand, regard the sin spoken of in the second clause as different from that indicated in the first, maintaining that while this was the practice of defiling Jehovah's sanctuary by idolatry that was the desecration of the same by the interment in its courts of their dead kings. Against this, however, stands the fact that no authentic instance can be produced of a Judaean sovereign's corpse having been interred in the temple area. David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, and others were buried in the city of David (1 Kings 2:10; 1 Kings 11:43; 1 Kings 22:50), and a place of sepulchers existed on the south-west comer of Zion in the days of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 3:16); but these prove nothing unless the temple hill be taken, as no doubt it sometimes was, in an extended sense as inclusive of Mount Zion. Similarly, the statement that Manasseh had a burial-place in the garden of Uzzah (2 Kings 21:18, 26) cannot be adduced in support of this view, unless it can be shown that the garden of Uzzah was situated on the temple hill. On the whole, therefore, the balance of argument inclines in favor of the first view, though it does involve the introduction of a figurative sense into the words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds etc. The first \"their\" can only refer to \"the house of Israel and their kings;\" the second \"their\" may also allude to these, but is best taken as pointing to the \"idols,\" whose thresholds or temples, according to the view adopted of the preceding verse, were set up in the court of Jehovah's temple, and so close to the latter that nothing stood between them except the temple wall Smend, who favors the second view of the preceding verse, considers this verse as a complaint against the kings for having erected their royal residence on Mount Zion, in the immediate vicinity of the temple; but as David's palace was older than the temple, it is not likely Ezekiel was guilty of perverting history in the manner this hypothesis would imply.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now let them put away their whoredom, etc. What has just been declared to be the necessary consequence of Jehovah's abiding in the midst of Israel is now enjoined upon Israel as an indispensable prerequisite of Jehovah's taking up his residence amongst them. Ezekiel's theology in this respect harmonizes with that of Old and New Testament writers generally, who invariably postulate purity of heart and life as a necessary condition of God's abiding in the heart, while asserting that such Divine indwelling in the heart is the only certain creator of such purity (comp. Ezekiel 18:31; Ezekiel 36:26; Isaiah 1:16, 25; Isaiah 26:12; John 14:23; 2 Corinthians 6:17; James 4:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Show (or, make known, i.e. publish the revelation concerning) the house to the house of Israel For this purpose the vision had been imparted to the prophet. That they may be ashamed of their iniquities. This told the reason why the vision of the house should be made known to Israel. And let them measure the pattern; sum, number, or well-proportioned building. This explained how, by beholding the house, Israel would be led to repent, and be ashamed of her iniquities. There is no ground for thinking the ultimate object Jehovah had in view, in recommending the house of Israel to note the proportions of the visionary edifice, was, as Wellhausen, Smend, and others allege, that they might reproduce these in the post-exilic building; if they were to measure, i.e. scan and meditate upon the fair dimensions of the \"house,\" it was that they might understand its religious or moral and spiritual significance, both as a whole and in detail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And if they be ashamed of all that they have done. This cannot signify that Ezekiel was not to show the house until they had evinced a sincere penitence for past wickedness, since the converse has just been stated, that their repentance should flow from a disclosure to them of the house: but that in the event of the presentation to them of the \"well-measured\" building awaking in them any disposition of regret and sorrow, then the prophet should proceed to unfold to them its details. He should show them first the form of the house, i.e. the external shape of the building, and the fashion thereof, or its well-proportioned and harmonious arrangements; the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, i.e. its exits and entrances (Ezekiel 44:5), and all the forms thereof; which can only mean the shapes of its several parts; and all the ordinances thereof, or regulations concerning its use in worship, and all the forms thereof - the same words as above, and therefore omitted by the LXX. as well as some Hebrew manuscripts, and, after their example, by Dathe, Hitzig, Ewald, Smend, and others, though Keil, Kliefoth, Schroder, and others retain the clause as genuine, and regard it as an illustration of Ezekiel's habit of crowding words together for the sake of emphasis - and all the laws thereof, by which were probably signified \"the instructions contained in these statutes for sanctification of life\" (Keil). In addition to rehearsing the above in the hearing of the people, the prophet was directed to write them in their sight, if it be not open to understand the \"writing\" as explanatory of the way in which the\" showing\" was to be made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This is the law of the house. In this instance \"the house\" must not be restricted to the temple proper, consisting of the holy place and the holy of holies, but extended to the whole free space encompassing the outer court, the quadrangular area of three thousand cubits square (Ezekiel 42:16-20); and concerning this house as so defined, the fundamental torah, law, or regulation, is declared to be that of its complete sanctity. Ewald and Smend, as usual, unite with the LXX. in connecting \"upon the top of the mountain\" with \"house;\" but expositors generally agree that the clause belong to the words that follow, Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about; and that the prophet's thought is that the entire territory upon the mountain summit included within the above specified border, and not merely the inner sanctuary, or even that with its chambers and courts, was to be regarded as most holy, or as a holy of holies, i.e. was to be consecrated as the innermost adytum of the tabernacle and temple had been. by the indwelling of Jehovah. Smend notes that \"This is the law\" is the customary underwriting and superscription of the laws of the priest-code (see Leviticus 6:9, 14; Leviticus 7:1, 37; Leviticus 11:46; Leviticus 12:7; Leviticus 13:59; Leviticus 14:54; Leviticus 15:32); but it need not result from this that the priest. code borrowed this expression from Ezekiel, who employs it only in this verse. The more rational hypothesis is that Ezekiel, himself a priest, made use of this formula, because acquainted with it as already existing in the so-called priest-code.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-27. - The temple-altar described (vers. 13-17), and the ritual for its consecration explained (vers. 18-27).

Its dimensions, then omitted, are now reported in connection with its consecration, which also is narrated as a pendant to that of the \"house,\" because of the intimate connection between the two - the consecration of the altar being practically equivalent to the consecration of the house, and the consecration of the house finding approximate expression in the consecration of the altar. As in the other portions of the temple, so in this, the measurements are given after the cubits, i.e. by or in cubits, the length of each cubit being noted at \"a cubit and an hand-breadth,\" as in Ezekiel 40:5. They are likewise taken first from the foundation upwards (vers. 13-15), and then from the top downwards (vers. 16, 17). The first portion measured is the bottom; literally, the bosom (Hebrew, חֵיק, \"that which embraces,\" from הוּק \"to embrace;\" LXX., κόλπωμα: Vulgate, sinus); but what exactly that signified is debated among interpreters. Gesenius thinks of \"the hollowed part for the fire;\" Hitzig, of \"a frame running round, a stand in which the altar stood;\" Kliefoth, of \"a deepening on the wooden ring in which the whole altar stands;\" Keil, of\" a lower hollow or base of the altar, formed by a border of a definite height;\" Smend, of \"the channel or gutter of the altar base, which should receive the sacrificial blood;\" Havernick, Currey, and Plumptre, of \"a base upon which the altar stood.\" If Smend's feasible notion be not adopted, then probably that of Hitzig, Kliefoth, or Keil most nearly expresses the conception of the Hebrew term. The altar was surrounded by an enclosure in which it seemed to be set, or out of which to rise; the dimensions of this \"stand\" or \"enclosure\" being a cubit in height, and a cubit in breadth, with a border on its edge round about a span or half a cubit high. This, the stand just described, should be the higher place; literally, the back; hence the support, base (Revised Version), or elevation, ὕψος (LXX.) of the altar.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The next measurements which are taken from the bottom upon the ground, i.e. from the הֵיק, \"base,\" or ground framework above described, to the lower settle, i.e. to the top of the undermost of the two \"terraces,\" or enclosures,\" or \"platforms,\" of which the altar consisted, are two cubits of height with one cubit of breadth; the measurements which follow, from the lesser settle, i.e. the undermost, to the greater settle, i.e. the uppermost, are four cubits of height with one cubit of breadth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Noteworthy is the word altar, which in this verse renders two distinct Hebrew terms, הַרְאֵל and אֲרִיאֵל, which Gesenius, Hitzig, Ewald, Smend, and others, after the LXX. (τὸ ἀριὴλ), identify as synonymous, and translate by \"hearth.\" But the first can only signify \"the mount of God,\" while the latter may mean either \"lion of God\" or \"hearth of God.\" Kliefoth, deriving the latter from אָרָה, \"to consume,\" and אַיִכ, \"a ram,\" prefers as its import \"ram-devourer;\" Hengstenberg, resolving into אַיִל \"a ram,\" and אְרַיִ, \"a lion,\" proposes as its equivalent \"ram-lion.\" i.e. \"the lion that consumes the rams for God\" - a ten-doting closely allied to that of Kliefoth. In any case, the terms allude to parts of the altar: the second, Ariel (equivalent to the hearth on which God's fire burns), according to Keil, Kliefoth, and the best expositors, meaning the flat surface of the altar; and the first, Harel (conveying the ideas of elevation and sanctity), the base on which it rested. The height of this base was four cubits, while from the hearth projected four horns, as in the altars of the Mosaic tabernacle (Exodus 27:2; Exodus 38:2; Leviticus 4:7, 18; Leviticus 8:15) and Solomonic temple (Psalm 118:27). If the length of these be set down, as Kliefoth suggests, at three cubits, then the whole height of the altar will be in cubits - one for the ground bottom, two for the lower settle, four for the upper, four for the bases of the hearth, with three for the horns, equal to fourteen in all; or, omitting the horns, of which the length is not given, and the altar base, which is distinguished from the altar, ten cubits in all for the altar proper. As to the symbolic import of the \"horns,\" Kurtz, after Hofmaun and Kliefoth, finds this in the idea of elevation, the \"horns,\" as the highest point in the altar, bringing the blood put upon them nearer to God than the sides did the blood sprinkled on them (see 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' § 13); Keil, after Bahr, in the notions of strength, beauty, and blessing, the horns of an animal being the points in which its power, grace, and fullness of life are concentrated, and therefore fitting emblems of those points in the altar in which appears \"its significance as a place of the revelation of Divine might and strength, of Divine salvation and blessing\" ('Biblische Archaologie,' § 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - The measurements that now begin concern the breadth of the altar, and proceed from above downwards. First the altar, or, hearth of God (Hebrew, ariel) was twelve cubits long and twelve broad, i.e. was square in the four squares (or, sides) thereof, or a perfect square (comp. Exodus 27:1; Revelation 21:16). Next the settle, or, enclosure (Hebrew, הָעֲזָרָה) of ver. 14, was fourteen cubits long, and fourteen broad in the four squares (or, sides) thereof; the fourteen being made up of the twelve cubits of the altar-hearth's side with one cubit of ledge from the settle all round. The only question is to which \"settle,\" the upper or the under, reference is made. Some expositors, identifying the greater Azarah with the Harel, i.e. the \"upper settle,\" with \"the mount of God\" or the base of the hearth, make the altar height only seven cubits from the ground to the hearth. The general belief, however, is that they cannot be so identified. Among interpreters who distinguish them, Kliefoth, with whom Smend agrees, holds the \"settle\" in this verse to be the harel, or \"mount of God,\" which extended (Smend says with a hek. or \"gutter\") one cubit on each side beyond the ariel, or \"hearth of God,\" so that the \"mount of God,\" on which the\" hearth of God\" rested, was fourteen cubits square. Then, assuming a similar extension of one cubit at each stage - in the greater azarah, the lesser azarah, and the hek, or ground bottom - he finds the surface of the greater azarah to be sixteen, of the lesser azarah eighteen, and of the ground bottom twenty cubits square. Keil, with whom Schroder and Currey agree, objects to this as involving too much of arbitrary assumption, and takes the\" settle\" of this verse to mean the lower azarah; so that no additional measurements are required beyond those given in the text. If the square surface of the greater azarah be considered as having been the same as that of the harel, so that their sides were continuous, then, as the \"ground bottom\" extended one cubit on each side beyond the lower azarsh, the altar at its base was a square of sixteen cubits. Comparing now these measurements with those of the altar of burnt offering in the tabernacle and the temple, one finds that the former was only five cubits square and three cubits high (Exodus 27:1), while the latter was twenty cubits broad, but only ten cubits high (2 Chronicles 4:1), which awakes the suspicion that the different views above noted have been insensibly influenced by a desire on the part of their authors to make them harmonize with the measurements of the temple. But there does not appear sufficient reason why the measurements of Ezekiel's altar should have agreed with those of Solomon's rather than with those of Moses', The border (or, parapet) of half a cubit which ran round the ledge, or bottom, of a cubit, at the foot of the lower azarah was clearly designed, not for the protection of the priest officiating, but for ornament. The stairs (or, steps), mention of which closes the description, mark a departure, not from the pattern of the Solomonic temple, in which the altar must have had steps (see Keil's 'Biblische Archaologie,' p. 141), but from the pattern of the tabernacle, in which altar-steps were disallowed (Exodus 20:26) and did not exist (Exodus 38:1-7). But if, as Jewish tradition asserts, the pest-exilic altar had no steps as Ezekiel's had, having been reached by an inclined plane, because in the so-called book of the covenant steps were forbidden, how does this harmonize with the theory that Ezekiel's vision temple was designed as a model for the post-exilic temple? And why, if the priest-code was the composition of a writer who worked in the spirit and on the lines of Ezekiel, should it have omitted to assign steps to the tabernacle altar?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The ordinances of the altar. These were not the regulations for the sacrificial worship to be afterwards performed upon this altar, but the rites to be observed at its consecration when the day should arrive for its construction. As the altar in the tabernacle (Exodus 29:1-46; Leviticus 8:11-33), and that in Solomon's temple (1 Kings 8:63-66; 2 Chronicles 7:4-10), so was this in Ezekiel's \"house\" dedicated by a special ceremonial before being brought into ordinary use. The particular ritual observed by Solomon is not described in detail; but a comparison between that enjoined upon and practiced by Moses with that revealed to and published by Ezekiel shows that while in some respects they agreed, in other important particulars they differed. In both the ceremony largely consisted in offering sacrifice and smearing blood, and lasted seven days; but in the former the ceremony was performed exclusively by Moses, consisted, in addition to the above, of an anointing of the altar, the holy utensils, and the tabernacle itself with oil, and was associated with the consecration of the priests; whereas in the latter, in addition to some variations in the sacrificial victims, which will be noted in the course of exposition, the priests should bear an active part - there should be no anointing with oil, and no consecration of the priests, the priesthood being assumed as already existing. If in Ezekiel's ritual there was no mention of a cleansing of the sanctuary (that of Ezekiel 45:18 referring to a special ease), but only of the altar, that was sufficiently explained by the circumstance that Jehovah was already in the \"house.\" The final clause, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon, indicates the purpose for which the altar was to be used.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thou shalt give to the priests. This injunction, which was addressed to Ezekiel, not as the representative of the people or of the priests (Smend), but as the prophet of Jehovah, made it clear that Ezekiel was not to act in the future consecration of the altar alone as Moses did in the dedication of the tabernacle altar, but that the priests were to bear their part in the ceremonial. If some expressions, as the use of \"thou\" in this and the following verses, appear to suggest that Ezekiel alone should officiate, the employment of \"they\" in vers. 22, 24, 25, 26 as plainly indicates that Ezekiel's share in the ceremonial was to be performed through the medium of the priests. And, indeed, if the temple was a pattern designed to be converted into an actual building after the return from captivity, as the newer criticism contends, it is apparent that Ezekiel could not have been expected to have any hand in its erection. The Levites that be of the seed of Zadok. The assistants of Ezekiel and the officiating priests at the new altar were not to be the whole body of the Levitical priesthood, but those only who derived their descent from Zadok (see on Ezekiel 44:15). A young bullock for a sin offering. With the offering of this the ritual commenced, as in Exodus 29:1, 10 and Leviticus 8:14 (comp. Ezekiel 45:18). It is observable that in the Levitical code a young bullock, i.e. of a bullock in the full vigor of youth, is appointed as the requisite sin offering for the priest, i.e. the high priest, who was the head and representative of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it. The application of the victim's blood to and upon the altar formed an integral part of every expiatory offering; but \"whereas in all the other kinds of sacrifice the blood was poured indifferently round about the altar of the fore court, in the sin offering it was not to be sprinkled, lest the intention should be overlooked, but smeared with the finger upon the horns of the altar ('And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns,' Leviticus 4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34) (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' § 107). In the present instance the blood was to be carefully put upon the four horns of the altar - the only part to be smeared with blood in the Mosaic consecration (Exodus 29:12) - the four corners of the settle, or azarah, but whether the greater or lesser is left undecided, though in all probability it was the under, if not both, and the border round about, that mentioned in ver. 17; and the effect of this smearing with blood should be to cleanse and purge, or, make atonement for, the altar; not for the people, as Havernick interprets, saying, \"without an atoned-for altar, no atoned-for people (ohne entsuhnten Altar, kein entsuhntes Volk),\" but for the altar, either, as Kliefoth suggests, because, being made out of a part of the sinful earth and world, it required to be sanctified, or because, as Plumptre prefers, the sins of the people having been, as it were, transferred to it, it stood in need of cleansing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - As a further stage in the ceremony, the Bullock of the sin offering, i.e. the carcass of the victim, was to be burned by Ezekiel or the priest acting for him in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary, as in the Mosaic code it was prescribed that the flesh of the bullock, with his skin and dung, should be burned without the camp (Exodus 29:14; Leviticus 4:12, 21; Leviticus 9:11, 15; comp. Hebrews 13:13). Ewald at first sought the place here referred to in the sacrificial kitchens (Ezekiel 46:19), which it could not be, as these belonged to the \"sanctuary\" in the strictest sense; he has, however, since adopted the view of Kliefoth, which is doubtless correct, that the \"place of the house, without the sanctuary\" meant the gizrah, or separate place (Ezekiel 41:12), which was a part of the \"house\" in the widest sense, and yet belonged not to the \"sanctuary\" in the strictest sense. Smend thinks of the migrash, \"suburbs\" or \"open spaces,\" which surrounded the temple precincts (Ezekiel 45:2); and these were certainly without the sanctuary, while they were also appointed for the holy place, and might have been designated, as here, miphkadh, as being always under the inspection of the temple watchmen. The fact that in post-exilic times one of the city gates was called Hammiphkadh (Nehemiah 3:31) lends countenance to this view. That in this \"appointed place\" the carcass of the bullock should be consumed was a deviation from the Mosaic ritual, which prescribed that the fat portions should be burned upon the altar, and the rest eaten as a sacrificial meal (Leviticus 4:10, 26, 35; Leviticus 7:15, 81; Deuteronomy 12:7, 17, 18). Keil appears to think that the fat portions may have been burned upon the altar, although it is not so mentioned, and that only \"those points\" were mentioned \"in which deviations from the ordinary ritual took place.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The second day's ceremonial should begin with the offering of a kid of the goats (rather, a he-goat) without blemish for a sin offering, the ritual observed being probably the same as that of the preceding day. The substitution of a \"he-goat,\" the offering for a ruler who sins (Leviticus 4:23, 24), instead of a \"young bullock,\" which formed the first day's offering, was a deviation from the ritual prescribed for the consecration of the Mosaic altar and priesthood (Exodus 29:36). The object of the offering of the \"he-goat\" was the same as that of the offering of the \"bullock,\" viz. to cleanse the altar; not, however, as if the previous day's cleansing had been insufficient and required to be supplemented, or had already become inefficient so as to call for renewal, but in the sense of recalling the meaning and impression of the previous day's ceremonial, and so in a manner linking it on with the several rites of the succeeding days.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - The presentation of a burnt offering unto the Lord was the next item in the ritual that should be observed. The material composing it should consist of a young bullock without blemish, as in the ordinary sacrificial cede (Leviticus 1:3, 4, 5), and a ram out of the flock without blemish, as in the consecration of the priests (Exodus 29:18) and of the altar (Leviticus 8:18). The persons presenting it should be the prophet, thou, and the priests, they, as his representatives. The mode of offering should be by burning, the distinctive act in a burnt offering, as that of a sin offering was sprinkling, and that of a peace offering the sacrificial meal, and by casting salt upon the carcass, a feature in every meat offering (Leviticus 2:13), and here added probably to intensify the idea of purification. \"In the corrosive and antiseptic property of salt there is hidden something of the purifying and consuming nature of fire; hence the Redeemer, in Mark 9:49, combines the salting of the sacrifice with the purifying fire of self- denial\" (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' § 145). The significance of it should be an expression of complete self-surrender unto Jehovah, as the necessary outcome of the antecedent act of expiation. The time of its presentation should be immediately after the cleansing of the altar on the second day, and presumably also on the succeeding days. Whether the burnt offering was, as Keil maintains, or was not, as Kliefoth contends, offered also on the first day is difficult to decide, though the former opinion has, perhaps, most in its favor. The Mosaic ritual always enjoined a burnt offering to be offered as a sequel to the sin offering (comp. Exodus 29:14, 18, with Leviticus 8:14, 18; and see Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' § 86); and, in accordance with this, vers. 23 and 24 naturally follow on vers. 19-21, ver. 22 being interposed because of the variation in the sin offering for the second day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Seven days. Hitzig reckons these as additional to the first (ver. 19) and second (ver. 22) days; Kliefoth begins them with the second; Keil, Schroder, Currey, and the majority of expositors take them as inclusive of the first and second. Hitzig's proposal may be set aside, since it cannot be maintained without erasing \"thou shalt make atonement for it\" in ver. 20, and the first half of the present verse. In favor of Kliefoth's view may be urged that the first day appears to stand out from the others, 'and to be distinguished by the peculiar character of its offering - a young bullock for a sin offering, without any accompanying burnt offering; that the offerings on the second and subsequent days are alike, a he-goat and a ram; that on each of the seven days a goat is mentioned for a sin offering, whereas on the first day it was a young bullock that was slain; and that in Zechariah 3:9 occurs an allusion to what seems a special day such as this first day of Ezekiel. In support of Keil's interpretation it is contended that the seven days were to be employed in purging or making atonement for, and purifying the altar, which was in part at least (even admitting a distinction in meaning between חָטָּא and טָהַר) the business of the first day; that the general statement in ver. 20 as to a goat for a sin offering on the seven days admits of easy qualification by the previous statement in ver. 19; and that seven days was the normal duration of religious solemnities under the Law (see Leviticus 8:33; 1 Kings 8:65; 2 Chronicles 7:8, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They shall purge the altar. Smend thinks it strange that only the purification of the altar should be mentioned here, while that of the sanctuary is referred to later (Ezekiel 45:18), and finds in this an explanation (at least, perhaps) of the fact that in Exodus 29:36 only the consecration of the Mosaic altar - not of the Mosaic tabernacle - is reported. He conceives it likely that the author of Exodus 29:36 copied Ezekiel, but does not explain why Ezekiel may not have copied the author of Exodus 29:36. And they shall consecrate themselves; more correctly, they - i.e. the priests - shall consecrate it; literally, fill its hand. The phrase, מִלֵּאיָד, \"to fill one's hand,\" sc. with gifts, occurs with reference to Jehovah (Exodus 32:29; 1 Chronicles 29:5; 2 Chronicles 29:31). It is also employed in the sense of filling the hand of another, as e.g. of a priest, with sacrificial gifts, when he is instituted into his sacred office (Exodus 28:41; Exodus 29:9; Leviticus 21:10; comp, Leviticus 8:27). Here the hand to be filled is that of the altar, which is personified for the purpose (compare the use of the terms \"bosom\" and \"lip\" in connection with the altar). The meaning is that the altar, at its consecration, should have a plentiful supply of gifts, to symbolize that the offering of such gifts was the work for which it was set apart, and that it should never be without them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel43:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The eighth day, and so forward. Omit \"so.\" With this day the regular sacrificial service should commence. Thenceforward the priests should offer upon the altar the burnt offerings and peace offerings of the people. The omission of sin offerings is explained by Keil, on the principle that \"burnt offerings\" and \"peace offerings\" were \"the principal and most frequent sacrifices, whilst sin offerings and meat offerings were implied therein;\" Kliefoth adding that Ezekiel 44:27, 29; Ezekiel 45:17, 19, 22, 23, 25; and Ezekiel 46:20 show it cannot be inferred that sin offerings were no more to be offered on this altar. At the same time, the prominence given to \"burnt\" and \"peace\" as distinguished from \"sin offerings\" may, as Schroder suggests, have pointed to the fact that the sacrificers who should use this altar would be \"a people in a state of grace,\" to whom Jehovah was prepared to say, I will accept you, not your offerings alone, but your persons as well; and not these because of those, but contrariwise, these on account of these. Kliefoth's idea, that the first day symbolized the future day of Christ's sacrifice, that the seven intermediate days (on his hypothesis) pointed to the period of the Christian Church, and that the eighth day looked forward to the time of the end, while not without elements of truth, is open to this objection, that in the period of the Christian Church there should have been \"no more sacrifice for sin;\" and yet, as Kliefoth admits, \"sin offerings\" were afterwards to be made upon this altar.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.44":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - The relation of the prince to the sanctuary. Verse 1. - The gate of the outward sanctuary, the outer gate of the sanctuary (Revised Version) - which looketh toward the east. To this door the prophet was conducted back, by way of the inner north or south gate, from the inner court, in which he had received the measurements of the altar and the instructions for its consecration (Ezekiel 43:5). Whether Ezekiel stood upon the outside of this door as in Ezekiel 43:1, or upon its inside, cannot as yet be determined; but in either ease he observed that it was shut - again, whether on the east side towards the temple precincts, or on the west towards the outer court, is not mentioned, and cannot at this stage be decided. What led the seer to notice that the gate was closed was probably the circumstance that the last time he stood beside it it was open (Ezekiel 43:1), though proof cannot be given that he passed through it (Ezekiel 43:5), conjoined with the fact that it formed the principal entrance to the temple, and as such had been described to him and measured (Ezekiel 40:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This gate shall be shut, The prophet must have noted this as an important difference between the new sanctuary and the old (whether temple or tabernacle), in which the east gate stood always open. That the gate of the new temple was to be closed only on the six working days Ewald mistakenly infers from Ezekiel 46:1, where he reads, after the LXX., the outer instead of the inner court. But Ezekiel 46:1 refers to the east gate of the inner court. Of the east gate of the outer court it is declared emphatically that it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it, meaning that it should be closed in perpetuity; and that not, as Abar-banel and Lightfoot have supposed, to express the idea that the glory of Jehovah should no more depart from the temple, but abide in it forever, but to inspire an exalted conception of the sanctity of the \"house\" and all its belongings, as Jehovah explained, Because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It is for the prince conveys an erroneous impression, as if the edict, excluding all from passing through the east outer gate, did not apply to the prince; but even for him the gate was not to serve as a mode of entrance into the temple, or, if so, only on exceptional occasions (see on Ezekiel 46:2), but merely as a place to sit in. The Revised Version accurately renders the words, As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince, etc. That the \"prince\" here alluded to (הַגָּשִׂיא) could not have been the Prince David, i.e. the Messiah already spoken of (Ezekiel 34:23, 24; Ezekiel 37:24), but must have denoted the civic authorities of the new community of Israel, \"the civil head of the theocracy,\" Havernick infers from Ezekiel 45:8, 9, where the coming \"prince\" is contrasted with Israel's previous rulers who oppressed their subjects, from the absence of some such characteristic predicate as \"shepherd\" or \"king,\" which would, he thinks, have been attached to the word \"prince\" had it been intended to designate Messiah, from the prince's offering for himself a sin offering (Ezekiel 45:22), from the allusion to his sons (Ezekiel 46:16), and from what is recorded about his behavior in worship (Ezekiel 46:2); but none of these statements concerning the \"prince' forbids his identification with Messiah, unless on the supposition that it was already understood Messiah should be a Divine-human Personage. This, however, had not then been so distinctly revealed as to be widely and accurately known. Hence it seems enough to say that while the \"prince\" would have his highest antitype in the Messiah, he would also have, though in a lower and lesser degree, an antitype in every righteous ruler (if ever there should be such) who might subsequently preside over Israel (see on Ezekiel 37:25). The phrase, to eat bread before the Lord, while referring in the first instance to those sacrificial meals which, under the Law, commonly accompanied unbloody offerings, as the meat offerings (Leviticus 2:3), the showbread (Leviticus 24:9), and the unleavened leaves of the Passover (Exodus 12:18; Leviticus 23:6; Numbers 28:17; Deuteronomy 16:3), and could only be partaken of by the priests, in the second instance signified to partake of sacrificial meals in general, even of such as consisted of the portions of flesh which were eaten in connection with ordinary bloody offerings (Genesis 31:54; Exodus 18:12). If, after Kliefoth, the former be adopted as the import of the phrase here, then the thought will be that in the new cultus the prince should enjoy a privilege which under the old was not possessed even by the king; if, after Keil, the second view be preferred, the sense will amount to this, that under the regulations of the future the prince should have the favor accorded him \"of holding his sacrificial meals in the gate,\" whereas the people should only be permitted to hold theirs \"in the court,\" or \"in the vicinity of the sacrificial kitchens.\" The way of the porch is mentioned as the ingress and egress for the prince; which implies that he should obtain access to the outer court by either the north or the south gate, since the outer door of the east gate was shut. This renders it probable that Ezekiel was himself standing on the outside of the east gate (see on ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-16. - The relations of the people, Levites, and priests to the sanctuary. Verse 4. - From the outside of the east gate of the outer court the prophet was brought the way of the north gate, but whether of the outer or of the inner is uncertain, and set down before the house. On the ground that the prophet at his new station was in front of the temple, Hitzig, Keil, and others decide for the north gate of the inner court; whereas Kliefoth, looking to the circumstance that the first communications made to the prophet at his new post concerned \"the entering in of the house,\" and \"the going forth of the sanctuary,\" prefers the north gate of the outer court. But at whichever of the gates the prophet was set down he perceived a second time (comp. Ezekiel 43:5) that the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord, and this, perhaps, should cast the balance in favor of the inner court entrance, from which the interior of the \"house\" could be more easilyNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Having fallen on his face before the renewed theophany, the prophet was summoned as once before (Ezekiel 40:4), but with greater emphasis than before, to mark well, or set his heart to observe, the communications about to be made to him concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and. all the laws thereof (see on Ezekiel 43:11), more especially with regard to the persons who should have a right to participate in its services.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let it suffice you of all your abominations. It was not without sights canoe that at the north gate, which had formerly been represented as the scene of Israel's idolatries (Ezekiel 8:5), the prophet should be reminded of those past iniquities of his nation, and receive instructions as to how the new community should be preserved from lapsing into similar transgressions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The special sin chargeable against Israel in the past had been the introduction into the sanctuary, while the priests were engaged in sacrifice, of strangers - aliens (Revised Version); literally, sons of a stranger - uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, in express contravention of Jehovah's covenant. Ewald, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Currey restrict the designation \"strangers\" to unfaithful and unauthorized priests, who, as in the days of Israel's apostasy, notoriously under Jeroboam (1 Kings 12:31; 2 Chronicles 11:15), may, in the confluence of idolatries that took place in Jerusalem during the reigns of Ahaz (2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-15; 2 Chronicles 28:2-4, 23-25) and Manasseh (2 Kings 21:2-7, 11, 15; 2 Chronicles 33:2-7), have been admitted to participate in the temple services; but Kliefoth, Delitzsch, Keil, Smend, and Plumptre, with better judgment, recognize in the \"strangers\" foreigners who had not incorporated themselves with Israel by submitting to circumcision, but, though dwelling in the midst of Israel, were still uncircumcised heathen in both heart and flesh. With regard to these foreigners, the Law of Moses (Leviticus 17:8, 10) enacted that, by accepting circumcision, they might become members of the Israelitish commonwealth, but that without this they could not be permitted to partake of the Passover, the highest symbol of national and religious unity (Exodus 12:48, 49). Nevertheless, it was open to them, on giving a certain measure of obedience to the Law (Exodus 12:19; Exodus 20:10; Leviticus 17:10, 12; Leviticus 18:26; Leviticus 20:2; Leviticus 24:16, 22), to enter the sanctuary and present all sorts of offerings to Jehovah (Leviticus 17:8; Numbers 15:14, 29) Hence Israel's offence had not been the admission of such \"sons of the stranger\" into the sanctuary, but the admission of them without insisting on the above specified conditions, in other words, the admission of such as not only lacked the bodily mark of circumcision - which would not have excluded them - but were destitute as well of the first elements of Hebrew piety, i.e. were as uncircumcised in heart as they were in the flesh. The sanctioning of such within the temple courts, while Jehovah's bread, the fat and the blood, was being offered, i.e. while sacrificial worship was being performed, was not simply a desecration of the \"house,\" but was an express violation of the covenant Jehovah had made with Israel with reference to these very \"sons of the stranger.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Instead of having exercised a holy solicitude for the purity of the temple and the regularity of its rites, by keeping strict watch over the holy things of Jehovah, the house of Israel had set keepers; literally, had set them, i.e. the uncircumcised \"strangers\" above referred to, as keepers of Jehovah's charge in his sanctuary for themselves, i.e. to please themselves, irrespective altogether of Jehovah's enactments. From this it has been argued, by Wellhausen, Smend, Driver, and others, that the \"strangers\" above mentioned had been not only allowed access to the outer court as spectators or as worshippers while the priests were offering sacrifice, but admitted to the inner court as assistants to the priests in their altar duties, that this, the employment of these heathen hierodules, had been the special wickedness of which Israel had been guilty, and that henceforward these \"foreign ministers\" were to be thrust out from their offices, and their places supplied by the about-to-be-degraded Levites. It is, however, doubtful if the phrase, keepers of my charge in the sanctuary, can be made to signify more than has already been expressed by the clause, \"to be in my sanctuary... when ye offer my bread\" (ver. 7), by which, as Kliefoth and Keil explain, Israel had practically made these strangers \"keepers of Jehovah's charge,\" i.e. observers of the rites of worship prescribed by him, though observers in their way, not in his; if more can be extracted from the words, then the most they can be legitimately made to affirm (as there is no mention of the inner court) is that these \"strangers,\" in addition to obtaining access to the outer court to witness the sacrifices, or perhaps offer such for themselves, had been more or less frequently employed in performing subordinate offices towards the Levites, who were the proper priests' assistants, like the Gibeonites, whom Joshua (Joshua 9:27) made \"hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord unto this day,\" and like the Nethinim, whom, according to Ezra (Ezra 8:20), David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites (see Delitzsch, Luthardt's 'Zeitschrift fur kirchliche Wissenschaft,' 1880, p. 283). (On the phrase, \"to keep the charge of Jehovah,\" as signifying to follow his directions or comply with his prescriptions, see Numbers 9:23.) \"In the sanctuary\" explains that the prescriptions alluded to were those pertaining to the sanctuary or to the worship of Jehovah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-16. - Accordingly, that no such abuses might creep in to desecrate the temple of the future, a new Torah was promulgated concerning the persons who should have a right to participate in its services. If the \"prince\" is omitted, the reason probably was that a special section is subsequently devoted to him (Ezekiel 46:1-8). Verse 9. - The ordinance for the people. No stranger (or, alien), uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary. The publication of this edict marked a clear advance upon preceding legislation. The old Torah conceded right of access to a foreigner, though uncircumcised, on certain conditions (ver. 7); this new Torah would accord such right of access to a foreigner on no conditions. Even should he be circumcised in the flesh, unless he possessed also that which the bodily mark symbolized, viz. circumcision of heart, he must remain without. Does not this look as if Ezekiel were posterior to the priest-code, rather than vice versa, as Wellhausen contends?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-14. - The ordinance for the Levites. According to the so-called priest-code, the Levites were Levi's descendants, who were chosen by Jehovah for service in the tabernacle (Numbers 3:6-13; Numbers 16:9), to minister to the priests when these sacrificed in the tabernacle (Numbers 8:19; Numbers 18:6), and in particular to keep the charge of the tabernacle, i.e. of the house and all its vessels (Numbers 1:53), as distinguished from the charge of the sanctuary and of the altar, which pertained to Aaron and his sons alone as priests (Numbers 18:2-6, 23). The Deuteronomic code, says Wellhausen ('Geschichte Israels,' pp. 121, etc.), was unacquainted with any such distinction between Levites and priests, who, it is alleged, composed one homogeneous body, the tribe of Levi, whose members were equally empowered to officiate at the altar (Deuteronomy 10:8), the lower duties of the tabernacle having been performed by the aforesaid strangers, and the subordination of Levites to priests having first been suggested by Ezekiel (comp. Smend, 'Der Prophet Ezekiel,' p. 361, \"Der unterschied zwischen Priestern und Leviten ist hier im Enstehn begriffen\"), and first formally carried out alter the exile. This theory, however, cannot be admitted as made out in face ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) Deuteronomy 18, which (ver. 1) recognizes \"the priests\" and\" the Levites\" as constituting \"the whole tribe of Levi,\" and (ver. 3, 6) distinguishes between \"the priest\" and \"the Levite;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) 2 Samuel 15:24, which associates with Zadok the priest, the Levites as carriers of the ark;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) 1 Kings 8:4, in which the same distinction between the two bodies is recognized;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) 1 and 2 Chronicles, passim, which attest the existence of priests and Levites as separate temple officials in pre-exilic times; andNEWLINENEWLINE(5) Ezra 1:5, 62; Ezra 3:8, 10; 6:20, which show that the distinction, alleged to have been first made by Ezekiel, was well known to the first company of exiles who returned under Zerubbabel to Jerusalem, and was by them traced back to pre-exilic times (see Keil, on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:1; Curtiss's 'Levitical Priests,' pp. 22, etc.; Delitzsch, in Luthardt's 'Zeit-schrift fur kirchliche Wissensehaft,' pp. 286, etc., aud in Riehm's ' Handworterbuch des Biblischen Alterthums,' art. \"Leviten;\" Oehler, in Herzog's 'Real-Encyclopadie,' art. \"Levi\"). The question, therefore, of which Levites Ezekiel speaks in this verse, whether of those whose duties were of a menial order or of those whose functions partook of a priestly character, is not difficult to resolve. It could hardly have been the former, since in vers. 11-14 Ezekiel's Levites are represented as about to be degraded by being relegated to inferior tasks than those they had formerly performed; it must have been the latter, because in the present verse they are designated the Levites that are gone away (or, went) far from me, when Israel went astray. Now, Israel's apostasy from Jehovah and declension towards idolatry began with Solomon's unfaithfulness (1 Kings 11:4-8), and continued with greater or less intensity in every subsequent reign till the exile; it certainly cannot be restricted, as Keil and Currey propose, to Jeroboam's conduct in setting up rival sanctuaries in Dan and Bethel, with altars and priests, for the accommodation of the northern kingdom (1 Kings 12:26-33). Nor is there room for doubting, although historical notices of the fact are not abundant, that in this apostasy the priesthood largely led the way (Jeremiah 26:7, 11; 2 Kings 16:11-16; Zephaniah 1:4), becoming priests of the high places, ministering for the people at heathen altars, and so causing them to fall into iniquity (ver. 12). Hengstenberg and Plumptre suggest that the reason why these apostate priests are now called Levites was to intimate that they were no more worthy of the priesthood, and were about to be reduced to the lower ministry of the Levites so called. Consequently, under the new Torah, those among the priests (who were also Levites) who had been guilty of this flagrant wickedness (i.e., says Delitzsch, all the Aaronides who were not Zadokitos) would no more, either in themselves or their descendants, be suffered to retain the priestly office, but would be degraded to the status of ordinary Levites, and, like them, should be ministers in Jehovah's sanctuary, having charge - or, oversight (Revised Version) - at the gates of the house, and ministering, to (or, in) the house, i.e. in its courts, serving as keepers of the charge of the house (ver. 14), as watchers at the gates of the house (ver. 11), as slaughterers of the sacrificial victims (ver. 11), but should not, like their brethren who had remained faithful, be allowed to do the office of a priest, i.e. approach the altar to offer sacrifice, or to enter into the holy place (ver. 13). In this way they should bear their iniquity (vers. 10,12) - a favorite expression in the middle books of the Pentateuch (Exodus 28:38, 43; Leviticus 5:1; Leviticus 10:17; Leviticus 20:19; Numbers 5:31; Numbers 18:1), but never occurring in Deuteronomy, and meaning \"to be requited\" on account of, and make expiation for, sin and their shame and their abominations, i.e. the shame due to them for their abominations - a specially Ezekelian phrase (comp. Ezekiel 16:52, 54; Ezekiel 32:30; Ezekiel 36:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - The ordinance for the priests. That Ezekiel derived the phrase, the priests the Levites, from Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 17:9; 18:1; 24:8; 27:9) may be granted without admitting that the Levites were all priests, or that the phrase had other import than that the priests were, as the Deuteronomist says, \"sons of Levi\" (Deuteronomy 21:5; 31:9). The priesthood, at its institution, having been entrusted to Aaron and his sons (Exodus 27:20, 21; Exodus 28:1-4; Exodus 29:9, 44; Numbers 3:10; Numbers 16:40; Numbers 18:7; Numbers 25:13), on Aaron's death the high priesthood passed into the hands of Eleazar, his eldest (living) son (Numbers 20:26-28), and after Eleazar's death into those of Phinehas, his eldest son (Numbers 25:11-13). In the last days of the judges, when the ark and tabernacle stood at Shiloh, the high priesthood belonged to Eli, of the line of Ithamar (comp. 1 Samuel 14:3 and 1 Sam 22:20 with 1 Chronicles 24:3), in which line it continued till the reign of David, when it was held conjointly by Abiathar (called also Ahimelech) of the line of Ithamar, and Zadok of the line of Eleazar (2 Samuel 8:17; 2 Samuel 20:25; 1 Kings 4:4). This arrangement, however, Solomon eventually overturned, by deposing the former for espousing Adonijah's pretensions to the throne (1 Kings 1:7; 1 Kings 2:26), and from that time forward till the exile the high priesthood remained with Zadok and his sons (1 Kings 2:35; 1 Chronicles 29:22). When, therefore, it is announced to Ezekiel that his vision-sanctuary should have as priests the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of Jehovah's sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from him; the first question that arises is - To what does this allude? Kliefoth holds it cannot mean that, while Israel as a whole declined into idolatry, the Zadokite priests remained faithful to the worship of Jehovah, because the vision of Judah's idolatries granted to the prophet, in Ezekiel 8:16, revealed quite clearly that the priesthood was as much caught in the national apostasy as were the princes or the people. Nor is the language of the text perfectly satisfied by the view of Havernick, Keil, Delitzsch, and others, that it goes beck to Zadok's fidelity to the throne of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (2 Samuel 15:24-29), a fidelity exhibited also by Abiathar, or to his adherence to Solomon in preference to Adonijah (1 Kings 1:8, 39), this time without Abiathar's concurrence, rather in the face of his opposition. In neither of these instances was Zadok's fidelity specially directed towards Jehovah's sanctuary, but concerned expressly and exclusively David's throne. Hence the commendation of the Zadokites' fidelity can only signify that, while the priesthood as a body were corrupt like the people, there were among them, as among the people, some who, like Ezekiel, continued steadfast to Jehovah's sanctuary; that these faithful few were Zadokites (see Ezekiel 48:11), and that to these should be entrusted the priesthood in the new sanctuary. But, at this point, a second question starts - Was it intended to declare that the new priesthood should be Zadokites in body, i.e. in respect of lineal descent, or only in soul, i.e. in respect of moral and religious excellence? The former is contended by Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, and others, who see in the vision-sanctuary a plan of the second, or post-exilic, temple, and in its ordinances a program for the establishment of the Levitical hierarchy; but this contention shatters itself on the fact that no proof exists either that the second temple was constructed after Ezekiel's as a model, or that those who served in it were exclusively flesh and blood Zadokites. The latter opinion, favored by Kliefoth, appears the more correct, that moral and spiritual resemblance to the sons of Zadok should form the first qualification for the priesthood in this ideal sanctuary of the future (see note at the end of Ezekiel 48.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-31. - The duties and emoluments of the priests. Verse 17. - Beginning with their attire when engaged in temple service, this verse states, in a general way, that the priests should be clothed with linen garments, as the priests were under the Law (Exodus 28:40-43; Exodus 39:27-29; Leviticus 6:10), with this difference, that whereas under the Law the terms employed were שֵׁשׁ, the white byssus of Egypt, and בַּד, \"fine white linen,\" here the word is פִּשְׁתֶּה, or \"flax\" - a difference which assists newer critics to perceive in the so-called priest-code a refinement on Ezekiel, and therefore an evidence that the priest-cede arose later than Ezekiel But if the so-called priest-code had already indicated that the linen for priests' garments should be of the finest quality, Ezekiel may have felt there was no occasion for him to use other than the generic term for \"linen,\" which פִעשׁתֶּה (pishteh) seems to have been (comp. Leviticus 13:47, 48, 52, 59; Deuteronomy 22:11; Jeremiah 13:1). That this was so is suggested by the statement that no wool, צֶמֶר, \"perhaps so called from its being shorn off\" (Gesenius), should come upon them whiles they ministered in the gates of the inner court, or within the court itself, or the house - the contrast being between what was of vegetable and what was of animal production. The reason for the prohibition of wool is hinted at in ver. 18 - it was apt to cause sweat, and thus entail impurity; the clean white linen, on the other hand, was designed both for hygienic reasons and as an emblem of purity (comp. Revelation 19:8, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - In particular the priests should have linen bonnets upon their heads - literally, linen tires shall be upon their heads - and linen breeches upon their loins. To infer from the use of מִגְבָּעות in Leviticus 8:13 and of פְאֵר here for the head-dress of the priests, that Ezekiel was composed before Leviticus, is not convincing. Smend explains the latter term as the customary headdress of common people, and the former as a specially ornamental tiara or turban. Gesenius reverses this meaning, making the former the ordinary round cap, and the latter a tiara (see for the former, Exodus 28:40; Exodus 29:9; Exodus 39:28; and for the latter, Exodus 39:28; Isaiah 61:10; Ezekiel 24:17, 23). In addition, the priests should not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat; literally, should not gird themselves in, or with sweat, which was another way of forbidding them to wear woollen clothing, which might cause them to sweat and so lead to uncleanness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - When the priests retired from the inner court, and before they passed into the outer court to mingle with the people, they were enjoined to lay aside their official robes, depositing them in the holy chambers already described (Ezekiel 42:1-14), and to put on other, i.e. their ordinary, clothes (comp. Leviticus 6:11). The reason for this injunction was that they might not sanctify the people (comp. Ezekiel 46:20) through the people's coming in contact with their garments. These, being in a manner, i.e. ceremonially, holy, would impart to the people a levitical or ritualistic sanctity which would disqualify them, for a time, at least, from attending to the common duties of life, as under the Law those were who touched the sacrificial flesh (Leviticus 6:18, 27), the altar (Exodus 29:37), and the vessels of the sanctuary (Exodus 30:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The next rubric concerned the mode in which the priests should wear their hair. It should neither be shaved nor worn long, thus avoiding excess on either side (compare for the first, Leviticus 21:5; and for the second, Leviticus 10:6; Leviticus 21:10, Revised Version), but should merely be polled. The obligation to let the hair grow freely was imposed upon the Nazarite only during the period of his vow (Numbers 6:5). The verb \"to poll,\" or \"cut\" (כָּסַם), occurs nowhere else. Smend thinks what is here denied to the priests collectively is in the priest-code denied solely to the high priest (Leviticus 21:10, Revised Version; compare, however, Leviticus 10:6, Revised Version), and discovers in this a sign of the later origin of Leviticus. Ezekiel's raising the priesthood as a body to the rank of the high priest, of whom in connection with this temple is no trace, rather proves Ezekiel to have been later than Leviticus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The prohibition of wine to the priests when engaged in temple service accorded with Mosaic legislation (Leviticus 10:9). Total abstinence at other times was not enjoined.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - As to marriage (since the priests in Ezekiel's \"house\" were no more expected to be celibates than were those employed about Moses' tabernacle or Solomon's temple), they were forbidden to marry widows (which the Levitical priests were not, though the high priest was) or divorced women, and allowed to wed only virgins of the house of Israel, or (the sole exception) widows of such as had been priests (compare with the priest-code, Leviticus 21:7, 13, 14). Ezekiel's enactment discovers two variations - first, that it does not formally forbid to the priests marriage with a harlot; and, second, that it sanctions marriage with a priest's widow. But the first was implied in the prohibition of marriage with an adulteress, and the second was a sign of the higher sanctity of the priesthood belonging to Ezekiel's temple. Hence, so far from indicating the priority of Ezekiel, it rather points to the priority of Leviticus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - Among the priests' official duties four things are prescribed.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The education of the people in the fundamental principles of their religion, viz. that a distinction existed between the \"holy\" and \"profane,\" or \"common,\" and in the practical application of that principle, the art of discerning between the \"unclean\" and the \"clean.\" This duty had been laid upon the priests of Mosaism (Leviticus 10:10; Deuteronomy 24:8; Deuteronomy 33:10), but in the last years of the monarchy had been neglected (Ezekiel 26:26; comp. Malachi 2:7-9).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The administration of justice in all disputes arising out of and connected with the practices of their religion. This office had pertained to the priests under the Law (Numbers 5:14-31; Deuteronomy 17:8-13; Deuteronomy 19:17; Deuteronomy 21:5), and was exercised in pre-exilic times (Hosea 4:6; Micah 3:11; Isaiah 28:7; Jeremiah 18:18), though not always in accord-ante with Jehovah s judgments.

This they should do both by resting on the seventh day and by offering the sabbath sacrifices, the showbread, and the burnt offering; both of which things the priests under the Law had been commanded to do (see Exodus 20:8-11; Exodus 31:13-17: Leviticus 23:3; Leviticus 24:8; Numbers 28:9), but had not done (Ezekiel 20:12, 13, 20, 21; Ezekiel 22:8; Ezekiel 23:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-27. - Regulations are next given for preserving the priesthood from defilement through coming in contact with the dead, and for removing such defilement in case of its having been contracted. As under the Law, so in the ideal constitution of Ezekiel, the priests should not be at liberty to contract ceremonial impurity through touching a corpse except in the case of near relations (comp. Leviticus 21:1-4). That neither in Leviticus nor in Ezekiel is the priest's wife among the excepted is surprising, and hardly to be explained, with Knobel, on the ground that a wife is not a blood-relation, since according to the Divine conception of marriage husband and wife are one (Genesis 2:24), but either by holding, with Keil, that the wife, who stands nearer her husband than any of the relatives named, was viewed as included under the phrase, \"and for his kin that is near unto him\" (Leviticus 21:2), or by supposing it self-evident that such defilement could not be avoided in the case of a wife and was therefore tacitly allowed. Smend, as usual, finds signs of Ezekiel's priority to the priest-code, first in the circumstance that Ezekiel regarded it as perfectly natural that a priest should sorrow for his wife (Ezekiel 24:15-18), which showed he had no acquaintance with Leviticus 21; and secondly, in the fact that Leviticus 21:11 prohibits absolutely to the high priest all contact with a corpse, which, it is argued, betrays a greater strictness than existed in the days of Ezekiel. But as the prohibition in Leviticus 21:11 applies only to the high priest, who in Ezekiel's temple has no place, an argument as to which of the books had priority of origin cannot properly be founded on so insecure a Basis. Knobel remarks on Leviticus 21:1-4 that \"among the Greeks, priests and priestesses remained at a distance from funerals (Plato, 'De Legg.,' 12. p. 947); while among the Romans ought the Flamen dialis to touch no corpse (Gell., 10:15), the augur perform no funeral rites (Tacit., 'Ann.,' 1:31), and the pontifex accompany no funeral procession (Die Cass., 56:31); not at all should he behold a dead body (Serv., 'Ad AEn.,' 6:176),and in case he had occasion to pronounce a funeral oration, a curtain should hang between him and the corpse.\" As to the cleansing of a defiled priest, that should be conducted in accordance with the customary regulations (comp. Numbers 19.),with this difference - that on the termination of the ordinary rites, which extended over seven days, an additional seven days, according to Havernick and Keil (though Hengstenberg and Plumptre decide for only one heptade), should elapse, at the end of which, on the presentation of a sin offering, he should be restored to service in the inner sanctuary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-31 state the emoluments which should Be enjoyed by the priests. Verse 28. - The Authorized Version conveys the impression that the first portion of the priests' sustenance should be derived from the sin offering, which is not mentioned till the following verse. And it shall be unto them for an inheritance ought rather to be rendered, and there shall be to them (what shall be) for an inheritance; or more simply, and they shall have an inheritance (Revised Version), which, it is next declared, as in the Law (Numbers 18:20; Deuteronomy 10:9; Deuteronomy 18:1, 2), should be Jehovah, and not any territorial possession or tribal tract such as should be assigned to the other tribes (see Ezekiel 48.). Smend thinks Ezekiel was scarcely accurate in describing the priests as landless in the sense intended by the Deuteronomist and the priest-code, since in Ezekiel 45:4 they are, after all, furnished with a plot of ground on which to build their houses and erect their sanctuary; whilst Wellhansen ('Gesehichte Israels,' p. 165) holds the priest-code to have somewhat romanced in adopting the same language about the Aaronides and Levites, since, if they really did obtain forty-eight cities, \"what were these if not a lot and a land tract, and that too a comparatively great and important one?\" Neither view stands in need of refutation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - To the priests should be allocated, in addition, what already had been assigned them by the Law for their support, the meat (or, meal) offering, consisting of flour, corn, or bread (comp. Leviticus 2:1-16; Leviticus 6:16; Numbers 28:12, 13), and the sin offering (see Leviticus 6:25-29; Leviticus 7:6; Numbers 18:9, 10), and the trespass (or, guilt) offering (comp. Leviticus 7:28-38), and every dedicated (or, devoted) thing in Israel (see Leviticus 27:21; Numbers 18:14). The burnt offering is omitted, because it was entirely consumed upon the altar, with the exception of the hide or skin, which under the Law became a perquisite of the officiating priest (Leviticus 7:8). That Ezekiel is silent about this, while the requirement of Leviticus 7:30, that the priest should obtain the breast with the right shoulder of every fire offering, goes beyond the prescription of Deuteronomy 18:3, that the shoulder, two cheeks, and the maw should be the priest's portion, is regarded by Wellhausen and Smend as a proof that Ezekiel stands between Deuteronomy and the priest-code. But as Ezekiel does not condescend upon the particular parts which should be reserved from the fire offerings, it is impossible to say whether he held with the Deuteronomist or the writer of the priest-code, supposing them to be different; and, inasmuch as Leviticus 7:30 speaks of an offerings, by fire that was first paid to Jehovah and by him afterwards handed over to Aaron and his sons, while Deuteronomy 18:3 treats of the dues which should be paid by the people directly to the priests, it is clear that both practices may have existed together instead of the one (the former) coming in as an advance upon the other (the latter); see Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - A further portion of the priests' emoluments is stated as the first of all the firstfruits of all things - or, of everything (Revised Version), as e.g. of corn, oil, must, and wool - and every oblation (תְּרוּמָה) - or, heave offering - of all - or, of everything - with the first of the people's dough; or, coarse meal; which again re-echoes the provisions of the Law, the first of the firstfruits being specified in Exodus 23:19; Exodus 34:26; Numbers 18:13; Deuteronomy 18:4; the oblation, or terumah (Hebrew), in Numbers 15:19; Numbers 18:19; and the dough, or coarse meal, or groats, in Numbers 15:20, 21. Ezekiel's supposed (Wellhausen, Smend) silence as regards the firstlings of cattle, which in the book of the covenant (Exodus 22:29) and in the Deuteronomist (Deuteronomy 15:19) are to be eaten by the offerer, but in the priest-code (Numbers 18:21) belong to the priests, is imaginary. The first of all the firstfruits of everything cannot surely mean of everything except cattle. If Ezekiel does not give the tenths of the tithes to the priests, he still assigns them to the sanctuary (see Ezekiel 45:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel44:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The commandment of the Mosaic Law is here renewed against eating the flesh of any fowl or beast that had either died a natural death or been mangled in the killing (comp. Leviticus 17:15; Leviticus 22:8) - a commandment which, while enjoined specially upon the priests (Leviticus 22:8), was equally binding upon all (Exodus 20:31; Deuteronomy 14:21).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.45":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - The portions of land that should be allotted to the sanctuary, the city, and the prince. Verse 1. - Moreover, When ye shall divide by lot the land (literally, and in your causing the land to fall) for inheritance. As the territory of Canaan had been originally divided by lot among the twelve tribes after the conquest (comp. Numbers 26:55; Numbers 33:54; Joshua 13:6, etc.), this same method of allocating the soil amongst the new community should be followed on a second time taking possession of it after the exile. Currey believes the phrase, \"divide by lot,\" \"does not imply anything like casting lots, but is equivalent to our notion of allotment, the several portions being assigned by rule.\" There is, however, little doubt \"lots\" were cast to determine, if not the actual size, at least the precise situation, of each tribe's territory (see REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschNumbers 26:54 Keil and 'Pulpit Commentary' on Numbers 26:54). That no such methodical distribution of Canaan ever took place, or for that matter could hays taken place amongst the returned exiles, should be proof sufficient that the prophet here moves in the region of the ideal and symbolical rather than of the real and literal. Ye shall offer an oblation -literally, lift up a heave offering (comp. Ezekiel 44:80; Exodus 25:2, 3; Exodus 29:28; Exodus 30:13, 14; Leviticus 7:14, 32; Leviticus 22:12; Numbers 15:19; Numbers 18:24) - unto the Lord, an holy portion of the land; literally, a holy (portion) from the land. Very significantly, in the new partition of Palestine the Lord's portion should be the first to be marked off and solemnly dedicated to Jehovah for the purposes to be forthwith specified. Those who, like Wellhansen and Smend, perceive in this allotment of land to Jehovah, and therefore to the priests, a contradiction to Ezekiel 44:28, omit to notice first that Jehovah required some place on which his sanctuary might be erected, and the priests some ground on which to build houses for themselves; and secondly, that, so far as the priests were concerned, the laud was given by the people, not to them, but to Jehovah, and by him to them (comp. on Ezekiel 44:28). The exact site of this terumah, or \"holy portion,\" is afterwards indicated (Ezekiel 48:8); meanwhile its dimensions are recorded. The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. Whether \"reeds\" or \"cubits\" should be supplied after \"thousand\" has divided expositors. Bottcher, Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Smend decide for \"cubits,\" principally on the grounds that \"cubits\" are mentioned in ver. 2; that \"cubits\" have been the usual measure hitherto, even (as they contend) in Ezekiel 42:16; and that otherwise the dimensions of this sacred territory must have been colossal, in fact, out of all proportion to the Holy Land, viz. about 720 square miles (25,000 reeds, or 42.5 miles, × 10,000 reeds, or 17 miles, = 722.5 square miles). Havernick, Keil, Kliefoth, Currey, and Plumptre favor \"reeds,\" chiefly for the reasons that in ver. 2 \"cubits\" are specified, and are therefore to be regarded as exceptional; that the customary measuring instrument throughout has been a reed (see Ezekiel 40:5; Ezekiel 42:16); and that the dimensions, which Ezekiel designed should be colossal (comp. Ezekiel 40:2), correspond exactly with the measurements afterwards given in Ezekiel 48, if these he in reeds, but not if they be in cubits. As to the breadth of this terumah from east to west, Hitzig, Keil, Smend, Schroder, and Plumptre follow the LXX. (εἴκοσι χιλιάδας) in substituting 20,000 for 10,000, considering that the space referred to in ver. 3 appears as if meant to be taken from an already measured larger area, which could only be that of ver. 1 - the portion in ver. 1 being the whole territory assigned to the priests and Levites, and that in ver. 3 the allotment for the priests. Kliefoth, however, contends that no necessity exists for tampering with the text, and certainly if vers. 1-4 be regarded as descriptive of the priests' portion only, and מִן in the phrase, \"of this measure\" (וּמִן־חַמִּדָּה הַזּלֺאת), in ver. 8 be rendered \"according to\" - a sense it may have (see Gesenius, sub voce), the supposed difficulty disappears. In this case the demonstrative this in the last clause will refer to the priests' portion exclusively; in the former ease, to the whole portion of the priests and Levites. That Ezekiel 48:14 declares the Levites' portion to be \"holy unto the land\" does not prove it must have been included in the holy terumah of ver. 1 Nor does this concession follow, as will appear, from ver. 7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Of this district, either of 25,000 × 10,000, or 25,000 × 20,000 reeds, according to the view taken of ver. 1, there should be measured off for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth. The supplement here also, Keil, Kliefoth, Plumptre, and others consider to be \"reeds,\" since obviously the whole temple with its precincts is intended (Ezekiel 42:16-20), though Hengstenberg and Schroder prefer \"cubits,\" holding the sanctuary to be the temple buildings enclosed within the outer court well (Ezekiel 40.). The free space of fifty cubits round about for the suburbs (or, open places) thereof seems to indicate that the larger area was that alluded to by the prophet. That the term מִגְדָשׁ. occurs more frequently in the so-called priest-code (Leviticus 25:84; Numbers 35:2, 3, 4, 5, 7; Joshua 14:4; Joshua 21:2, 3, 8, 11, 13, etc.) and in the Chronicles (1 Chronicles 5:16; 1 Chronicles 6:35, 37; 1 Chronicles 13:2; 2 Chronicles 11:14; 2 Chronicles 31:19) than in Ezekiel (see Ezekiel 27:28; Ezekiel 48:15, 17) is a fact; but on this fact cannot be founded an argument for the priority of Ezekiel, since it rather points to Ezekiel's acquaintance with such \"suburbs\" in connection with priestly and Levitical cities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And of this measure shalt thou measure. As above explained, if מִן, \"of,\" be taken as equivalent to \"from,\" i.e. deducted from, then the whole \"measure\" in ver. 1 must have been 25,000 × 20,000 reeds; but if, as Ewald translates, it may signify \"after,\" \"according to,\" then the text in ver. 1 will not require to be altered (see on ver. 1), and the present verse will be merely a reiteration of the statement in ver. 1 that the priests' portion should be 25,000 × 10,000 reeds, preparatory to the additional notification that in it should be the sanctuary and the most holy place, or rather, the sanctuary which is most holy (Revised Version). The exact position of the sanctuary in the priests' portion is afterwards stated to have been in the midst (see Ezekiel 48:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The holy portion of the land just defined (ver. 3) should be reserved for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, i.e. of the inner court, who were privileged to draw near to Jehovah in altar ministrations (comp. Ezekiel 44:15; Exodus 28:43; Exodus 30:20; Numbers 16:5, 40), as distinguished from the Levites, who were only\" ministry of the house\" (ver. 5), i.e. guardian, of the temple and assistants in its outer court services. As such this holy portion should serve the twofold purpose of providing- for the priests a place for their houses in which they might dwell, and an holy place for the sanctuary, in which they should minister.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A portion of similar dimensions should likewise be marked off for the Levites, for themselves, for a possession of twenty chambers; better, for a possession unto themselves for twenty chambers (Revised Version). Ewald, Hitzig, and Smend, as usual, follow the LXX.  αὐτοῖς εἰς κατάσχεσινπόλεις τοῦ κατοικεῖν), and amend the text after Numbers 35:2; Joshua 21:2, so as to read \"cities (עָרִים) to dwell in;\" and with them Keil agrees, only substituting \"gates\" (שְׁעָרִים) instead of \"cities.\" Kliefoth and Curroy retain the word \"chambers \"as in the text, and think the \"chambers\" and the \"land\" were two distinct possessions of the Levites, the chambers having been within (see Ezekiel 40:17, 18) as the land was without the sanctuary. Rosenmüller, Havernick, Hengstenberg, and Schroder decide for \"chambers,\" or \"courts,\" rows of dwellings standing outside the sanctuary as the priests' chambers were located within. Havernick supposes that along with these, which were obviously designed to be employed when the Levites were on duty, there may have been other Levitical towns and dwellings, Hengstenberg conceives them as having been \"barracks for the Levites, the inhabitants of which used the twentieth part of the land assigned to them as pasturage.\" Unfavorable to the first view is the fact that it requires the text to be altered. Against the second is its awkward dividing of the verse and unexpected interjection of a reference to cells within the sanctuary while speaking of the land without. The third, while not free from difficulty as taking לְשָׁכֹת to be equivalent to \"cell-buildings,\" is perhaps the best.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In addition to the holy terumah for the priests and the portion for the Levites, should be marked off as the possession of the city a third tract of territory, five thousand (reeds) broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against - rather, side by side with (Revised Version), \"parallel to\" (Keil) - the oblation of the holy portion. That is to say, it should lie upon the south, as the Levites' territory lay upon the north of the priests' portion. Adding the 10,000 reeds of breadth for the Levites' domain, the 10,000 for the priests' land, and the 5000 for the city quarter, makes a total breadth of 25,000 reeds; so that the tract in which all these were included was a square. That the portion for the city should be for the whole house of Israel implied that it should be communal property, belonging to no tribe in particular, but to all the tribes together - in modern phrase should be \"common good, ein Volksgut (Kliefoth), which should neither be confiscated by kingly rapacity (comp. Jeremiah 22:13) nor invaded by individual and private appropriation, but retained for the use of the inhabitants generally (see Ezekiel 48:18, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And a portion shall be (or, ye shall appoint) for the prince. As to situation, his portion should lie on both sides of the holy portion (or portions, i.e. of the priests and of the Levites; see Ezekiel 48:20-22), and of the possession, or portion, of the city; should stretch exactly in front or alongside of these, i.e. from north to south; and should extend on the one side westward (to the Mediterranean), and on the other side eastward (to the Jordan). The concluding clause, And the length shall be over against (לְעֻמות, a plural form, occurring only here) one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border, though somewhat obscure, obviously imports that the prince's portion, on both sides of the holy terumah, should extend lengthwise, i.e. from east to west, along the side of one of the portions assigned to the tribes; in other words, should be bounded on the north and south by the tribal territories of Judah and Benjamin (see Ezekiel 48:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - My princes shall no more oppress my people. That Israel in former times had suffered from the oppressions and exactions of her kings, from Solomon downwards, as Samuel had predicted she would (1 Samuel 8:10-18), was matter of history (see 1 Kings 12:4, 10, 11; 2 Kings 23:35), and was perhaps partly explained, though not justified, by the fact that the kings had no crown lands assigned them for their support. This excuse, however, for regal tyranny should in future cease, as a sufficient portion of land should be allocated to the prince and his successors, who accordingly should give, or leave, the rest of the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. The use of \"princes\" does not show, as Hengstenberg asserts, that \"under the ideal unity of the prince in Ezekiel, a numerical plurality is included,\" and that \"these who understand by the prince merely the Messiah must here do violence to the text;\" but simply, as Kliefoth explains, that Ezekiel was thinking of Israel's past kings, and contrasting with them the rulers Israel might have in the future, without affirming that these should be many or one (see on Ezekiel 44:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-17. - The oblations of the people to the prince for the sanctuary.

Ezekiel 7:11, 23; Ezekiel 8:17: Jeremiah 6:7; Jeremiah 20:8; Habakkuk 1:3) or by exactions - literally, expulsions, or drivings of persons out of their possessions, such as had been practiced on Naboth by Ahab (1 Kings 21.) - but levied with judgment and justice, which, besides, should regulate their whole behavior towards their subjects (comp. 2 Samuel 8:15; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 32:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The exhortation addressed to the princes to practice justice and judgment now extends itself so as to include their subjects, who are required, in all their commercial dealings, to have just balances and just measures - a just ephah for dry goods, and a just bath for liquids (compare the prescriptions in Leviticus 19:35, 36 and Deuteronomy 25:13 - 15, and contrast the practices in Hosea 12:7; Amos 8:5; Micah 6:10, 11; see also Proverbs 16:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The ephah (a word of Egyptian origin) and the bath shall be of one measure. That is, each was to be the tenth part of an homer (see Leviticus 27:16; Numbers 11:32), or cot (כֹר, κόρος, 1 Kings 4:22; Luke 16:7), which appears to have contained about seventy-five gallons, or thirty-two pecks. The homer (or, cheroot) is to be distinguished from the omer of Exodus 16:36, which was the tenth part of an ephah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The shekel shall be twenty garahs. This ordained that the standard for money weights should remain as it had been fixed by the Law (Exodus 30:13; Leviticus 27:25; Numbers 3:47). The \"shekel\" (or \"weight,\" from שָׁקַל, \"to weigh;\" compare the Italian lira, the French livre out of the Latin libra, and the English Found sterling) was a piece of silver whose value, originally determined by weight, became gradually fixed at the definite sum of twenty \"gerahs,\" beans, or grains (from גָּרַר, \"to roll\"). The \"gerah,\" value two pence, was the smallest silver coin; the \"shekel,\" therefore, was forty pence, or 3s. 4d. Commentators are divided as to how the second half of this verse should be understood: twenty shekel, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels shall be your maneh. The \"maneh\" (or \"portion,\" from מָנָה, \"to be divided\"), which occurs only here and in 1 Kings 10:17; Ezra 2:69; and Nehemiah 7:71, 72 - \"that is to say, only in books written during the Captivity or subsequent to it\" (Keil) - was probably the same coin as the Greek rains (μνᾶ), though its weight may have somewhat differed. A comparison of 1 Kings 10:17 with 2 Chronicles 9:16 shows that a maneh was equal to a hundred shekels, which cannot be made to harmonize with the statement in this verse without supposing either that an error has crept in through transcription, or that the chronicler has employed the late Greek style of reckoning, in which one mina is equivalent to a hundred drachmas. Again, the Hebrew and Attic talents, when ex-stained, fail to solve the problem as to how the text should be rendered. The Hebrew talent, כִּכָּר, contained 3000 sacred or Mosaic shekels according to Exodus 38:25, 26; and the Attic talon 60 minas, each of 100 drachmas, i.e. 6000 drachmas, or 3000 drachmas, each of which again was equal to a Hebrew shekel. Hence the Attic mina must have been one-sixtieth part of 3000, i.e. 50 shekels, which once more fails to correspond with Ezekiel's notation. What this notation is depends on how the clauses should be connected. If with \"and,\" as Ewald, following the Targumists, thinks, Ezekiel is supposed to have ordained that in the future the maneh should be, not 50, but 60 (20 + 25 -1- 15) shekels - the weight of the 'Babylonian mana ('Records of the Past,' 4:97, second series); only, if he so intended, one sees not why he should have adopted this roundabout method of expression instead of simply stating that henceforth the maneh should be sixty shekels If with \"or,\" as Michaelis, Gesenius, Hitzig, and Hengstenberg prefer, then the prophet is regarded as asserting that in the future three manehs of varying values should be current - one of gold, another of silver, and a third of copper (Hitzig), or all of the same metal, but of different magnitudes (Michaelis); and this arrangement might well have been appointed for the future, although no historical trace can be found of any such manehs of twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen shekels respectively having been in circulation either among the Hebrews or among foreign peoples. Kliefoth pronounces both solutions unsatisfactory, but has nothing better to offer. Keil supposes a corruption of the text of old standing, for the correction of which we are as yet without materials. Bertheau and Havernick follow the LXX. (Cod. Alex.), Οἱ πέντε σίκλοι πέντε καὶ δέκα  σίκλοι δέκα καὶ πεντήκοντα σίκλοι ἡ μνᾶ ἐσται ὑμῖν, \"The five shekel (piece) shall be five shekels, and the ten shekel (piece) shall be tea shekels, end fifty shekels shall your maneh be;\" but Hitzig's judgment on this proposal, with which Kliefoth and Keil agree, will most likely be deemed correct, that \"it carries on the face of it the probability of its resting upon nothing more than an attempt to bring the text into harmony with the ordinary value of the maneh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-15. - The offerings the people' should present are next specified.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Of wheat, the sixth part of an ophah of (out, of, or from) an homer; i.e. the sixtieth part of an homer, equal to about one-tenth of a bushel (ver. 13).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Of barley, the same (ver. 13).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Of oil, a tenth part of a bath out of the cor, or homer of ten Baths, i.e. the hundredth part of every homer, equal to a little more than half a gallon (ver. 14).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Of the flock, one lamb or kid (שֶׂה, meaning either) out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat - or well-watered (see Genesis 13:10) - pastures of Israel, i.e. one of every two hundred, and never the worst, but always the best. These oblations should be made for the maintenance of the necessary sacrificial worship in the new temple, for the meal, burnt, and peace or thank offerings that should there be presented to make reconciliation or atonement for the house of Israel. Compared with the offerings prescribed by the Law of Moses, these discover important variations.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Of flour, the Law demanded one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour with a lamb (Exodus 29:40), with a ram two-tenths (Numbers 15:6), with a bullock three-tenths (Numbers 15:9); of wheat and of barley Ezekiel's Torah requires one-sixteenth of an ephah for each, i.e. one-third in all.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Of oil, the Mosaic ordinance was, with a lamb should be presented one-fourth of a bin, i.e. one-twenty-fourth of a bath; with a ram, one-third of a bin, i.e. one-eighteenth of a bath; with a bullock one-half of a hin, i.e. one-twelfth of a bath. Ezekiel's ordinance was in every case one-tenth of a bath.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Of animals, the Pentateuchal legislation left the necessary victims, whether rams, goats, or bullocks, to be provided by the offerers at their own free-will, stipulating as compulsory only the firstborn of the flocks and herds (Exodus 13:2, 12; Exodus 22:29, 30; Leviticus 27:26; Numbers 3:13; Numbers 8:17; Deuteronomy 15:19), the first ripe fruits of the earth (Exodus 22:29; Numbers 18:12), and the tithes, or tenths, of seed, fruit, the herd and flock (Leviticus 27:30-33); the Ezekelian omits the latter, but ordains in lieu of the former that one animal out of every two hundred in every flock shall be obligatory on Jehovah's worshippers. Thus the demands of Ezekiel's Torah surpass those of the earlier or Mosaic Torah in quantity as well as quality. That these demands are definitely specified does not prove they should partake rather of the nature of a tax than of a free-will offering. That they were not to be regarded as taxes is shown by the absence of any allusion to penalties for neglect of payment; that they were designed to be looked upon as free-will offerings is plain from the circumstance that Jehovah never supposes for a moment that these generous offerings will be withheld; and perhaps all that is really signified by them is that the liberality of Jehovah's people in the future age should greatly exceed that which had been practiced at any former time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - All the people of the land shall give (literally, shall be for) this oblation (or, terumah) for the prince in Israel. Assuming that the prince here refers to the ordinary civil magistrate, Hengstenborg founds on this an argument in support of state Churches: \"This is also the general doctrine, that the magistrate shall take first of all from the taxes levied the means for the proper observance of Divine worship.\" But if the oblations above referred to were not properly taxes, and if the prince was not properly an earthly sovereign of the ordinary type, this argument falls to the ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The prince, as receiver-general of the people's offerings, should devote them to maintaining (literally, it should be upon him, and so form part of his duty to maintain) the sacrificial worship of the new temple, in the feasts (הַגִּים, or joyous celebrations), and in the now moons, and in the sabbaths, and generally in all solemnities (מועָדִים, or appointed times, hence festal seasons) of the house of Israel (comp. 1 Kings 8:62; Ezra 7:17), that thereby he might make reconciliation (or, atonement) for the house of Israel. This combination of the kingly and priestly offices in the person of the prince (David) obviously typified the similar union of the same offices in David's Son (Christ).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-25. - These verses allude to the institution of a new feast-cycle, whose deviations from that of the Pentateuch will be best exhibited in the course of exposition. Whether three festivals are referred to or only two is debated by expositors. Fairbairn, Havernick, Ewald, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre decide for three - the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20), the Passover (vers. 21-24), and the Feast of Tabernacles (ver. 25). Kliefoth, Smend, and Curtsy find only two a Passover and a Feast of Tabernacles. Hengstenberg sees in the solemnities of the first and seventh days of the new year a special consecration service for the new temple, not to be repeated, corresponding to the dedication of the tabernacle on the first day of the first month (Exodus 40:1, 17), or of the Solomonic temple in the seventh month (1 Kings 8:2; 2 Chronicles 7:8), and in imitation of which the post-exilic temple was dedicated, probably on the first day of the year (Ezra 6:16-22). Against the notion of a special dedication service, however, stand the factsNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the temple had been already consecrated by the entrance into it of the glory of the Lord (Ezekiel 43:4); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the service here described differs in respect either of time or ritual or both from every one of the three cited dedications. Between the two other views the difference is slight. If the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20) was distinct from the Passover, it was still, by the ritual of the seventh and fourteenth days of the first month (vers. 20, 22), so closely connected with the Passover as practically to form a preparation for and introduction to it. Then the circumstance that the proper ceremonial for the new moon is afterwards described (Ezekiel 46:6) favors the proposal to regard the rites in vers. 18-20 as a part of the Passover festival; while this view, if adopted, will explain the omission from ver. 25 of all mention of the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh month (Leviticus 23:24; Numbers 29:1), and of the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month (Leviticus 23:27; Numbers 29:7), with which the autumn festival was usually preceded, by showing that in lieu of these a sacrificial observance had been prefixed to the Passover on the first and seventh days of the first month. Smend's theory, that \"Ezekiel's feast-calendar divides the ecclesiastical year into two halves, each of which begins with a re. conciliation ceremony (or expiatory sacrifice) on the first days of the first and seventh months respectively,\" would lend confirmation to the above view, were it not that the theory in question is based on an alteration of the text in ver. 20 (see Exposition). Verse 18. - Thus saith the Lord God. The usual solemn introduction prefixed to Divine enactments (comp. ver. 9; Ezekiel 43:19; Ezekiel 44:6, 9; Ezekiel 46:1, 16). In the first month, in the first day of the month (comp. Genesis 8:13). That the first month, Abib, was intended is apparent from ver. 21, compared with Exodus 12:2; Numbers 9:1. Under the Mosaic Torah, the Passover began on the tenth day of the first month by the selection of a lamb (Exodus 12:3-6), corresponding to which the great Day of Atonement in the seventh month fell upon the tenth day (Leviticus 23:27). In the Torah of Ezekiel, the ceremonies introducing and leading up to the Passover should begin with the first day of the month, as under the Law the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh mouth practically began the solemnities which culminated in the Feast of Tabernacles. A young bullock without blemish should form the sacrificial offering on this first day of the year, according to the ordinance published by Ezekiel; that promulgated by the Hebrew lawgiver appointed for new moons generally, in addition to the burnt and meat offerings, a he-goat for a sin offering (Numbers 28:15), and particularly for the first day of the seventh month, in addition to the regular burnt and meat offerings, one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs for a burnt offering, meat offerings of flour and oil for each of these animals, and a he-goat for a sin offering (Numbers 29:2-6). The object for which the Mosaic offerings were presented was to make atonement for the worshippers; the Ezekelian sacrifices should stand in more immediate relation to the place of worship, and be designed to cleanse the sanctuary from such defilement, to be afterwards mentioned, as might be contracted from the presence in it of erring men (ver. 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The mode in which this act of purgation should be performed is next described. The blood of the sin offering should by the priest be put (not sprinkled) upon the posts of the house, i.e. upon the posts or pillars of the door connecting the holy place with the holy of holies (Ezekiel 41:21), and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar of burnt offering in the inner court (Ezekiel 43:14), and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court, not of the eastern gate only, as Hitzig suggests, but of all the three gates (Ezekiel 40:29, 33, 36). Compare Ezekiel 43:20, and the procedure in sin offerings under the Law, which directed that in certain cases part of the blood should be put by the priest's finger upon the horns of the altar, and the rest poured out beside the bottom of the altar (Exodus 29:12; Leviticus 4:7), while in other cases it should be sprinkled before the veil of the sanctuary (Leviticus 4:6, 17), and on the great Day of Atonement seven times even on and before the mercy-seat, and on the altar of incense (Leviticus 16:14, 18, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The same ceremony should be repeated on the seventh day of the month, not on the first day of the seventh month, as Smend proposes, in accordance with the λήψῃ, and on the ground that \"the seventh day of (the same) mouth\" would have been in Hebrew בְּשִׁבְעָה לֶחֹדֶשׁ, as in Ezekiel 1:1; Ezekiel 30:20; at the same time admitting that בַּחֹדֶשׁ is sometimes used (Numbers 10:11), though not (except in this verse) by Ezekiel. The sin offerings in question should be made for (or, on account of, מִן, \"away from,\" expressing the reason why anything is done) every one that erreth, and for him that is simple, i.e. for such transgressors as should have gone aside from the straight path through ignorance or foolishness, the \"simple\" man being here, as in Proverbs 7:7; Proverbs 22:3; Proverbs 27:12, one easily enticed or persuaded to do evil. For such offenders the Law of Moses provided means of expiation (Leviticus 2:2, etc.; Leviticus 5:15; Numbers 15:27); for the presumptuous sinner, who despised the word of the Lord and violated his commandment, only one doom remained, to be cut off from among his people (Numbers 15:30; Deuteronomy 17:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - With the fourteenth day of the month, the day appointed by the Law of Moses for the killing of the Paschal lamb (Exodus 12:6), the Passover (חַפָסַה with the article, the well-known festival of that name) should commence. Though the selection of the lamb upon the tenth day of the first month is not specified, it may be assumed that this would be implied in the appointment of a Passover which should begin on the day already legalized by the Mosaic Torah. According to Wellhausen and Smend, the first mention of the Passover occurs in Deuteronomy 16:2, 5, 6, and the next in 2 Kings 23:22; but this can only be maintained by declaring Exodus 34:25, which occurs in the so-called \"Book of the Covenant\" - a pre-Deuteronomic work - \"a gloss,\" and by relegating Exodus 12. to the \"priest-code\" for no other reason than that it alludes to the Passover (vers. 11, 21, 27, 43) - a principle of easy application, and capable of being used to prove anything. Smend likewise regards it as strange that the Passover should be made to commence on the fourteenth of the month, and not, as the autumn feast, on the fifteenth (ver. 25); and suggests that the original reading, which he supposes was the fifteenth, may have been corrected subsequently in accordance with the priest, code. But if the priest-cede was posterior to and modeled after Ezekiel. Why should it have ordained the fourteenth instead of that which its master recommended, viz. the fifteenth? A sufficient explanation of the differing dates in Ezekiel is supplied if Ezekiel, in fixing them, may be held to have followed the so-called priest-cede. A feast of seven days; literally, a feast of hebdomad of days (חַג שְׁבֻעות יָמִים). By almost all interpreters this is understood to mean \"a feast of a full week, the exact duration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which began with the eating of the Paschal lamb (Exodus 12:8, 15-20; Leviticus 23:6; Numbers 9:11; Deuteronomy 16:3, 4). At the same time, it is frankly admitted that, to extract this sense from the words, שְׁבֻעות must be changed into שְׁבְעַת. As the words stand, they can only signify a feast of weeks of days. חַג שְׁבֻעות, in Exodus 34:22 and Deuteronomy 16:10, is applied to the Feast of Pentecost, which was called \"a Feast of Hebdomads,\" from the seven weeks which intervened between the Passover and it. Hence Kliefoth, adhering to the legitimate sense of the expression, understands the prophet to say that the whole period of seven weeks between the first Passover and Pentecost should be celebrated in the new dispensation as a Feast of Unleavened Bread. In support of this Kliefoth cites a similar use of the word \"days\" in Genesis 29:14; Genesis 41:1; Deuteronomy 21:13; 2 Kings 15:13; Jeremiah 28:3, 11; Daniel 10:2, 3; and certainly no objection can be taken to a Passover of seven weeks, if Ezekiel may be supposed to have been merely expressing analogically spiritual conceptions, and not furnishing actual legislation to be afterwards put in operation. Against this translation, however, Keil urges that the expression, \"seven days of the feast\" (ver. 23), appears to mark the duration of the festival; but this is not so convincing as its author imagines, since the prophet may be held as describing, in vers. 23, 24, the procedure of each seven days without intending to unsay what he had already stated, that the feast should continue seven weeks of days. A second objection pressed by Keil, that יָמִים \"is not usually connected with the preceding noun in the construct state, but is attached as an adverbial accusative,\" as in the above-cited passages, is sufficiently disposed of by Kliefoth's statement that the punctuation might easily be altered so as to read שָׁבֻעות. Upon the whole, while not free from difficulty, the view of Kliefoth seems best supported by argument.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The first day of the feast proper, i.e. the fourteenth, should be distinguished by the prince's presenting, for himself and for all the people of the land, a bullock for a sin offering. That this was a deviation from the earlier Mosaic legislation in three particulars is apparent. In, the first place, the \"sin offering\" here prescribed was manifestly to take precedence of the Paschal feast proper, whereas in the Paschal festival of the so-called priest-code the daffy sacrifices were appointed to begin on the fifteenth after the Paschal lamb had been slain and eaten (Leviticus 23:8). In the second place, the sin offering was to consist of a bullock instead of a he-goat as formerly (Numbers 28:22). In the third place, it was not intended to be renewed on each of the seven following days of the feast, but was designed, by repeating the sacrifice of the first and seventh days, to connect these with the fourteenth, on which the feast proper opened.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - The deviations of Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses in regard to the offerings to be made during the seven days of the feast are also unmistakable (see Numbers 28:19-22).NEWLINENEWLINE(1) While the Pentateuchal code demanded, as a daily burnt offering, two bullocks, one ram, and seven yearling lambs, this of Ezekiel prescribes seven bullocks and seven rams.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) While that enjoined, as a meat offering, three-tenths of an ephah of flour mixed with oil for each bullock, two-tenths for a ram, and one-tenth for each lamb, this asks an ephah of flour with a hin of oil for each bullock and each ram.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The sin offering in the new Torah should be the same as in the old, a he-goat daily.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel45:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - In the seventh month, i.e. in month of Tishri (1 Kings 8:2), in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he, i.e. the prince, as in ver. 22, do the like in the feast of the seven days; or, in the feast shall he do the like the seven days (Revised Version). That is, the same sacrifices should be offered daily throughout the seven days of this feast as had been offered during the seven days of the former feast. That this feast was designed to represent the ancient Feast of Tabernacles can scarcely be doubted, though the practice of living in booths (Leviticus 23:40-43) is not adverted to. Possibly this may have been omitted, as Keil remarks, \"because the practice of living in booths would be dropped in the time to come\" (see, however, Nehemiah 8:14-17), or, as Kliefoth observes, \"because, when Ezekiel's Torah should come into operation, the people of God would be dwelling in the eternal tabernacles of which the booths of the Mosaic Torah were but the types.\" Nor are the deviations of Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, in respect of the daily offerings prescribed for this feast, fewer or of less importance than those which have been noted in connection with the Passover. Ezekiel's Torah prescribes for a burnt offering seven bullocks and seven rams daily, for a sin offering a he-goat daily, for a meat offering an ephah of flour with a hin of oil for each bullock and each ram daily; the Mosaic Torah, while retaining the he goat for a sin offering, required - for a burnt offering on the first day thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs, and so on, diminishing by one bullock each day, till the seventh, when seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs should be sacrificed; and for a meal offering three-tenths of an ephah of flour for every bullock, and two-tenths of an ephah for every ram, and one-tenth of an ephah for each lamb, according to the number of bullocks, rams, and lambs for each day. In addition, the Mosaic celebration concluded with a solemn assembly with special sacrifices on the eighth day (see Leviticus 23:34-36; Numbers 29:12-39), of which no mention is made in Ezekiel. Nor should it be overlooked that Ezekiel's Torah omits all reference to the other great festival that figures in the Mosaic Torah, viz. that of Pentecost, or the Feast of Weeks, as well as to the Feast of Trumpets and the great Day of Atonement (see on ver. 21), although Hengstenberg is of opinion that Ezekiel, having instanced the Passover and Tabernacles, the beginning and end of the feast-cycle already known to the Jews, designed that all the feasts which lay between should be included. Be this, however, as it may, to infer from the deviations in Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, as George, Vatke, Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, Robertson Smith, Cornill, and Driver have done, that the latter had no existence in the time of Ezekiel is, as Havernick observes, not only to render Ezekiel's representations completely unintelligible, but to beg the entire question between the newer criticism and the old faith. \"How will one generally explain,\" asks Cornill ('Einleitung in das Alte Testament,' p. 64), \"that a Jerusalem priest sets up a Torah for the future, which completely ignores the priest code (?), in all points remains far behind its requirements (?), and in a groping manner lays hold of the future, instead of appropriating to himself the finished system (i.e. of the, so-called priest code, supposing it to have then existed)? Why does Ezekiel require, in the cultus (which he sets up) so much less than Numbers 28, and 29.? Where, in Ezekiel is the high priest, who for the priest code is the center of the theocracy? Where is the great Day of Atonement of Leviticus 16.?\" and so on. The answer to these interrogations is that Ezekiel did not intend to republish the Mosaic Torah, but to modify it so as to meet the requirements of the new era, or (perhaps better) to express more adequately the new conceptions of religion and worship he had been commissioned to set before his fellow-exiles; and that Ezekiel had a perfect right to deal in this way even with the Mosaic Torah, inasmuch as he distinctly claimed, in committing to writing the details of his temple- vision, to be acting under special Divine guidance (Ezekiel 43:10, 11; Ezekiel 44:5). Canon Driver ('An Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 133) admits that the argument from Ezekiel's deviations from the so-called priest-code in favor of the later origin of the latter, if \"taken by itself, would not, perhaps, be a decisive one,\" and even adds that, \"however doubtful it may be whether Ezekiel presupposes the completed priests' code, it is difficult not to conclude that he presupposes parts of it\" ibid., p. 138). But if none of it existed before Ezekiel, then a counter-question to that of Cornill may be put, \"How is it to be explained that the unknown author of the priests' code should have allowed himself to deviate so far from the arrangements which Ezekiel, a prophet acting under Jehovah's guidance, had established?\" The natural reply is that when the priests' code was composed, Ezekiel's Torah did not exist. If the newer criticism believes that Ezekiel would not have deviated so largely as he has done from the rites prescribed in the priests' code had these been in operation and invested with authority (see 'Drivel', 'An Introduction,' etc., p. 133), the newer criticism should explain how the priests' code came to deviate from the Torah of Ezekiel, which, if it was not then in actual operation, was at least invested with Divine authority. Is it not every way as logical to infer, from the deviations of the priests' code (supposing it to be post-exilic) from the Torah of Ezekiel, that the author of the priests' code could not have known of the existence of Ezekiel's Torah, and therefore that it could not then have been in existence, as vice versa that Ezekiel had no acquaintance with the priests' code, and that therefore it had not in his day been composed? The impartial reasoner, with no theory to uphold, will recognize that the two arguments run exactly purpose.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.46":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-15. - The supplementary directions contained in these verses relate to the worship of the prince and the people on the sabbaths and the new moons (vers. 1-7) and at the appointed feasts generally (vers. 5-15). Verse 1. - Like the preceding sections which introduced distinctly new enactments in Ezekiel's Torah (see Ezekiel 44:9; Ezekiel 45:9, 18), this properly opens with a Thus saith the Lord God, since it refers to the worship that should be celebrated at the gate of the inner court which looketh toward the east. Ewald, after the LXX. (ἡ πύλη ἡ ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ τῇ ἐσωτέρᾳ), changes the text so as to read the outer court gate, and understands the statement here made to be a qualification of that contained in Ezekiel 44:1-3. It is, however, the inner east gate to which the present clause alludes, and the announce-meat made concerning it is that, like the outer east gate, it should be shut on the six working days; literally, the six days of the business (comp. 1 Samuel 20:19); but that, unlike the outer east gate, it should be opened on the sabbath (literally, in the day of the sabbath) and in the day of the new moon, both of which clays had been marked under the Law, and should in future continue to be marked, by special sacrificial celebrations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The reason for the opening of this inner east gate should be that the prince might enter it as far as its threshold, and stand there worshipping by the posts of the gate, while his burnt offerings and his peace offerings were being prepared by the priests, who, rather than the prince, were the proper ministers for conducting the sacrificial ceremony. The prince should reach his station at the threshold of the inner gate, by the way of the porch of that (or, the) gate without; but whether this signified that he should pass through the eastern gate of the outer court, and so advance towards the inner east gate, as Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, and Plumptre assume, or, as Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Smend suppose, that he should enter the inner gate by the way of the porch of the gate, i.e. from the outside, from the outer court into which he had previously entered through either the north or the south outer gates, cannot be decided. In favor of the former may be urged the consideration that it seems more natural to apply מִהוּצ to the outer gate than to the outer court, since no, one could enter the inner gate except from the outer court, unless he were already in the inner court; but in favor of the latter isNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the stringent character of the language in Ezekiel 44:1-3, which expressly declares that the outer east gate should not be opened, and that no man should enter in by it, thus scarcely admitting of an exception; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the statement in vers. 9, 10 of the present chapter, that in the \"appointed feasts\" the prince and the people alike should enter the outer court either by the north or the south gate, since, if any of these \"feasts\" fell upon a sabbath, this regulation would not be practicable, if the prince and the people were required to enter by different doors. The question, however, in itself is immaterial. The points of importance are that the prince should worship in the porch of the inner gate, and that, on finishing his worship, he should retire, and that the gate should not be shut; until the evening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Likewise (or, and) to the people of the land should be accorded permission to worship at this inner gate, only not like the prince, in its porch, but at its door, yet on the same occasions as he, in the sabbaths and in the new moons. Kliefoth, who takes \"this gate\" to signify the outer gate, through which, according to his interpretation of ver. 2 (see above), the prince should pass so as to reach the inner east gate, conceives the import of the present verse to be that, while the prince should be permitted on the sabbaths and new moons to pass through the eastern gate, the people \"should remain standing in front of the outer east gate, and, looking through it and the opened inner east gate, should pray before Jehovah.\" This, however, is unnatural, even on the hypothesis that the prince should pass through the outer east gate, and the view of Keil is greatly preferable, that \"this gate\" was the inner east gate, and that the people should reach it (even if the prince did not) by entering the outer court through the north gate or the south.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5 describe the sacrifices the prince should offer unto the Lord on the sabbaths.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) A burnt offering of six lambs and a ram, all without blemish. The Mosaic Law, or so-called priests' code, demanded two yearling lambs (Numbers 28:9).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) A meat offering, consisting of an ephah of fine flour for a ram, and for the lambs as he shall be able to give; literally, a gift of his hand - not a handful, but, as ver. 7 explains, what his hand can attain unto (comp. Leviticus 14:31; Leviticus 25:26), i.e. as much as he can, with a hin of oil to an ephah, for which again the Law required two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil (Numbers 28:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7 specify the corresponding sacrifices for the new moons.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) A burnt offering of a young bullock without blemish, six lambs, and a ram, with which may be compared the two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs of the Mosaic Torah (Numbers 28:11-15).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) A meat (or, meal) offering of an ephah for the bullock, an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto (comp. ver 5; and the similar expressions in Leviticus 5:7, 11; Leviticus 12:8), with a hin of oil to an ephah. This also is less than that which had been demanded by the Law, viz. three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for each bullock, two-tenths for the ram and one-tenth for every lamb (Numbers 28:11-15). The Torah of Ezekiel omits the sin offering of a he-goat, which had a place in the Torah of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8 begins an ordinance relative to the mode of conducting worship at the appointed festivals (ver. 9; comp. Ezekiel 36:38; Ezekiel 45:17; Leviticus 23:2; Hosea 12:9), by indicating first how the prince should enter and depart from the temple. According to Kliefoth and Keil, the prince's entrance and departure should be by the way of the porch of the outer, according to Hengstenberg, Smend, and Currey, of the inner, east gate (see on ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But when the people of the land shall come before the Lord. As the preceding verse referred to the prince's entrance into and departure from the inner gate, this was intended to regulate the movements of the prince's subjects when they should enter the outer court at any of the festal seasons - not the high festivals alone, such as the Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles, which are usually denominated חַגּים, but the ordinary appointed feasts (מוְעֲדִים), including, besides the high festivals, the sabbaths and the new moons and such other religions celebrations as were or should be prescribed in the new Torah. In order to prevent confusion, and that all might be conducted with propriety (comp. 1 Corinthians 14:40), no one should depart by the gate through which he had entered, but by the opposite, i.e. he who had entered by the north gate should retire through the south gate, and vice versa. Hengstenberg thinks the reason for this regulation \"cannot be sought in the endeavor to avoid a throng,\" since \"in that case it must have been ordained that all should go in by the same gate and go out by the opposite one;\" it must, he holds, have been \"a theological one,\" viz. \"to signify that each should go out of the sanctuary another man than he came in.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in, etc. Schroder, but without reason, would restrict this regulation to the celebrations of the first and seventh days of the first month (Ezekiel 45:18, 20); Hengstenberg would confine it to the high festivals (Ezekiel 45:21, 25); Kliefoth, Keil, and commentators generally apply it to all the statutory feasts or appointed seasons and times for united sacrificial worship. The regulation seems to teach that in such observances at least the prince should stand on a level with the people, and both enter and retire by the same door as they.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11 specifies the meat (or, meal) offering which should be presented in the feasts (חַגּים), or high festivals, as the Passover and Feast of Tabernacles, and in the solemnities (מועֲדִים), or appointed feasts generally, viz. an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give (comp. vers. 5, 7), with a hin of oil to an ephah. This is the same meat offering as was appointed for the new moons (see ver. 7), but slightly different in quantity from, though the same in principle as, that stipulated for the seven days of the Passover (Ezekiel 45:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12 determines the procedure in case of the prince resolving to offer privately, on his own account, a voluntary burnt offering or peace offering; better, a free-will offering (נְדָבָה), a sacrifice prompted by the heart of the offerer, as opposed to one legally enjoined (Exodus 35:29; Leviticus 22:23), which might be either a burnt or a peace offering. In this case the east inner gate should be opened to him as on the sabbath days (see ver. 1), but, differently from what occurred on the sabbath, it should not remain open till the evening (ver. 2), but should be shut immediately the prince's offering was done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-15 supply closing instructions for the daily sacrifice. The daily burnt offering should be a lamb of the first year; literally, a son of his year; whereas the Law of Moses required a lamb twice a day (Exodus 29:38-42; Numbers 28:1-8). The daily meat (or, meal) offering to accompany this should be the sixth part of an ephah, instead of a tenth as under Moses, and the third part of a hin of oil, instead of a fourth as prescribed by the earlier legislation, to temper with - לָרֹס (from רָסַס, a word peculiar to Ezekiel), to moisten or mix with - the fine flour. These sacrifices should be offered every morning; literally, morning by morning; but not every evening as in the Mosaic Law. This difference was not accidental, but intentional, though why in the new order of things the evening sacrifice should have been omitted does not appear. Currey thinks Ezekiel did not intend to enumerate all the sacrifices of the Law, but only a few of them, and that, though not mentioned, the evening sacrifice may have been designed to be retained. The presentation of these sacrifices was not to be the special duty of the prince, but should devolve upon the community as a whole, who are now addressed as \"thou\" (vers. 13, 14) and \"they\" (ver. 15), and who should act in its fulfillment through their priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-18. - Instructions for the prince as to how he should deal with his property are summarized in three regulations, introduced by the solemn formula of \"Thus saith the Lord\" (comp. ver. 1; Ezekiel 45:9). Verse 16. - The first regulation. The prince might dispose of a portion of his royal property (see Ezekiel 45:7, 8) by presenting part of it as a gift to any of his sons. In this case what was gifted should belong to his son or sons in perpetuity, should be his or theirs as his or their possession by inheritance; it should never again revert to the prince.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The second regulation. Should the prince, however, bestow a portion of his inheritance on one of his servants, what was thus bestowed should not belong to that servant in perpetuity, but should be regarded simply as a temporary loan which should be his till the year of liberty, הֲדְּרור שְׁנַת, i.e. the year of free flowing general - comp. Exodus 30:23, מָראּדּרור, pure myrrh (Authorized Version) or flowing myrrh (Revised Version) - hence the year of release; after which it should return to the prince. Smend thinks Ezekiel could hardly have had in view the year of jubilee (Leviticus 25:10; Leviticus 27:24), else he would not have employed the term \"liberty,\" which Jeremiah (Jeremiah 34:8, 15, 17) uses to denote the freedom regained by Hebrew bondmen in the seventh year (Exodus 21:2; Deuteronomy 15:12). ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the seventh year was only a year of the release of bondmen, not of the reversion of property, and to this rather than to that Ezekiel refers.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The year of jubilee might properly be called the \"year of liberty,\" since in it both slaves were emancipated and property was liberated. AndNEWLINENEWLINE(3) Ezekiel's phraseology is not framed (nor is Jeremiah's) in imitation of either Exodus or Deuteronomy, the latter of which in particular speaks of \"the year of release\" (שְׁםנת הַשְּׂמִטָּה), but adheres closely to the style of Leviticus, which, in fact, it presupposes. שְׁנַת הַדְּרור can only signify the year of the release, i.e. the well-known year of emancipation. The last clause should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, \"As for his inheritance (generally), it shall be for his sons,\" or, as Keil translates, \"Only his inheritance it is,\" i.e. the prince's; \"as for his sons, it shall be for them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The third regulation. The prince in all cases should endow his sons (or others) out of his own, and not out of his subjects' possessions, of which they have been violently robbed. A good rule for other princes besides this, and for owners of property in generalNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-24. - The sacrificial kitchens for the priests and for the people. This passage has been transferred by Ewald to Ezekiel 42, and inserted after ver. 14; but the Exposition will show it must have originally stood where it is. Verse 19. - After (or, and) he - i.e. the measuring man, who had hitherto acted as the prophet's conductor - brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate. This was the inner north gate, from which the prophet had been conducted to the front of the house in order to receive the sacrificial Torah (Ezekiel 44:4), and to which, when this was finished, he had been seemingly led back. From this gate, then, he was taken by his guide along the entry or passage (Ezekiel 42:9), which ran towards and extended in front of the holy chambers of (or, for) the priests, which looked toward the north, and which had already been described (Ezekiel 42:1-14). Arrived at the western corner of the chambers, he perceived a place on the two sides - or, on the hinder part (Revised Version) - westward. The translation in the Authorized Version was obviously suggested by the dual form יַדְכָּתַיִם, which properly signifies \"on both sides\" but when applied to the tabernacle (Exodus 26:23) or temple (1 Kings 6:16), always describes the back part or rear. That a similar \"place\" existed on the south side is more than probable; though Smend thinks there was not a \"place\" on the south. The LXX. omits the words after \"place,\" and supplies κεχωρισμένος, \"separated.\" Keil finds in the description here given of the passage towards the holy chambers a proof that this section could not have steed originally after Ezekiel 42:14, as in that ease no such description would have been needed. Nor would the language in Ezekiel 47:1, \"and he brought me back,\" have been required or appropriate had the prophet not in the mean while changed his place, which he does to visit the holy chambers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The \"place\" was designed as a kitchen where the priests should boil the trespass and the sin offerings and bake the meat (or, meal) offering, i.e. cook the portions of the sacrifices they should eat in their official capacity (see Ezekiel 42:13). The Law of Moses (Leviticus 8:31) required the flesh to be boiled (and probably also the flour to be baked) at the tabernacle door. The last clause, that they, i.e. the priests, bear them, i.e. the offerings, not out into the utter (or, outer) court, to sanctify the people, is by most interpreters understood in the sense of Ezekiel 44:19 (which see). To this, however, Kliefoth objects that the conception of deriving ceremonial sanctity from contact with such offerings is completely strange to the Old Testament (see Haggai 2:12), and accordingly he connects the words. \"to sanctify the people,\" with the \"baking\" and \"boiling\" of the preceding clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - The prophet next observed, as his guide led him round the outer area, that in every corner of the court there was a court - literally, a court in a corner of the court, a court in a corner of the court - and hat these were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad. The word \"joined\" קְטֻרות) has been variously translated: by Gesenins (see 'Hebrews Lex.,' sub voce), as \"vaulted\" or \"roofed,\" with which Hitzig seems to agree; by the LXX., whom Bottcher and Ewald follow, μικρά, equal to contracts; by Kliefoth, \"uncovered;\" by Havernick, \"firm,\" \"strongly built;\" by Smend,\" separated;\" by Hengstenberg and Schroder, after the Talmudists (fumum exhalantia), \"smoking\" or \"made with chimneys\" (Authorized Version margin); but is probably best rendered by the Revised Version, Keil, Currey, after Gesenius ('Thesaurus,' p. 1213), \"enclosed,\" meaning muris cineta et januis elausa. According to the last clause of ver. 22, these four corners were of one measure; or, one measure was to the four cut-away places, i.e. corners, מְהֻקְצָעות being the hoph. participle of קָצַע, \"to cut off.\" This last word is omitted in the LXX. and the Vulgate, Hitzig, and Smend, the puncta extraordinaria showing that the Massorites regarded it as suspicious.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And there was a row of building round about in them; but whether טור meant a \"wall,\" \"fence,\" or \"enclosure,\" as Gesenius, Havernick, and Ewald translate, or \"row,\" \"series,\" \"a shelf of brickwork which had several separate shelves under which the cooking-hearths were placed,\" as Keil explains, the obvious intention was to describe the range of boiling places which were built along the inside walls of these corner courts, as the next verse states.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel46:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - These are the places (literally, houses) of them that boil - hence kitchens - where the ministers of the house (or, romple) - e.g. the Levites (see Ezekiel 44:11, 12) - shall boil the sacrifice of the people; i.e. the portions of the people's offerings which fall to be consumed by the priests.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.47":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2 - As the prophet could not follow the stream's course by passing through the east inner gate, which was shut on the six working days (Ezekiel 46:1), or through the east outer gate, which was always shut (Ezekiel 44:1), his conductor led him outside of the inner and outer courts by the north gates (literally, to the north (outer) gate), and brought him round by the way without unto the outer gate by the way that looketh eastward. This can only import that, on reaching the north outer gate, the prophet and his guide turned eastward and moved round to the east outer gate. The Revised Version reads, by the way of the gate that looketh toward the east; but as the east outer gate was the terminus ad quem of the prophet's walk, it is better to translate, to the gate looking eastward. When the prophet had arrived thither, he once more beheld that there ran out - literally, trickled forth (מְפַכִּים occurring here only in Scripture, and being derived from פָכַה, \"to drop down,\" or \"weep\") - waters. Obviously these were the same as Ezekiel had already observed (whence probably the omission of the article; see Ewald's 'Syntax of the Hebrew Grammar,' p. 34, Eng. transl.). On (literally, from) the right side; or, shoulder. This, again, signified the corner where the east wall of the temple and the south wall of the gate joined.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ancles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Having emerged from the corner of the east outer gate in drops, the stream, which had not swollen in its passage across the outer court and under the temple wall, speedily exhibited a miraculous increase in depth, and therefore in volume. Having advanced eastward along the course of the stream an accurately measured distance of a thousand cubits (about one-third of a mile), the prophet's guide brought, or caused him to pass, through the waters, when he found that they were to the ankles; or, were waters of the ankles, as the Chaldee, Syriac, Vulgate, Keil, Kliefoth, Ewald, and Smend translate, rather than \"water of the foot-soles,\" as Gesenius and Havernick render, meaning,\" water that hitherto had only been deep enough to wet the soles.\" The ὕδωρ ἀφέσεως, or \"water of vanishing,\" of the LXX,, is based on the idea of \"failing,\" \"ceasing,\" \"coming to an end,\" which appears to be the root-conception of (see Genesis 47:15, 16; Psalm 77:9; Isaiah 16:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - At a second and a third distance of a thousand cubits the same process was repeated when the waters were found to be first waters to the knees, and secondly waters to (or, of) the loins. The unusual expression, מַיִם בִּרְכָּים, instead מֵי, as in the similar expressions before and after, may have been chosen, Keil suggests, in order to avoid resemblance to the phrase, מֵימֵי רַגְלַיִם in Isaiah 36:12 (Keri) - not a likely explanation. Havernick describes it simply as an instance of bold emphasis. Schroder breaks it up into two clauses, thus: \"waters, to the knees they reach.\" Smend changes מַיִם into מֵי.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - After a fourth distance of a thousand cubits, the waters had risen, or, lifted themselves up (comp. Job 8:11, in which the verb is used of a plant growing up), and become waters to swim in - literally, waters of swimming (שָׂחוּ occurs only here; the noun צְפָה only in Ezekiel 32:6) - a river that could not be passed over, on account of its depth. The word נָחַל was applied either to a river that constantly flowed from a fountain, as the Amen, or to a winter torrent that springs up from rain or snow upon the mountains, and disappears in summer like the Kedron, which had seldom any water in it (see Robinson's 'Bibl. Res.,' 1:402). That Ezekiel's river broadened and deepened so suddenly, and apparently without receiving into it any tributaries, clearly pointed to miraculous action.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Then he... caused me to return to the brink of the river. The difficulty lying in the word \"return\" has given rise to a variety of conjectures. Hengstenberg supposes the prophet had made trial of the river's depth by wading in (perhaps up to the neck), and that the angel caused him to return from the stream to the bank According to Hitzig, the measuring had taken place at some distance from the stream, and the prophet, having come up to his guide from the bank after making trial of the water's depth, was Once more conducted back to the river's brink. Havernick conceives the sense to be that the prophet, having accompanied the angel to the point where the stream debouched into the Dead Sea was led back to the riverbank. All difficulty, however, vanishes if, either with Schroder we refer וַיְשִׁבֵנִי to a mental returning, as if the import were that the angel, having ascertained that the prophet had \"seen\" the river's course, now told him to direct his attention to the bank, or, with Keil and Kliefoth, translate עַל by \"along\" or \"on\" rather than \"to.\" As the prophet had been led along or on the river's bank to see the increasing breadth and depth of the water, so was he now \"caused to return\" along or on the same bank to note the abundance of the foliage with which it was adorned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Now when I had returned בְּשׁוּבֵנִי is by the best interpreters, after Gesenius ('Hebrew Grammar,' § 132. 2), regarded as an incorrect form for בְּשׁוּבִי (literally, in my returning), though Schroder adheres to the transitive sense of the verb, and translates,\" when I had turned myself,\" and Hitzig takes the suffix נִי as a genitive of possession, and renders, \"when he came back with me.\" In any case, on the return journey the prophet observed that at (or, on) the bank (or, lip) of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other. Hitzig supposes the trees had not been there when the prophet made the down journey, but sprang up when he had turned to his guide (ver. 6), and stood with his back to the river. Kliefoth's conclusion is better, that the trees had been there all the while, but that the prophet's attention had not been directed to them. The luxuriant foliage of this vision reappears in that of the Apocalyptic river (Revelation 22:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Toward the east country (הַקַּדְמונָה אֶל־הַגְּלִילָה); literally, the east circle, in this case probably \"the region about Jordan\" (Joshua 22:10, 11), above the Dead Sea, where the valley or ghor widens out into a bread basin, equivalent to כִּכַּד הַיַרְדֵּן (Genesis 13:10). The LXX. render, or τὴν Γαλιλαίαν, designing by this, however (presumably), only to Graecize the Hebrew word גְּלִילָה as they do with the term הָעַרָבָה, desert, or, plain, which they translate by τὴν Ἀραβίαν. The Arabah signified the low, sterile valley into which the Jordan runs near Jericho, in which are the Dead Sea (hence called \"the sea of the Arabah,\" Deuteronomy 3:17; Deuteronomy 4:49), and the brook Kedron, or \"river of the Arabah\" (Amos 6:14), and which extends as far south as the head of the Elanitic gulf. The whole region is described by Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:596) as one of extreme desolation - a character which belonged to it in ancient times (Josephus, 'Wars,' 3:10. 7; 4:8. 2). The part of this Arabah into which the waters flowed was situated north of the sea, clearly not the Mediterranean, but the Dead Sea, \"the sea of the Arabah,\" as above stated, and the \"eastern sea\" as afterwards named (ver. 18), into which they ultimately flowed. The clause, which being brought forth into the sea, may either be connected with the proceeding words or formed into an independent sentence. Among those who adopt the former construction a variety of renderings prevails. The LXX. reads, \"(And the water) comes to the sea (ἐπὶ τὸ ὕδωρ τῆς διεκβολῆς), to the sea of the pouring out,\" i.e. the Dead Sea, into which the river debouches. With this Havernick agrees, rendering, \"to the sea of that outflow.\" Ewald reads, \"into the sea of muddy waters,\" meaning the Dead Sea. Kimchi, \"into the sea where the waters are brought forth,\" i.e. the ocean (the Mediterranean), whoso waters go forth to encompass the world. Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, who adopt the latter construction, borrow בָאוּ from the antecedent clause, and translate, \"To the sea (come or go) the waters that have been brought forth;\" with which accords the Revised Version. The last words record the effect which should be produced by their entering into the sea. The waters shall be healed, i.e. rendered salubrious, from being hurtful (comp. Exodus 15:23, 25; 2 Kings 2:22). The translation of the LXX., ὑγιάσει τὰ ὕδατα, is inaccurate. The unwholesome character of the Dead Sea is described by Tacitus: \"Lucius immenso ambitu, specie maris sapore corruptior, gravitate odoris accolis pestifer, neque vento impellitar neque pisces ant suetas aquis volucres patitur\" ('Hist.,' 5:6). Yon Raumer (p. 61) writes, \"The sea is celled Dead, because there is in it no green plant, no water-fowl in it, no fish, no shell. If the Jordan carry fish into it, they die.\" \"According to the testimony of all antiquity and of most modern travelers,\" says Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), \"there exists within the waters of the Dead Sea no living thing, no trace, indeed, of animal or vegetable life. Our own experience goes to confirm the truth of this testimony. We perceived no sign of life within the waters.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The nature of the healing is next described as an impartation of such celebrity to the waters that everything that liveth, which moveth - better, every living creature which swarmeth (comp. Genesis 1:20, 21; Genesis 7:21) - whitherseover the rivers (literally, the two rivers) shall come, shall live. The meaning cannot be that everything which liveth and swarmeth in the sea whither the rivers come shall live, because the Dead Sea contains no fish (see above), but whithersoever the rivers come, there living and swarming creatures of every kind shall spring into existence, shall come to life and flourish. The dual form, נַחֲלַיִם, has been accounted for by Maurer, as having been selected on account of its resemblance to מַיִם; by Hävernick and Currey, as pointing to the junction of another river, the Kedron (Hävernick), the Jordan (Currey), with the temple-stream before the latter, should fall into the sea; by Kliefoth, as alluding to a division of the river waters after entering the sea; by Neumann and Schroder, as referring to the waters of the sea and the waters of the river, which should henceforth be united; and by Hengstenberg, with whom Keil and Plumptre agree, as a dual of intensification (as in Jeremiah 1:21), signifying \"double river,\" with allusion to its greatness, or the strength of its current. None of these interpretations is free from objection; though probably, in default of better, the last is best. Ewald changes the dual into נַחְלָם, a singular with a suffix, while Hitzig makes of it a plural; but neither of these devices is satisfactory. As a further evidence that the waters of the sea should be healed by the inflowing into them of the waters of the river, it is stated that the sea should thereafter contain a very great multitude of fish (literally, and the fish will be very many), of which previously it contained none. The next clauses supply the reason of this abundance of fish, because these waters (of the river) shall - or, are (Revised Version) come thither - (into the waters of the sea), for (literally, and) they, the latter, shall be (or, are) healed, and everything shall live (or, connecting this with the foregoing clause, and everything shall be healed, and live) whithersoever the river cometh - the river, namely, that proceedeth from the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As another consequence of the inflowing of this river into the Dead Sea, it is stated that the fishers (rather, fishers, without the article) should stand upon its banks, from Engedi, even unto Englaim; there shall be a place to spread forth nets. The Revised Version more correctly renders, fishers shall stand by it; from Engedi even unto Eneglaim, shall be a place for the spreading of nets; or, more literally, a place of spreading, out for nets (comp. Ezekiel 26:5). Engedi, עֵין גֶּדִי, meaning \"Fountain of the kid;\" originally styled Hazezon-Tamar (2 Chronicles 20:2), now called 'Ain Jidy (Robinson,' Bibl. Res.,' 2:214), was situated in the middle of the west coast of the Dead Sea, and not at its southern extremity, as Jerome supposed. Englaim, עֵין עֶגְלַיִם, signifying \"Fountain of two calves,\" was located by Jerome, who cars it En Gallim, at the northern extremity of the Dead Sea, and is usually identified with the modern 'Ain Feshkhah, or \"Fountain of mist,\" at the northern end of the west coast, where the ruins of houses and a small tower have been discovered (Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:220). Ewald cites Isaiah 15:8 to show that Englaim was on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, which, Smend notes, was given up by the prophet to the sons of the East.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The miry places thereof (בִּצּלֺאתָו an incorrect reading for בִּצּותַיו, the plural with suffix of בִּצָּה, \"a marsh, or swamp,\" as in Job 8:11; Job 40:21) and the marshes thereof גְבָיָאו, \"its pools and sloughs\" (comp. Isaiah 30:14, where the term-signifies a reservoir for water, or cistern), were the low tracts of land upon the borders of the Dead Sea, which in the rainy season, when its waters overflowed, became covered with pools (see Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:225). These, according to the prophet, should not be healed (better than, \"and that which shall not be healed,\" as in the margin of the Authorized Text), obviously because the waters of the temple-river should not reach them, but should be given to salt. When the waters of the above-mentioned pools have been dried up or evaporated, they leave behind them a deposit of salt (see Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), and Canon Driver ('Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 276), following Smend, conceives that the above-named miry places and marshes in the vicinity of the Dead Sea were to be allowed to remain as they were on account of the excellent salt which they furnished. (On the supposed (!) excellence of the salt derived from the Dead Sea, Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 616, may be consulted.) If this, however, were the correct import of the prophet's words, then the clause would describe an additional blessing to be enjoyed by the land, viz. that the temple-river would not be permitted to spoil its \"salt-pans;\" but the manifest intention of the prophet was to indicate a limitation to the life-giving influence of the river, and to signify that places and persons unvisited by its healing stream would be abandoned to incurable destruction. \"To give to salt\" is in Scripture never expressive of blessing, but always of judgment (see Deuteronomy 29:23; Judges 9:47; Psalm 107:34; Jeremiah 17:6; Zephaniah 2:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The effect of the river upon the vegetation growing on its banks is the last feature added to the prophet's picture. Already referred to in ver. 7, it is here developed at greater length. The \"very many trees\" of that verse become in this all trees, or every tree for meat, i.e. every sort of tree with edible fruit (comp. Leviticus 19:23), whose leaf should not fade or wither, and whose fruit should not be consumed or finished, i.e. should not fail, but continue to bring forth new fruit, i.e., early or firstfruits (Revised Version margin), according to his (or, its) months; or, every month; the לְ in לָךחדָשִׁים being taken distributively, as in Isaiah 47:13 (compare לַיום, \"every day,\" in Ezekiel 46:13). This remarkable productivity, the prophet saw, was due, not so much to the fact that the tree roots sucked up moisture from the stream, as to the circumstance that the waters which they drank up issued out of the sanctuary. To the same circumstance were owing the nutritive and medicinal properties of their fruit and leaves respectively. The picture in this verse is unmistakably based on Genesis 2:9, and is as clearly reproduced by the Apocalyptic seer in Revelation 22:2. On this whole vision the remarks of Thomson, in 'The Land and the Book' (pp. 660-663), are worthy of being consulted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-23. - The boundaries of the land, and the manner of its division. Verse 13. - Thus saith the Lord. The usual formula introducing a new Divine enactment (comp. Ezekiel 43:18; Ezekiel 44:9; Ezekiel 45:9, 18; Ezekiel 46:1, 16). This. גֵה is obviously a copyist's error for זֶה, which the LXX., the Vulgate, and the Targum have substituted for it; the change seems demanded by the complete untranslatability of גֵה, and by the fact that וְזֶה גְּבוּל recurs in ver. 15. The border, whereby ye shall inherit the land; or, divide the land for inheritance (Revised Version). The term גְּבוּל, applied in Ezekiel 43:13, 17 to the border of the altar here signifies the boundary or limit of the land. (For the verb, comp. Numbers 32:18; Numbers 34:13; Isaiah 14:2.) According to the twelve tribes. This presupposed that at least representatives of the twelve tribes would return from exile; but it is doubtful if this can be proved from Scripture to have taken place, which once more shows that a literal interpretation of this temple-vision cannot be consistently carried through. Smend observes that the word commonly employed in the priest-cede to denote \"tribes\" is מַטּות (Numbers 26:55; Numbers 30:1; Numbers 31:4; Numbers 33:54; Joshua 14:1; Joshua 21:1; Joshua 22:14), which is never used by Ezekiel, who habitually selects, as here, the term שְׁבָטִים (Ezekiel 37:19; Ezekiel 45:8; Ezekiel 48:1), which also was not unknown to the priest-cede (Exodus 39:14; Numbers 18:2; Joshua 13:29; Joshua 21:16; Joshua 22:9, 10, 11, 13). That is to say, if the priest-cede existed before Ezekiel, he had the choice of both terms, and selected shebhet; whereas if Ezekiel existed before the priest-cede, and prepared the way for it, the author of the latter rejected Ezekiel's word shebhet, and adopted another perfectly unknown to the prophet. This fact appears to point to a dependence of Ezekiel on the priest-cede rather than of the priest-cede on Ezekiel. Joseph shall have two portions; rather, Joseph portions, as חֲבָלִים is not dual. Yet that two were intended is undoubted (see Genesis 48:22; Joshua 17:14, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Ye shall inherit it, one as well as another; literally, a man as his brother - the customary Hebrew phrase for \"equally\" (see, however, 2 Samuel 11:25). The equal participants were to be tribes, not the families, as in the Mosaic distribution (Numbers 33:54). Had the earlier principle of allotment been indicated as that to be followed in the future, it would not have been possible to give the tribes equal portions, as some tribes would certainly have a larger number of families than others. Nevertheless, the division was to be equal among the tribes, which shows it was rather of an ideal than of an actual distribution the prophet was speaking. Then what they should divide amongst themselves was to be the land concerning which Jehovah had lifted up his hand - a peculiarly Ezekelian phrase (see Ezekiel 20:5, 6, 15, 23, 28, 42), signifying \"to swear\" (comp. Genesis 14:22; Deuteronomy 33:40) - to give it unto their fathers (see Genesis 12:7; Genesis 18:8; Genesis 26:3; Genesis 28:13). That the land was not divided after this fashion among the tribes that returned from exile is one more attestation that the prophet's directions were not intended to be literally carried out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The north boundary. And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side. The Revised Version follows Kliefoth and Keil in detaching the last clause from the preceding words, and reading. This shall be the border of the land: on the north side. From the great sea, the Mediterranean, by the way of Hethlon, as men go to (or, unto the entering in of) Zedad. The former of these places (Chethlon), which is again mentioned in Ezekiel 48:1, has not yet been identified, though Currey suggests for the \"way,\" \"the defile between the ranges of Lebanus and Antilibanus, from the sea to Hamath.\" The latter (Zedad) Wetstein and Robinson find in the city of Sadad (Sudud), east of the road leading from Damascus to Humo (Emesa), and therefore west of Hamath; but as Hamath in all probability lay to the east of Zedad, this opinion must be rejected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The four names here mentioned belong to towns or places lying on the road to Zedad, and stretching from west to east. Hamath, called also Hamath the Great (Amos 6:2), situated on the Orontes, north of Hermon and Antilibanus (Joshua 13:5; Judges 3:3), was the capital of a kingdom to which also belonged Riblah (2 Kings 23:33). Originally colonized by the Canaanites (Genesis 10:18), it became in David's time a flourishing kingdom under Toi, who formed an alliance with the Hebrew sore-reign against Hadadezer of Zoba (2 Samuel 8:9; 1 Chronicles 18:9). It was subsequently conquered by the King of Assyria (2 Kings 18:34). Winer thinks it never belonged to Israel; but Schurer cites 1 Kings 9:19 and 2 Chronicles 8:3, 4 to show that at least in Solomon's reign it was temporarily annexed to the empire of David's son. In Ezekiel's chart the territory of united Israel should extend, not to the town of Hamath, but to the southern boundary of the land of Hamath. Berothah was probably the same as Berothai (2 Samuel 8:8), afterwards called Chun (1 Chronicles 18:8), if Chun is not a textual corruption. The town in question cannot be identified either with the modern Beirut on the Phoenician coast (Conder), since it must have lain west of Hamath, and therefore at a considerable distance from the sea; or with Birtha, the present day El-Bir, or Birah, on the east bank of the Euphrates, which is too far east; or with the Galilaean Berotha, near Kadesh (Josephus), as this is too far south; but must be sought for between Hamath and Damascus, and most likely close to the former. Sibraim, occurring here only, may, on the other hand, be assumed to have lain nearer Damascus, and may, perhaps, be identified with Ziphron (Numbers 34:9), though the site of this town cannot be where Wetstein placed it, at Zifran, north-east of Damascus, and on the road to Palmyra. Smend compares it with Sepharvaim (2 Kings 17:24). Damascus was the well-known capital of Syria (Isaiah 7:8), and the principal emporium of commerce between East and West Asia (Ezekiel 27:18). Its high antiquity is testified by both Scripture (Genesis 14:15; Genesis 15:2) and the cuneiform inscriptions, in which it appears as Dimaski and Dimaska (Schrader, ' Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament,' p. 138). Hazar-hatticon; or, the middle Hazar, was probably so styled to distinguish it from Hazar-enan (ver. 17). (On the import of Hatticon, see Exodus 26:28 and 2 Kings 20:4, in both of which places it signifies \"the middle.\") The word Hazar (חֲצַר), \"an enclosure,\" or \"place fenced off,\" was employed to denote villages or townships, of which at least six are mentioned in Scripture (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' sub voce). Hauran, Αὐρανῖτις (LXX.), \"Cave-land,\" so called because of the number of its caverns, was most likely designed to designate \"the whole tract of land between Damascus and the country of Gilead\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The northern boundary is further defined as extending from the sea, i.e. the Mediterranean on the west, to Hazar-enan, or the \"Village of fountains,\" in the east, which village again is declared to have been the border, frontier city (Keil), at the border (Revised Version) of Damascus, and as having on the north northward the border or territory of Hamath. The final clause adds, And this is the north side, either understanding וְאֵת, with Gesenius, as equivalent to αὐτός, ipse, \"this same,\" or with Hitzig and Smend, after the Syriac, substituting for it here and in vers. 18, 19 ולֺאת as in ver. 20; though Hengstenberg and Keil prefer to regard אֵת as the customary sign of the accusative, and to supply some such thought as \"ye see\" (Hengstenberg), or \"ye shall measure\" (Keil), which ver. 18 shows was in the prophet's mind. Compared with the ancient north boundary of Canaan (Numbers 34:7-9), this appointed by Ezekiel's Torah for the new land shows a marked correspondence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The east boundary. And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, etc. The Revised Version, after Keil and Kliefoth, translates, And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, shall be (the) Jordan; from the (north) border unto the east sea shall ye measure. Smend offers as the correct rendering, The east side goes from between Hauran and Damascus, and from between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. In any case, by this instruction, first the land of Israel was defined as the territory lying west of the Jordan, and secondly its boundary should extend from the last-named north border at its easternmost point, Hazar-enan, down the Jordan valley to the Dead Sea. The practical effect of this would be to cut off the lands which in the earlier division (Numbers 34:14, 15) had been assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Otherwise the boundary here given corresponds with that traced in Numbers, though the latter is more minute. Hengstenberg, however, thinks the prophet cannot have intended to assert that the new Israel should not possess the land of Gilead as a frontier in the future as formerly, as in that case he would have been at variance, not only with preexisting Scripture (comp. Psalm 60:7; Micah 7:14; Jeremiah 1:19; Zechariah 10:10), but with subsequent history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The south boundary. This should begin where the east boundary terminated, viz. at Tamar, \"Palm tree.\" Different from Hazezon-Tamar, or Engedi (ver. 10; 2 Chronicles 20:2), which lay too far up the west side of the sea, Tamar can hardly be identified either with the Tamar of 1 Kings 9:18 near Tadmor in the wilderness, or with the Thamara (Θαμαρά) of Eusebius between Hebron and Elath, supposed by Robinson ('Bibl. Rea,' it 616, 622) to he Kurnub, six hours south of Milh, towards the pass of Es-Sufah, since this was too distant from the Dead Sea The most plausible conjecture is that Tamar was \"a village near the southern end of the Dead Sea\" (Currey). Proceeding westward, the southern boundary should reach to the waters of strife in Kadesh; better, to the waters of Meribotk Kadesh. These were in the Desert of Sin, near Kadesh-Barnea (Numbers 20:1-13), which, again, was on the road from Hebron to Egypt (Genesis 16:14). The exact site, however, of Kadesh-Barnea is matter of dispute; Rowland and Keil find it in the spring 'Ain Kades, at the north-west corner of the mountain-land of Azazimeh, which stretches on the south of Palestine from the south-south-west to the north-north-east, and forms the watershed Between the Mediterranean and the Arabah valley. Delitzsch and Conder seek it in the neighborhood of the Wady-el-Jemen, on the south-east side of the above watershed, and on the road from Mount Hot. Robinson ('Bibl. Rea,' 2:582) discovers it in 'Ain-el-Weibeh, not far from Petra. A writer (Sin., Smend?) in Riehm ('Handworterbuch des Biblischen Alterthums,' art. \"Kades\") pleads for a site on the west side of the Azazimeh plateau, and in the vicinity of the road by Shur to Egypt. Leaving Kadesh, the boundary should continue to the river, or, brook, of Egypt, and thence extend to the great sea, or Mediterranean. The punctuation of גַחֲלָה, which makes the word signify \"lot,' must be changed into נַחְלָה, so as to mean \"river,\" since the reference manifestly is to the torrent of Egypt, the Wady-el-Arish, on the borders of Palestine and Egypt, which enters the Mediterranean near Rhinocorura (Ῥινοκόρουρα). In Numbers 34:5 it is called the river of Egypt. And this is the south side southward (see on ver. 17). The correspondence between this line and that of the earlier chart (Numbers 34:4, 5) is once more apparent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath.

This, as in Numbers 34:6, should be the great sea from the border, i.e. the southern boundary last mentioned (ver. 19), till a man come over against Hamath; literally, unto (the place which is) over against the coming to Hamath; i.e. till opposite the point (on the coast) at which one enters the territory of Hamath (comp. Judges 19:10; Judges 20:43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-23. - The geographical boundaries of the land having been indicated, general directions are furnished as to the manner of its distribution.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) It should be partitioned among the tribes as tribes rather than among the families of Israel (see on ver. 13).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The division of the territory should be made by lot. This is pointed to by the use of חָלַק (from חֵלֶק, \"a smooth stone\"), which signifies \"to divide by lot.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The strangers who should sojourn amongst the tribes and beget children amongst them should inherit equally with Israelites who should be born in the country.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The inheritance of the stranger should be assigned him in the tribe where he sojourned. Of these regulations the last two were an advance on the earlier Mosaic legislation with regard to \"strangers,\" or גֵּרִים, who were to be treated with affectionate kindness (Exodus 22:21; Exodus 23:9; Leviticus 19:34; Deuteronomy 1:16; Deuteronomy 24:14), admitted to offer sacrifice (Leviticus 17:8, 10, 13), and even allowed to partake of the Passover on submitting to circumcision (Exodus 12:48), but on no account permitted to hold property in land (Leviticus 25:47-55). But if the priest-code was later than Ezekiel, why should it have receded from the freer and more liberal spirit of Ezekiel? If progressive development can determine the relative ages of two documents, then Ezekiel, which accords equal rights to Jew and Gentile in the new Israel, and thus anticipates that breaking down of the middle wall of partition which has taken place under the gospel (John 10:16; Romans 2:10, 11; Romans 9:24; Galatians 3:8-14, 28; Ephesians 2:14-16), should be posterior to the priest-code, which shows itself to be not yet emancipated from the trammels of Jewish exclusivism. At the same time, Ezekiel's Torah does not grant equal rights with native-born Israelites to \"strangers\" indiscriminately, or only to those of them who should have families, as Hitzig suggests, in reward for their increasing the population, but to such of them as should permanently settle in the midst of Israel, and show this by begetting children, and in this manner \"building houses\" for themselves. Kliefoth justly cautions against concluding from the prophet's statement that the time in which the prophet's vision realizes itself will necessarily be one in which marrying and begetting children will take place; and with equal justice points out that the number of Israel, especially when swelled up by an influx of Gentiles, will be so great (comp. ver. 10) as to render their settlement within the narrow boundaries of the land an impossibility - in this circumstance finding another indication that the prophet's language was intended to be symbolically, not literally, interpreted. NOTE. - On the boundaries of the land. Smend thinksNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that in respect of the north boundary, Ezekiel and the priest-code contradict the older source of the Pentateuch, which does not permit the territory of Asher to extend so far north as Hamath (see Joshua 19:24-31; and comp. Judges 1:31);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that never at any time did Israelites dwell so far north as at the entering in of Hamath;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that this extension of the land northwards was intended as a compensation for the withdrawment of the territory east of the Jordan; andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) that in dividing among tribes rather than among families Ezekiel deviates from both the Jehovistic tradition and the priest-code. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) if the above-cited passages do not extend Asher's territory beyond Tyre, Genesis 15:18, which critics assign to the Elohist, one of the authors of J.E., the so-called prophetical narrative of the Hexateuch, and Exodus 23:31, which, according to the same authorities, formed part of the commonly styled book of the covenant, expressly mention the great river Euphrates as the north boundary of the land, while the same is recognized by the Deuteronomist (Deuteronomy 11:24; 19:8).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) 1 Kings 4:24; 1 Kings 8:65; and 2 Kings 14:25 (comp. 2 Chronicles 7:8; 2 Chronicles 8:3, 4) show that in the time of Solomon the boundaries of the land reached as far north as Hamath.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) As it was not originally contemplated by the Mosaic distribution to take immediate possession of the east Jordan land (Numbers 34:10-12), and this was only granted to Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh on their entreaty (Numbers 32:33-42), no ground existed why its withdrawal should be compensated for.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) If Ezekiers division of the land according to tribes rather than families shows that it existed prior to the priest-code, then the same argument should demonstrate its prior existence to J.E., which throughout as-stones the principle of division according to families.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) If Ezekiel preceded the priest-code, it will require some explanation to understand, first, why the author of the latter should have followed the comparatively uncertain Jehovistic tradition rather than the definite arrangements made by a prophet whom he regarded as practically the originator of his faith; and secondly, why he should have so materially altered that prophet's land-boundaries and tribe-dispositions.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel47:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Ezek.48":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the names of the tribes.

Verses 1-7. - The portions north of the terumah. These should be seven, lie in parallel strips from the Mediterranean to the east border, and be allocated to the tribes of Dan, Asher, Naphtali, Manasseh, Ephraim, Reuben, and. Judah. The divergences between this and the earlier division under Joshua (14-19.) are apparent.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) In that Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh received portions on the east of Jordan; in this no tribe obtains a lot outside of the boundary of the Holy Land.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) In that the allocation commenced in the south with Judah; in this it begins in the north with Dan (for the reason, see Exposition).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) In that the most northern portions, those of Asher and Naphtali, started from a point a little above Tyre; in this the most northern portion, that of Dan, proceeds from the entering in or the south border of Hamath, some fifty or sixty miles north of Damascus.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) In that the portions were scarcely ever parallel; in this they always are.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) In that the portions of Judah and Reuben lay south, and that of Dan west of Jerusalem; in this all three are situated north of the city.

The tribe of Levi Being excepted, the number twelve should in the future as in the past division of the holy soil be preserved by assigning to Joseph portions (Ezekiel 47:13), one for Ephraim and one for Manasseh. From the north end. On the former occasion the allotment had begun in the south of the land and proceeded northwards; on this it should commence in the north and move regularly southward. The alteration is sufficiently explained by remembering that, after the conquest, the people were viewed as having come from the south, whereas at the restoration they should appear as entering in from the north. To the coast of (better, beside) the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to (literally, to the entering in of) Hamath, Hazar-enan, the border of Damascus. This was the north boundary of the land from west to east, as already defined (Ezekiel 47:16, 17); and with this line the portion of Dan should begin. The portion should then, as to situation, be one lying northwards, to the coast of (or rather, beside) Hamath. That is to say, beginning with the border of Hamath, it should extend southwards. For these are his sides, east and west should be, And there shall be to him sides east, west, meaning \"the tract between both eastern and western boundaries,\" rather than as Hitzig translates, \"And there shall be to him the east side of the sea,\" signifying that his territory should embrace the land east of the Mediterranean;\" or as Hengstenberg renders, And they shall be to him the east side the sea,\" equal to \"the tract in question should have the sea for its east border.\" Then, as this applies equally to all the tribe-portions, Hengstenberg regards \"to him\" (לו) as pointing to \"the whole of the tribes combined into an ideal unity,\" but expositors generally agree that \"to him\" should be referred to Dan, whom the prophet had in mind and was about to mention. A portion for Dan should be Dan one \"portion,\" חֶבֶל (Ezekiel 47:13), rather than \"tribe,\" שֵׁבֶט, as Smend proposes. To take אֶחָד as alluding to the enumeration of the tribes is indeed countenanced by Ezekiel's mode of numbering the gates (vers. 30-35); but Ezekiel's style in vers. 30-35 will be preserved here also if חֶבֶל precede \"Judah,\" thus: \"the portion of Danone.\" \"The presupposition that one tribe should receive exactly as much as another led to the individual tribe's portion being considered as a monas\" (Kliefoth).

Ezekiel 44:30). The changes in the text made by the LXX. and favored by Hitzig and Smend - \"to the Levites\" instead of \"the Levites\" (ver. 13), and \"twenty\" instead of \"ten thousand\" (ver. 13) - are unnecessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-19. - In the same way the portion for the city receives detailed exposition.

Leviticus 10:10) and designed for the city, i.e. for dwelling, and for suburbs, i.e. for the erection of houses, and for an open space or precinct (מִגְרָשׁ) around the city, similar to that around the sanctuary (see Ezekiel 45:2). Among the Romans \"a space of ground was left free from buildings, both within and without the walls, which was called pomaerium, and was likewise held sacred\" (see Adam's 'Roman Antiquities,' p. 62).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The city should stand in the midst thereof, as the sanctuary in the midst of the priests' portion (ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The dimensions of the city should be four thousand five hundred reeds on the four sides; in other words, it should form a square (comp.

By \"them that serve the city\" Hitzig and Smend understand its ordinary inhabitants, since a district may be said to be cultivated through simple residence upon it (compare colere locum). Havernick, after Gesenius, thinks of the workmen who should be employed in building the city, against which may be urged that the city is supposed to be already built. Hengstenberg, with whom Plumptre seems disposed to agree, can only see in the city servers \"a militia who take the city in the midst.\" Keil and Kliefoth find them in the laboring classes, who should not in this future state, as so often in ordinary states among men, be destitute of a possession in land, but should receive an allotment for their maintenance. But an obvious objection to this view is that it hands over the city land exclusively to the laboring classes, forgetting that the \"other\" classes require support as well as they. Probably the best interpretation is to regard עֹבְדֵי הָעִיר, \"them that serve the city,\" as standing in antithesis to the other two classes already mentioned - the Levites, whose office should be to serve the tabernacle (see Numbers 4:24, 26; Numbers 18:6, in which עָבַד is employed to denote the service of the Levites); and the priests, whose special function should be to serve the altar (see Numbers 18:7, in which, again, the same verb is used). Thus regarded, \"they that serve the city\" will mean all engaged in secular pursuits in the city, which approximates to the view of Hitzig; and the prophet's language will signify that all such should derive their sustenance from the city lands, i.e. should either have direct access to these lands to cultivate them for themselves, or should obtain a share in the produce of these lands for other services rendered to the city. With this accords the further statement that those who served the city should serve it out of all the tribes of Israel; i.e. its inhabitants should not, as formerly, be drawn chiefly from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, but contain representatives from all the tribes of Israel (comp. Ezekiel 45:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare, with the possession of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - All the oblation, the whole terumah, must in this verse include the three portions already marked out for the priests, the Levites, and the city. Added together, they should form a square of five and twenty thousand reeds. Hence it is added in the second clause, Ye shall offer the holy oblation four square, with the possession of the city. Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Keil translate, \"To a fourth part shall ye lift off the holy terumah for a possession of the city,\" as if the sense were that the area of the city possession should be a fourth part of the area of the whole tern-mall. That 5000 of breadth is a fourth part of 20,000 of breadth may be admitted; but that the city portion was not in area a fourth of the other two, a little arithmetic will show - the area of the whole terumah being 25,000 × 25,000 reeds = 625,000,000 square reeds, and that of the city possession being 5000 × 25,000 reeds = 125,000,000 square reeds. Hence the Authorized and Revised Versions are probably correct in taking רְבִיעִית, \"a fourth part (see Exodus 29:40), as equivalent to רָבוּעַ (Ezekiel 43:16), τετράγωνον (LXX.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - The prince's portion should take up the residue of the original oblation, or terumah (see ver. 8), from which had been withdrawn the aforesaid square containing the portions of the Levites, the priests, and the city. This residue should consist of two strips of land, situated one on each side of the holy oblation (here, of the priests and Levites) and of the possession of the city, and running along the whole length of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation (here the three portions composing the square), and extending eastward to the Jordan and westward to the Mediterranean. The last two clauses of ver. 21, which should read, And the holy oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it, implies that the two parts of the prince's portion, the eastern and the western, should be equal. Ver. 22 teaches that the whole intermediate territory between the border of Judah (in the north of the terumah) and the border of Benjamin (in the south of the terumah), from the possession of the Levites (the north portion of the terumah) and from (equivalent to \"to\") the possession of the city (the southern portion of the terumah), should belong to the prince. The mention of the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city as the extreme portions of the terumah, appears to indicate that the priests' portion lay between. Ewald translates as if the prophet meant to say the sanctuary should lie between the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city (in the first place), and between the two parts of the prince's land (in the second place), and yet again between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin (in the third place): but to read thus the text must be changed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be for the prince.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-29. - As for the rest of the tribes, these should follow on the south of the city portion, in parallel tracts, from east to west - Benjamin: Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Gad - till the southern boundary of the land should be reached, which boundary is again defined as in Ezekiel 47:19. Each tribe should receive, as those north of the terumah, one portion. The exact extent of this equal portion, though not stated, may be calculated - Latitude of entrance to Hamath 34° 20' Latitude of Kadesh (say) 30° 30' 3° 50' 60 × 3 5/6 - 230 geographical miles. But the whole breadth of the terumah was 25,000 reeds = 37 geographical miles. Hence 230 - 37 - 193 miles, which, divided by 12, gives 16 miles of breadth (from north to south) for each portion. The precise length from east to west is more difficult to estimate, in consequence of the varying widths of the land. Accepting this, however, as 55 miles at Jerusalem, the breadth of the prince's portion from east to west would be only 2½ miles on each side of the terumah; which, multiplied by 50 miles from north to south, would yield an area of 125 square miles on each side, or of 250 square miles in all. The disposition of the southern tribes differs from that made under the earlier division of the land - Simeon alone lying where he had been formerly placed, in the south quarter, Issachar and Zebulun being fetched from the north, Benjamin from the middle, and Gad from the west to keep him company. Upon the whole, the new arrangement has several marked peculiarities which distinguish it from the old. While agreeing with the old in this, that the three tribes, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali retain their original places in the north, and the temple is not deprived of its central position between Judah and Benjamin, it differs from the old in placing the three northern tribes side by side from west to east, but after one another from north to south, and exchanges the positions of Benjamin and Judah, transferring the former to the south and the latter to the north of the temple and the city. Then, while under the old neither priests, Levites, nor prince had a portion, all three obtain one in this. And, finally, while under the old no regard was had to the temple, in the new this forms the central point of the whole.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon shall have a portion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, Issachar a portion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a portion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-35. - The closing paragraph is devoted to a statement of the gates, dimensions, and name of the city. Verse 30. - The goings out of the city. These were not, as Hitzig, Gesenius, Ewald, Schroder, and Currey have supposed, the city exits, or gates, which are afterwards referred to, but, as Kliefoth, Keil, Hengstenberg, and Smend suggest, the extensions or boundary-lines of the city, in other words, the city walls in which the gates should be placed, and which are measured before the gates are specified. The north wall, with which the rest should correspond, should be four thousand and five hundred measures; literally, five hundred and four thousand (not cubits, as Ewald states, but reeds) by measure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel48:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-34. - The gates of the city. These should be twelve in number, three on each side, and named after the twelve tribes (comp. Revelation 21:12). The gates leading northward should be those of Reuben, Judah, and Levi, all children of Leah (Genesis 29:32, 35), as Keil observes, \"the firstborn in age, the firstborn by virtue of the patriarchal blessing, and the one chosen by Jehovah for his own service in the place of the firstborn.\" The same three occupy the first three places and in the same order in the blessing of Moses (Deuteronomy 33:6-8). Towards the east should lead the gates of Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan, the first and second sons of Rachel, and the third a son of Rachel's handmaid (Genesis 30:6, 24; Genesis 35:18). In the blessing of Moses Benjamin precedes Joseph (Deuteronomy 33:12, 13). The south gates receive the names of Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun, again all sons of Leah. The west gates are those of Gad, Asher, and Naphtali, that is, two sons of Leah's handmaid and one of Rachel's. It is observable that in the naming of the gates Levi resumes his place among the tribes, which necessitates the substitution of Joseph the original tribe-father instead of Ephraim and Manasseh his two sons.

Four years before it came - we are now between the fourth month of the fifth year (Ezekiel 1:2) and the sixth month of the sixth year (Ezekiel 8:1) of Zedekiah. and the siege began in the ninth year (2 Kings 25:1) - Ezekiel, on the segnius irritant principle, brought it, as here narrated, before the eyes of the exiles. That he did so implies a certain artistic culture, in possessing which he stands alone, so far as we know, among the prophets of Israel, and to which his residence in the land of the Chaldees may have contributed.

Nat.,' 7:57), and the like, which were, in fact, the books of that place and time, and of which whole libraries have been brought to light in recent excavations (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' ch. 22) and engraves upon it the outlines of \"a city\" (Revised Version), in which the exiles would at once recognize the city of their fathers, the towers which they had once counted (Isaiah 33:18; Psalm 48:12), the temple which had been their glory and their joy. Bricks with such scenes on them were found among the ruins of Nimroud, now in the British Museum (Layard, ut supra, ch. 7, p. 167). It is not difficult to picture to ourselves the wondering curiosity with which Ezekiel's neighbours would watch the strange proceeding. In this case the sign would be more impressive than any spoken utterance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Lay siege against it, etc. The wonder would increase as the spectators looked on what followed. Either tracing the scene on the tablet, or, more probably, as ver. 3 seems to indicate, constructing a model of the scene, the prophet brings before their eyes all the familiar details of a siege, such as we see on numerous Assyrian bas-reliefs: such also as the narratives of the Old Testament bring before us. There areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the forts (as in 2 Kings 25:1; Jeremiah 52:4; Ezekiel 17:17; Ezekiel 21:22; Ezekiel 26:8), or, perhaps, the wall of circumvallation, which the besiegers erected that they might carry on their operations in safety;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) then the mount, or mound (the English of the Authorized Version does not distinguish between the two) of earth from which they plied the bows or catapults (Jeremiah 6:6; Jeremiah 32:24; Jeremiah 33:4; Ezekiel, ut supra);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the camps (plural in the Hebrew and Revised Version), or encampments, in which they were stationed in various positions found the city;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the battering rams. Here the history both of the word and the thing has a special interest. The primary meaning of the Hebrew word is \"lamb\" (so in Deuteronomy 32:14; 1 Samuel 15:9, et al., Revised Version), or, better, \"full grown wethers or rams\" (Furst). Like the Greek κρίος (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:4. 1; 2 Macc. 12:15), and the Latin aries (Livy, 21:12; 31:32, et al.), it was transferred to the engine which was used to \"butt,\" like a ram, against the walls of a besieged city, and which, in Roman warfare, commonly terminated in a ram's head in bronze or iron. Ezekiel is the only Old Testament writer who, here and in Ezekiel 21:22, uses the word, for which the LXX. gives βελοστάσεις, and the Vulgate arietes. The margin of the Authorized Version in both places gives \"chief leaders,\" taking \"rams\" in another figurative sense; but, in the face of the LXX. and Vulgate, there is no reason for accepting this. Battering rams frequently appear in Assyrian bas-reliefs of a much earlier date than Ezekiel's time, at Nimroud (Vaux, 'Nineveh and Persepolis,' p. 456), Konyunyik (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 14:0, and elsewhere. They were hung by chains near the bottom of the besiegers' towers, and were propelled against the walls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - An iron pan. The word is used in Leviticus 2:5; Leviticus 6:21, et al., for a flat or shallow vessel in which cakes were baked or fried. Such a pan, like the Scotch \"girdle,\" or our \"gridiron,\" may well have formed part of the furniture of the prophet's house when it was taken for this strange use. It was to represent the kind of shield or fence set up on the ground, from behind which the besiegers discharged their arrows. Such shields are seen, like the battering rams, in Assyrian bas-reliefs (Layard, 'Nineveh,' etc., 2:345). Other interpretations, which see in it the symbol of the circumvallation of the city, or of the impenetrable barrier which the sins of the people had set up between themselves and Jehovah, or of the prophet himself as strong and unyielding (Jeremiah 1:18), do not commend themselves. The flat plate did not go round the city, and the spiritual meaning is out of harmony with the context. This shall be a sign, etc. (comp. like forms in Ezekiel 12:6, 11; Ezekiel 24:25, 27). The exiles of Tel-Abib, who wore the only spectators of the prophet's acts, are taken as representatives of \"the house of Israel,\" that phrase being commonly used by Ezekiel, unless, as in vers. 5, 6, and Ezekiel 37:16, there is a special reason for noting a distinction for Jonah as representing the whole nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Lie thou also upon thy left side, etc. We find the explanation of the attitude in Ezekiel 16:46. Samaria was on the \"left hand,\" i.e. to the north, as a man looked to the east. So the same word yamin is both \"the south\" (1 Samuel 23:19, 24; Psalm 84:12) and \"the right hand.\" Here, accordingly, the \"house of Israel\" is taken in its specific sense, as the northern kingdom as distinguished from the \"house of Judah\" in ver. 6. Thou shalt bear their iniquity; ie., as in all similar passages (Exodus 28:43; Leviticus 5:17; Leviticus 7:18; Numbers 18:1, et al.), the punishment of their iniquity. The words so taken will help us to understand the numerical symbolism of the words that followed. The prophet was by this act to identify himself with both divisions of the nation, by representing in this strange form at once the severity and the limits of their punishment. I adopt, without any hesitation, the view that we have here the record of a fact, and not of a vision narrated. The object of the act was to startle men and make them wonder. As week after week went on this, exceptis excipiendis, was to be Ezekiel's permanent attitude, as of one crushed to the very ground, prostrate under the burden thus laid upon him, as impersonating his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Three hundred and ninety days, etc. The days, as stated in ver. 6, stand for years according to the symbolism (with which Ezekiel was probably acquainted) of Numbers 14:34. How we are to explain the precise number chosen is a problem winch has much exercised the minds of interpreters. I will begin by stating what seems to me the most tenable solution. In doing this I follow Smend and Cornill in taking the LXX. as giving the original reading, and the Hebrew as a later correction, made with a purpose.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Jerome and Origen bear witness to the fact that most copies of the former gave 190 years, some 150 and others, agreeing with the Hebrew, 390. The first of these numbers fits in with the thought that Ezekiel's act was to represent the period of the punishment of the northern kingdom. That punishment starts from the first captivity under Pekah about B.C. 734. Reckoning from that date, the 190 years bring us to about B.C. 544. The punishment of Judah, in like manner, dates from the destruction of Jerusalem in B.C. 586, and the forty years bring us to B.C. 546, a date so near the other, that, in the round numbers which Ezekiel uses, they may be taken as practically coinciding. It was to that date that the prophet, perhaps, unacquainted with Jeremiah's seventy years (Jeremiah 25:12), with a different starting point ( B.C. 600) and terminus ( B.C. 536), looked forward as the starting point of the restoration of Israel. It is obvious that Ezekiel contemplated the contemporaneous restoration of Israel and Judah (Ezekiel 16:53-55; Ezekiel 37:19-22; Ezekiel 47:13), as indeed Isaiah also seems to do (Isaiah 11:13, 14), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:6, 12, 27). The teaching of Ezekiel's acts, then, had two distinct purposes.NEWLINENEWLINE(a) It taught the certainty of the punishment. No plots, or rebellions, or alliances with Egypt, could avert the doom of exile from these who should survive the siege of Jerusalem.NEWLINENEWLINE(b) It taught the exiles to accept their punishment with patience, but with hope. There was a limit, and that not very far off, which some of them might live to see, and beyond which there lay the hope of a restoration for both Israel and Judah. If that hope was not realized to the extent which Ezekiel's language impiles, the same may be, said of the language of Isaiah 40-66, whether we refer those chapters to Isaiah himself or to the \"great unknown\" who followed Ezekiel, and may have listened to his teaching.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Still keeping to the idea of the years of punishment, but taking the Hebrew text, the combination of 390 and 40 gives 430, and this, it is urged, was the number assigned in Exodus 12:40 for the years of the sojourning in Egypt. Then the nation had been one, now it is divided. And the punishment of its two divisions is apportioned according to their respective guilt. For Israel, whose sins had been of a deeper dye, there was to be, as it were, another Egyptian bondage (Hosea 8:13 and Hosea 9:3 seem to predict a literal return to Egypt, but Hosea 11:5 shows it to have been figurative only). For Judah there was to be another quasi-wandering in the wilderness for forty years a period of punishment, but also of preparation lot a re-entry into the land of promise (Currey, Gardiner).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) A somewhat fanciful variation on the preceding view connects the 390 days with the forty stripes of Deuteronomy 25:3, reduced by Jewish preachers to \"forty stripes save one\" (2 Corinthians 11:24). Thus thirty-nine were assigned to each of the ten tribes, leaving forty for Judah standing by itself. With this additionNEWLINENEWLINE(3) merges intoNEWLINENEWLINE(2).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The traditional Jewish interpretation, on the other hand (Kimchi), sees in the number of the years the measure, not of the punishment, but of the guilt of Israel and Judah respectively. That of the former is measured (as in the margin of the Authorized Version) from the revolt of the ten tribes ( B.C. 975) to the time at which Ezekiel received the commands with which we are now dealing ( B.C. 595). This computation gives, it is true, only 380 years; but the prophet may be thought of as dealing with round numbers, the 390 being, perhaps, chosen for the reason indicated in (3), or as reckoning with a different chronology. The forty years of the guilt of Judah are, on this view, reckoned from Josiah's reformation ( B.C. 624), which would bring us to B.C. 585-4. And the sin of Judah is thought of as consisting specially in its resistance to that reformation and its rapid relapse into an apostasy like that of Ahaz or Manasseh. It can hardly be said that this is a satisfactory explanation.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) Yet another view has been suggested, sc. that the siege of Jerusalem lasted, in round numbers, for 430 days - a day for each year of the national guilt as measured in the last hypothesis. Against this there is the fact that, according to the statements in 2 Kings 25:1-3, the siege lasted for much more than the 430 days, sc. for nearly a year and a half. The conclusion to which I am led, after examining the several hypotheses, is, as I have sail, in favour of (1). The text of the Hebrew, as we find it, may have risen out of the tinct that the ten tribes had not returned as a body, and that there was no sign of their return, when Judah returned in B.C. 536, and therefore a larger number was inserted to allow time for a more adequate interval.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Each day for a year. The Hebrew formula is that of iteration - \"a day for a year, a day for a year.\" It originates, as has been said, in Numbers 14:34. What has been known as the year-day theory of prophetic interpretation flows naturally from it, and has been appliedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to the \"seventy weeks\" of Daniel 9:24-27, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the twelve hundred and sixty and the three days and a half of Revelation 11:3, 9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thine arm shall be uncovered. This, as in Isaiah 52:10, was the symbol of energetic action. The prophet was to be, as it were, no apathetic spectator of the siege which he was thus dramatizing, but is as the representative of the Divine commission to control and guide it. The picture of the prophet's attitude, not merely resting on his side and folding his hands, as a man at ease might do, but looking intently, with bare outstretched arm, at the scene portrayed by him, must, we may well imagine, have added to the startling effect of the whole procedure. We note the phrase, \"set thy face,\" as specially characteristic of Ezekiel (here, and, though the Hebrew verb is not the same, Ezekiel 14:8; Ezekiel 15:7). The words \"prophesy against it\" may imply some spoken utterance of the nature of a \"woe,\" like that of the son of Ananus (see above), but hardly, I think, a prolonged address.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I will lay bands upon thee, etc. The words point to the supernatural constraint which would support the prophet in a position as trying as that of an Indian yogi or a Stylite monk. He would himself be powerless to move (exceptis excipiendis, as before) from the prescribed position. There is, perhaps, a reference to Ezekiel 3:25. The people would have \"put bands\" upon the prophet to hinder his work; Jehovah will \"put bands\" upon him to help, nay, to constrain, him to finish it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Take thou also unto thee, etc. The act implies, as I have said, that there were exceptions to the generally immovable attitude. The symbolism seems to have a twofold meaning. We can scarcely exclude a reference to the famine which accompanied the siege. On the other hand, one special feature of it is distinctly referred, not to the siege, but to the exile (ver. 13). Starting with the former, the prophet is told to make bread, not of wheat, the common food of the wealthier class (Deuteronomy 32:14; Psalm 81:16; Psalm 147:14; Jeremiah 12:13; Jeremiah 41:8), nor of barley, the chief food of the poor (Ezekiel 13:19; Hosea 3:2; John 6:9), but of these mixed with beans (2 Samuel 17:28), lentils (2 Samuel 17:28; Genesis 25:34) - then, as now, largely used in Egypt and other Eastern countries - millet (the Hebrew word is not found elsewhere), and fitches, i.e. vetches (here also the Hebrew word is found only in this passage, that so translated in Isaiah 28:25-27 standing, it is said, for the seed of the black cummin). The outcome of this mixture would be a coarse, unpalatable bread, not unlike that to which the population of Paris was reduced in the siege of 1870-71. This was to be the prophet's food, as it was to be that of the people of Jerusalem during the 390 days by which that siege was symbolically, though not numerically, represented. It is not improbable, looking to the prohibition against mixtures of any kind in Deuteronomy 22:9, that it would be regarded as in itself unclean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thy meat, etc.; better, food, here and elsewhere. Coarse as the food was, the people would have but scanty rations of it. Men were not, as usual, to measure the corn, but to weigh the bread (Leviticus 26:26). Taking the shekel at about 220 grains, the twenty shekels would be about 10 or 12 ounces. The common allowance in England for prison or pauper dietaries gives, I believe from 24 to 32 ounces, Besides other food. And this was to be taken, not as hunger prompted, but at the appointed hour. once a day. The whole scene of the people of the besieged city coming for their daily rations is brought vividly before us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The sixth, part of an hin, etc. According to the varying accounts of the \"hin\" given by Jewish writers, this would give from .6 to .9 of a pint. And this was, like the food, to be doled out once a day. Possibly \"the bread of affliction and the water of affliction,\" in 1 Kings 22:27 and Isaiah 30:20, contains a reference to the quantity as well as the quality of a prison dietary as thus described. Isaiah's words may refer to the siege of Sennacherib, as Ezekiel's do to the siege of Nebuchadnezzar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou shall bake it with dung, etc. The process of baking in ashes was as old as the time of Abraham (Genesis 18:6), and continues in Arabia and Syria to the present day. The kneaded dough was rolled into thin flat cakes, and they were placed upon, or hung over, the hot wood embers of the hearth or oven. But in a besieged city the supply of wood for fuel soon fails. The first resource is found, as still often happens in the East, in using the dried dung of camels or of cattle. Before Ezekiel's mind there came the vision of a yet more terrible necessity. That supply also might tail, and then men would be forced to use the dried contents of the \"draught houses\" or cesspools of Jerusalem. They would be compelled almost literally to fulfil the taunt of Rabshakeh (Isaiah 36:12). That thought, as bringing with it the ceremonial pollution of Leviticus 5:3: 7:21, was as revolting to Ezekiel as it is to us; but like Dante, in a like revolting symbolism ('Inf.,' 18:114), he does not shrink from naming it. It came to him, as with the authority of a Divine command, that he was even to do this, to represent the extreme horrors of the siege. And all this was to be done visibly, before the eyes of his neighbours at Tel-Abib.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Even thus shall the children of Israel, etc. The strange command takes a wider range. It symbolizes, not the literal horrors of the siege, but the \"defiled bread\" which even the exiles would be reduced to eat. So taken, the words remind us of the risk of eating unclean, food, which almost inevitably attended the position of the exiles (Hosea 9:3; Daniel 1:8), and which, it may be, Ezekiel had already tell keenly. There is obviously something more than can be explained by a reference to \"the bitter bread of banishment,\" or to Dante's \"Come sa di sale... \" ('Par.,' 17:58).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Then said I, Ah, Lord God! etc. The formula is, curiously enough, equally characteristic of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 9:8; Ezekiel 11:13; Ezekiel 20:49) and of his teacher and contemporary (Jeremiah 1:6; Jeremiah 4:10; Jeremiah 14:13; Jeremiah 32:17). The Vulgate represents it by A, a, a. His plea, which reminds us at once of Daniel 1:8 and Acts 10:14, is that he has kept himself free from all ceremonial pollution connected with food. And is he, a priest too, to do this? That be far from him! Anything but that! The kinds of defilement of which he speaks are noted in Exodus 22:31; Leviticus 7:24; Leviticus 11:39, 40; Leviticus 17:15. The \"abominable things\" may refer either to the unclean meats catalogued in Deuteronomy 14:3-21 (as e.g. in Isaiah 65:4), or as in the controversy of the apostolic age (Acts 15; 1 Corinthians 8:1; Revelation 2:20), to eating any flesh that had been offered in sacrifice to idols. The prophet's passionate appeal is characteristic of the extent to which his character had been influenced by the newly discovered Law of the Lord (2 Kings 22; 2 Chronicles 34.), i.e. probably by the Book of Deuteronomy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Lo, I have given thee, etc. The concession mitigates the horror of the first command, though even this was probably regarded as involving some ceremonial uncleanness. It served, at any rate, to represent, in some measure, the pressure of the siege.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The staff of bread. The phrase occurs again in Ezekiel 5:16; Ezekiel 14:13, and also in Leviticus 26:26; Psalm 105:16. In Isaiah 3:1 the thought is the same, but the Hebrew word is different. They shall eat bread by weight, etc. The phrase occurs, it may be noted, in Leviticus 26:26, one of the verses above referred to. The care and astonishment, implying that the wonted cheerfulness of meals would have departed, meet us again in Ezekiel 12:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Consume away for their iniquity, etc. Another echo from the book which had entered so largely into the prophet's education (see Leviticus 26:39, where the Hebrew for \"pine\" is the same as that here rendered \"consume\"). To the wretchedness of physical privation there was to be added the consciousness of the sufferers that it was caused by their own evil deeds.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's rasor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Take thee a barber's razor, etc. The series of symbolic acts is carried further. Recollections of Isaiah and Leviticus mingle strangely in the prophet's mind. The former had made the \"razor\" the symbol of the devastation wrought by an invading army (Isaiah 7:20). The latter had forbidden its use for the head and beard of the priests (Leviticus 19:27; Leviticus 21:5). Once again Ezekiel is commanded to do a forbidden thing as a symbolic act. He is, for the moment, the representative of the people of Jerusalem, and there is to be, as of old, a great destruction of that people as \"by a razor that is hired.\" The word for \"barber\" (perhaps \"hair cutter\") does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament, but its use may be noted as showing that then, as now, the \"barber\" was a recognized institution in every Eastern town. The word for \"knife\" (Joshua 5:2; 1 Kings 18:28) is used in ver. 2, and commonly throughout the Old Testament, for \"sword,\" and is so translated here by the LXX. and Vulgate. The prophet is to take a \"sword\" and use it as a razor, to make the symbolism more effective.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou shalt burn with fire, etc. The symbolism receives its interpretation in ver. 12. A third part of the people (we need not expect numerical exactness) was to perish in the city of pestilence and famine, another to fall by the sword in their attempts to escape, yet another third was to be scattered to the far off land of their exile, and even there the sword was to follow them. The words, in the midst of the city, and the days of the siege, find their most natural explanation in Ezekiel 4:1, 5, 6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - Thou shalt also take, etc. The words may pointNEWLINENEWLINE(1) either to those in Jerusalem who had escaped the famine and the sword, and were left in the land (2 Kings 25:22; Jeremiah 40:6; Jeremiah 40:6); orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to those who should go into exile, and yet even there suffer from the \"fire\" of God's chastening judgments. They were, if saved at all, to be saved \"so as by fire\" (1 Corinthians 3:15), to be as \"brands plucked from the burning\" (Amos 4:11; Zechariah 3:2). Isaiah's thought of the \"remnant\" (Isaiah 10:20-22; Isaiah 11:11-16) seems hardly to come in here. The whole utterance is one of denunciation. The act of \"binding in the skirts\" implies only a limited protection. Omit \"for,\" and for \"thereof\" read \"therefrom,\" s.c. from the fire (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This is Jerusalem, etc. The strange acted parables cease, and we have the unfigurative interpretation. The words that follow point to the central position of Jerusalem in the geography, and therefore in the history, of the ancient East: Egypt to the south, Assyria and Babylon to the north, and in the nearer distance Moabites and Ammonites, and Edomites, and Phoenicians, and Philistines; to all of these Jerusalem might have been as a city set on a hill, as the light of the Gentiles. That had been her ideal position from the first, as in the visions of Micah 4:1 and Isaiah 2:1 it was to be in its ideal future. The words are not without interest, as probably having suggested the thought, prominent in mediaeval geography (Dante, 'Inf.,' 34:115, and the Hereford 'Mappa Mundi'), that Jerusalem was physically the central point of the earth's surface. So Moslems believe Mecca to be the earth's centre, and the Greek word omphalos was applied to Delphi as implying the same beliefNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - She hath changed, etc. To that calling Jerusalem had been unfaithful. Corruptio optimi pessima, and she had sunk to a lower level than the nations round about her. For changed my judgments into wickedness, read, with the Revised Version, hath rebelled against my judgments in doing wickedness. The pronoun refers, not to the nations, but to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and so in the next clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Because ye multiplied, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, because ye are turbulent. The vereb is cognate with the noun translated \"tumult\" in 1 Samuel 4:14; Psalm 65:7; Isaiah 33:3, though it is more commonly rendered \"multitude.\" It is not (as stated by Currey and Gardiner) the verb rendered \"rage\" in Psalm 2:1. The former meaning fits in fairly here, hot some critics (Smend) suppose that the text is corrupt. A conjectural emendation gives, \"ye were counted with the nations.\" Neither have done according to the judgments; better, with the Revised Version, ordinances. Taking the words as they stand, the words find their explanation in Jeremiah 2:10, 11. In doing as the nations (Ezekiel 11:12; Ezekiel 16:47), Jerusalem had not done as they did, for they were at least true to the gods whom they worshipped, and she had rebelled against her God. Some Hebrew manuscripts and some versions omit the negative, but this is probably a correction made in order to bring about a verbal agreement with Ezekiel 11:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Therefore, etc. The conjunction is emphatic.

The words of Jeremiah 19:9 and Lamentations 4:10 imply that horrors such as these occurred during the siege of the city by the Chaldeans, as they had occurred before in the siege of Samaria (2 Kings 6:28, 29), and were to occur afterwards in that by the Romans (Josephus, 'Bell Jud.,' 6:4. § 4). The whole remnant, etc. (comp. ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Because thou hast defiled my sanctuary, etc. For the full account of the nature of the abominations which are thus spoken of, see notes on ch. 8. This was, after all, the root evil of all other evils. Pollution of worship, the degradation of the highest element in man's nature, passed into pollution and degradation of his whole life. Even in our Lord's acted teaching, in John 2:15, 16 and Matthew 21:12, we have the same principle implied. Therefore will I also diminish thee, etc. The italics show that the last word is not in the Hebrew. The Revised Version margin suggests two other renderings.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Therefore will I also withdraw mine eye that it shall not spare; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) Therefore will I hew thee down. To these we may add the LXX. I will reject, and the Vulgate I will break in pieces, which apparently, like (2), imply a different reading. Most recent critics suggest conjectural emendations of the text. I incline to rest satisfied with the Authorized Version, and to explain it by Ezekiel 16:27. The word implies not only the decrease, but the entire withdrawal of Jehovah's favour. Possibly there is an implied reference to the command of Deuteronomy 4:2; Deuteronomy 12:32. Jerusalem had \"diminished\" from the Law of God, had, as it were, erased the commandments which were of supreme obligation, and therefore, as by a lex talionis, God would diminish her. Neither will I have any pity. The words are, of course, anthropomorphic, and have therefore to be received with the necessary limitations. As the earthly minister of justice must not yield to a weak pity which would be incompatible with the assertion of the eternal law of righteousness, so neither will the Supreme Judge. There is a time for all things, and justice must do its work first, in order that there may be room for pity afterwards. For other assertions, which seems strange to us, of trials unpitying character of God, see Ezekiel 7:4, 9; Ezekiel 8:18; Ezekiel 9:10, et al.; Jeremiah 13:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A third part of thee, etc. (see note on ver. 2). The strange symbolic act is now interpreted. I will draw out a sword, etc. The phrase recurs in Ezekiel 12:14, and is found in Leviticus 26:33 - an echo, like so many other passages in Ezekiel, from what seems to have been his favourite storehouse of thought and language (Leviticus 17-26.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I will cause my fury to rest upon them, etc.; Revised Version, I will satisfy, etc. The phrase meets us again in Ezekiel 16:42; Ezekiel 21:17; Ezekiel 24:13. To \"rest\" here is to \"repose\" rather than to \"abide.\" The thought is that a righteous anger, like that of Jehovah, rests (i.e. is quieted) when it has done its work, and that in this sense God is \"comforted,\" either as rejoicing in the punishment of evil for its own sake (as in Deuteronomy 28:63; Isaiah 1:24), or because the punishment does its work in leading men to repentance. Israel may be comforted, because God is comforted as he sees that his judgments have done their work, and that his wrath can find repose. Have spoken in my zeal. The thought implied is that what is spoken in the earnest purpose of \"zeal\" will assuredly be carried into execution (comp. Isaiah 9:7; Isaiah 37:32). Men might deride the prophet's warning as an idle threat. It would prove itself to have come from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In the sight of them that pass by. The phrase reminds us of Lamentations 1:12; Lamentations 2:15: and the latter was probably a conscious reproduction of it. The scorn and mockery of the heathen who rejoiced in her humiliation were to be the keenest pang in the punishment of the guilty city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A reproach and a taunt, etc. An echo of Deuteronomy 28:37. The accumulation of synonyms in both clauses of the verse is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel's style. Word follows word, like the strokes of a sledge hammer. The word for \"instruction\" is that which occurs so often in the Book of Proverbs (Proverbs 1:2, 3, and in twenty-two other passages). In Deuteronomy 11:12; Isaiah 53:5; Jeremiah 30:14, the Authorized Version renders it \"chastisement,\" and that sense is manifestly implied here. Jerusalem was, as it were, to be the great object lesson in God's education of mankind. And the final stroke of all is that the words were not the prophet's own, but \"I the Lord have spokes it.\" The words reappear in ver. 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The evil arrows of famine, etc. The thought of the \"arrows\" of God's judgment may have been taken from Deuteronomy 32:23, 42, and occurs frequently also in the Psalms (Psalm 7:13; Psalm 38:2, et al.). Clothed in the language of poetry, the attributes of Jehovah included those of the Far-darter of the Greeks. Which shall be for their destruction, etc.; better, as Revised Version, that are for destruction. Ewald looks on the noun as a personification, like Abaddon, also translated \"destruction\" in Job 28:22 and Proverbs 15:11, and renders the words, \"that are from hell;\" but there seems no special reason for assuming such a meaning here. It is noticable that, as in the symbolism of Ezekiel 4:9-17, the laminae is more prominent in Ezekiel's thoughts than the other punishments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Evil beasts, etc. These appear in like connection in Ezekiel's favourite textbooks (comp. Leviticus 26:6, 22; Deuteronomy 32:24). They reappear in Ezekiel 14:15, 21. Historically, we have an example of the suffering thus caused in the lions of 2 Kings 17:25, when towns and villages were deserted, and the unburied carcases of those who had died by famine, or pestilence, or the sword, were everywhere to attract them from afar. This was, of course, the natural and inevitable result. Pestilence and blood, etc. As this is followed by the work of the sword, \"blood\" probably points to some special form of plague, possibly dysentery (Acts 28:8, Revised Version), or carbuncles, like Hezekiah's boil (Isaiah 38:21). The same combination appears in Ezekiel 14:19; Ezekiel 28:23.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSon of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - Set thy face toward the mountains, etc. The formula is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel. We have had it with a different verb in the Hebrew, in Ezekiel 4:3. It will meet us again in Ezekiel 20:46; Ezekiel 21:2; Ezekiel 25:2; Ezekiel 28:21; Ezekiel 29:2; Ezekiel 35:2; Ezekiel 38:2. In this case it probably implied an outward act, like that of Daniel, when he, with a very different purpose, looked towards Jerusalem (Daniel 6:10). In contrast with the widespread plains of Mesopotamia in which Ezekiel found himself, this was the chief characteristic of the land which he had left. The mountains represent the whole country, including the rivers (Revised Version, here and throughout, renders the Hebrew \"water courses,\" to distinguish it from the \"river\" (nahar) of Ezekiel 1:1, 3, et al., and the \"river\" (nachal) of Ezekiel 47:5. Its strict meaning is that of a \"ravine\" or \"gorge,\" the wady of modern Arabic, through which a stream rushes in the winter, but is dried up in the summer). All the localities are named as having been alike polluted by the worship of idols For mountains and hills as the scenes of such worship, see Deuteronomy 12:2; 2 Kings 17:10, 11; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:6; Hosea 4:13; for the ravines and valleys, 2 Kings 23:10 and Jeremiah 7:31 (the Valley of Hinnom); and more generally, Isaiah 57:5, 6. The same combination meets us in ch. 35:8; 36:5, 6. In his address to the mountains, Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of Micah 6:2. I will destroy your high places. The words point to the most persistent, though not the worst, of all the idolatries by which the worship of Jehovah as the God of Israel had been overshadowed. The words of Ezekiel are identical with those of Leo, 26:30. The Bamoth, or high places, of Baal, are mentioned in Numbers 22:41 and Joshua 13:17, and are probably identical with the high places of Arnon in Numbers 21:28. There they are named only incidentally, not in the way of prohibition or condemnation. So, in like manner, in Deuteronomy 32:13 and Deuteronomy 33:29, if the technical sense exists at all, it is referred to only as included in the triumph of the worship of Jehovah over the hill fortresses as the sanctuaries of other gods. The absence of the word from the Book of Judges is difficult to explain, as it was precisely in that period of the history of Israel, irregular and unsettled, that we should have expected to find the people adopting the cultus of their neighbours. A probable solution of the problem is that, so long as the tabernacle and the ark were at Shiloh, that was so pre-eminently the centre of the worship of Jehovah, that the people were not tempted to forsake it, or to set up the worship upon the high places side by side with it. When, after the capture of the ark, Shiloh was a deserted sanctuary, we meet for the first time with the worship of the high places, not as a thing forbidden, but as sanctioned by the presence of Samuel, as the judge and prophet of the people (1 Samuel 9:12-14; 1 Samuel 10:5), the \"high place\" in the last passage being, apparently, the same as \"the hill of God.\" In 2 Samuel 1:19, possibly from the Book of Jashar, we have the elder, less technical sense of Deuteronomy 32:12 and Deuteronomy 33:19. It would seem, accordingly, as if Samuel had acted on a policy like that of the counsel which Gregory I gave Augustine. He found the worship of the high places adopted by the Israelites from the neighbouring nations. He sought to turn them to the worship of Jehovah. So the writer of 1 Kings 3:2 records the fact that \"the people sacrificed in high places,\" because as yet, though the ark had been brought to Jerusalem, \"there was no house built unto the Name of Jehovah until those days,\" and that Solomon himself also \"sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.\" At the chief of these, the great high place of Gibeon, Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings, and had the memorable vision in which he made choice of wisdom rather than length of days, or riches and honour, returning from it, as though the cultus of the two places stood nearly on an equal footing, to offer other burnt offerings before the ark of God at Jerusalem (1 Kings 3:3-15). With the erection of the temple the state of things was, in some measure, altered, and the temple was the one legitimate sanctuary. When the ten tribes revolted under Jeroboam, they were, of course, cut off from the temple services, and the king accordingly, besides the calves at Bethel and Dan, set up high places, with priests not of the sons of Aaron, in the cities of Samaria (1 Kings 12:31; 1 Kings 13:32). From that time forward the high places are always mentioned by both historians and prophets in a tone of condemnation, whether they were in Israel or Judah (1 Kings 14:4), but they had become so deeply rooted in the reverence of the people that even the better kings of Judah, who warred against open idolatry, like Asa (1 Kings 15:14), Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 22:43), Jehoash (2 Kings 12:3), Amaziah (2 Kings 14:4), Azariah (2 Kings 15:4), left them undisturbed; while in the history of the northern kingdom the cultus of the Bamoth reigned paramount (2 Kings 17, passim). It was not till Hezekiah, presumably under Isaiah's influence, removed the \"high places\" (2 Kings 18:4) that we find any serious attempt to put them down. They had been tolerated, apparently, because, as in Rabshakeh's taunt (2 Kings 18:22), they were nominally connected with the worship of Jehovah. Under the confluent polytheism of Manasseh they naturally reappeared (2 Kings 21:3: 2 Chronicles 33:3). The reformation of Josiah was more thorough (2 Kings 23, passim; 2 Chronicles 34:3), and was probably stimulated by Hilkiah and Huldah. The discovery of the book of the Law (probably Deuteronomy), with its condemnations of mountain sanctuaries, though, as we have seen, the Bamoth were not prohibited by name, roused the zeal of the prophets, especially of the priest prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and when the Bamoth-cultus revived, after the death of Josiah, the former was strong in his protests (Jeremiah 7:31, et al.), all the more so because now, as in the earlier stages of their history, they had become high places of Baal (Jeremiah 19:5; 32:55), and were associated with abominations like those of the worship of Moloch in the Valley of Hinnom. So it was that Ezekiel, writing on the banks of the Chebar, is now led to place them in the forefront of the sins of his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Your images, etc. The \"sun images\" of the Revised Version shows why these are mentioned as distinct from the \"idols.\" The chammanim were pillars or obelisks identified with the worship of Baal as the sun god, standing on his altars (2 Chronicles 34:4), coupled with the \"groves,\" or Asherim (Isaiah 17:8; Isaiah 27:9), and with the \"high places\" in 2 Chronicles 14:5. I will cast down your slain men before your idols. As in the prophecy against Bethel (1 Kings 13:2), and in Josiah's action (2 Kings 33:16), this was the ne plus ultra of desecration. Where throe had been the sweet savour of incense there should be the sickening odour of the carcases of the slain. The word for \"idols\" (gillulim), though found elsewhere, notably in Ezekiel's favourite textbooks (Leviticus 26:30; Deuteronomy 29:17), is more prominent in his writings (where it occurs thirty-six times) then in any other book of the Old Testament, and means, primarily, a cairn or heap of stones, which, like the \"sun images,\" came to be associated with Baal. Ezekiel repeats both words in ver. 6, with all the emphasis of scorn. He predicts the coming of a time when the work of destruction should be done more thoroughly than even Josiah lind done it. When that time came, the familiar formula, \"Ye shall know that I am the Lord,\" should receive yet another fulfilment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Yet will I leave a remnant, ere. The thought, though not the word, is that of Isaiah 1:9; Isaiah 10:20; Zephaniah 2:7; Zephaniah 3:13; Jeremiah 43:5. For these, at least, the punishment would, in greater or less measure, do its work; and, in remembering Jehovah, they would find the beginning of conversion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Because I am broken with their whorish heart. The words have been very differently rendered.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The Revised Version mainly follows the Authorized Version, but gives, they shall remember... how I have been broken, etc. So taken, the words are boldly anthropomorphic, and ascribe to Jehovah the word which implies the strongest form of human distress. The \"whorish heart\" of the people has made Jehovah himself \"broken-hearted.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Most recent critics, however, follow the rendering of the Vulgate (contrivi), and take the verb, which is passive in form, as being like a Greek verb in the middle voice, transitive in form, with an implied reflex force. So we get, as in the margin of the Revised Version, \"I have broken their whorish heart.\" So taken, thought and words are both connected with Psalm 51:17, and the self-loathing that follows has its counterpart in Job 42:6. The thought is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 20:43; Ezekiel 36:31), and, we may add also, of Leviticus (Leviticus 26:39-42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I have not said in vain, etc. The thought of that self-loathing and repentance reconciles Ezekiel to his work. To \"labour in vain\" is the great misery of all workers for God. A time will come when he shall see that God has not sent him to such a work \"in vain.\" What before was dark will be made clear unto him (comp. Ezekiel 14:23). Ezekiel's words, \"not in vain,\" are echoed frequently by St. Paul (1 Corinthians 15:14, 58; 2 Corinthians 6:1; Philippians 2:16, et al.). The corresponding phrase, \"I have broken their eyes,\" sounds strange to us; but, after all, the heart is not literally broken more than the eyes, and figuratively the same words may be applied to either, so that there is no need for supposing, with some critics, that a more appropriate verb has been dropped out. Eyes and heart were alike involved in the sin (Ezekiel 20:7, 8, 24; Numbers 15:39), and both came under the same chastisement that was to lead them to repentance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Smite with thine hand, etc. The outward gestures were to give a dramatic emphasis to the mingled indignation and sorrow with which the prophet was to utter his woe. A like action meets us in Ezekiel 21:12. Instances of its use for other feelings meet us in Ezekiel 22:13; Numbers 24:10 (anger); Jeremiah 31:19 (shame).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He that is far off, etc. The three forms of judgment named in ver. 11 have each their special victims. Pestilence comes chiefly on those who are outside the city, exposed to the weather changes and the taint of unburied corpses (ver. 5); the sword of the Chaldeans on those who venture on a sally, or try to escape from the city; famine presses heaviest on those who are besieged within it. None can escape the judgment. The word besieged is the same as in Isaiah 1:8; but it may have the sense, as in Isaiah 49:6, of \"kept,\" or \"preserved,\" for the worst evil of the three.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The thought is the same as in ver. 6, but the localities are given in greater detail. The \"hills\" and \"mountains\" were naturally the scenes of the worship of the \"high places,\" and these were commonly associated with groves of trees, as in Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:6; Isaiah 57:5. In Hosea 4:13, oaks (or terebinths), poplars, and elms are specifically named (comp. Deuteronomy 12:2; 2 Kings 16:4). Where they did offer sweet savour, etc. The phrase is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel as a priest (Ezekiel 16:19; Ezekiel 20:28, 41), and is specially prominent in the books which he must have studied. It meets us three times in Exodus, seventeen in Leviticus, seventeen in Numbers, and seldom elsewhere. The crowning sin, from the prophet's point of view, was that the incense which was due to Jehovah had been lavished on the false gods of the nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - More desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath; better, with the Authorized Version, from the wilderness. The name does not appear elsewhere, and has not been identified. Assuming the Authorized Version rendering, we must think of Ezekiel as naming, as Dante haines the Valdichiana ('Inf.,' 29:47), some specially horrible and desolate region. For such a region the name of Diblah (a cake of figs) does not seem appropriate. Taking the Revised Version translation (\"from the wilderness toward Diblah\"), we have a phrase analogous to \"from Dan to Beersheba,\" as denoting the extent of the desolation. The \"wilderness\" is usually applied to the nomad region south of Palestine, and this would lead us to look for Diblah in the north, and so to look elsewhere than to the two places Beth-diblathaim (Jeremiah 48:22) and Almon-diblathaim (Numbers 33:46), both of which are in Moab. The difficulty was solved by Jerome by the conjectural emendation of Riblah, the two Hebrew letters for d and r being often written by copyists for each other. Riblah (it is a suggestive fact that the two chief manuscripts of the LXX. the Alexandrian and the Vatican, have Deblatha, or Deblaa, in 2 Kings 23:33; 2 Kings 25:6) was a fortified town on the north road from Palestine to Babylon, where the Babylonian kings used to take up their position during their invasions of the former. Within a short time after Ezekiel wrote this chapter, it became memorable in its connection with Zedekiah's sufferings (comp. 2 Kings 23:33; 2 Kings 25:6, 20, 21; Jeremiah 39:5, 6; Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26). Its probable site is fixed on the banks of the Orontes. The evidence, on the whole, is, I think, in favour of this interpretation. It is adopted by Ewald, Cornill, Smend, Gesenius, and most recent critics. An additional fact in its favour is that Hamath, in the same region, appears as an ideal northern boundary in Ezekiel 47:16.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The absence of any fresh date, and the fact that it is simply tacked on to the previous chapter by the copulative conjunction, shows that what follows belongs to the same group. The use of the phrase, the word of the Lord came unto me, shows, however, that there was an interval of silence, perhaps of meditation, followed by a fresh influx of inspiration; and, so far as we may judge from the more lyrical character of the chapter, a more intense emotion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - An end, etc. The iteration of the word once more gives emphasis. The words read like an echo of Amos 8:2. The four corners (Hebrew, \"wings\") were probably, as with us, the north, east, south, and west. The phrase had been used before in Isaiah 11:12, and the thought meets us again, in the form of the \"four winds,\" in Daniel 11:4; Zechariah 2:6; Matthew 24:31; Mark 13:27. The \"end\" in this case is either that of the siege of Jerusalem, or that of the existence of Israel as a nation. It was now drawing nigh - was, as we say, within measurable distance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Now is the end upon thee, etc. We note the repetition of this and ver. 4 in vers. 8, 9, as a kind of refrain in the lamentation. Stress is laid, and for the time laid exclusively, on the unpitying character of the Divine judgments. And this is followed as before, in Ezekiel 6:14, by \"Ye shall know that I am the Lord.\" Fear must teach men the lesson which love had failed to teach.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee, etc. These are, of course, primarily the idolatries of Israel. The people are to reap what they have sown. Their sins should be recognized in their punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - An evil, an only evil, etc. The words imply that the evil would be unique in character, attracting men's notice, not needing repetition. Cornill, however, following Luther, gives \"evil after evil,\" changing one letter m the Hebrew for \"one,\" so as to get the word \"after.\" For is come read, with the Revised Version, it cometh. It is the nearness, not the actual arrival, of the end, that is in the prophet's thoughts. He writes in B.C. 595-4. Jerusalem was not taken till s.c.588NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - It watcheth for thee; better, with the Revised Version, it awaketh against thee. So the LXX., Vulgate, Luther. The Hebrew presents a paronomasia between the noun and verb - hakketz, hekitz - which cannot be reproduced in English. The destined doom is thought of as rousing itself to its appointed work. The word is cognate with that rendered \"awaketh\" in Psalm 78:65.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The morning is come unto thee, etc. In the only other passage in which the Hebrew noun occurs (Isaiah 28:5), it is translated \"diadem,\" the meaning being strictly a circular ornament. Here the LXX. gives πλοκὴ, something twirled, out of which may come the meaning of the changes of fortune. Possibly, as in the familiar \"wheel of fortune,\" that thought was involved in the circular form by itself. In the Tahnud it appears as the name of the goddess of fate at Ascalon (Furst). On the whole, I follow the Revised Version, Keil, and Ewald, in giving \"thy doom.\" The \"morning\" of the Authorized Version probably rises from the thought that the dawn is, as it were, the glory and diadem of the day. The Vulgate gives contritio. The day of trouble; better, with the Revised Version, of tumult. The word is specially used of the noise of war (Isaiah 22:5; Amos 3:9; Zechariah 14:3). Not the sounding again upon the mountains. The first noun is not found in the Old Testament, but a closely allied form appears in Isaiah 16:9; Jeremiah 25:30; Jeremiah 48:33, for the song of the vintage. Not that, the prophet says, shall be heard on the mountains, but in its place the cry of battle and the noise of war. The LXX. \"not with travail-pangs,\" and the Vulgate non gloriae montium, show that the word was in both cases a puzzle to the translators.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The verses repeat, like the burden of a lyric ode, but end more emphatically, ye shall know that I am Jehovah that smiteth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - It is come. Read, as before, it cometh; and for morning, doom (see note on ver. 7). The rod hath blossomed, etc. The three verbs imply a climax. The \"doom\" springs out of the earth; the rod of vengeance blossoms (the word is the same as that which describes the blooming of Aaron's rod (Numbers 17:8), and the phrase was probably suggested by the history); pride (either that of the Chaldean ministers of vengeance, or of Israel as working out its own punishment; I incline to the latter) buds and bears fruit. In Isaiah 27:6 the word follows on \"blossom,\" and therefore seems applicable to the formation of the fruit rather than the flower. (For the image of the rod, comp. Psalm 110:2; Isaiah 10:26; Micah 6:9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTViolence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Violence is risen up, etc. The \"violence\" admits of the same twofold interpretation as the \"pride\" of ver. 10. None of them shall remain. The interpolated verb, though grammatically necessary, weakens the force of the Hebrew. \"None of them; none of their multitude; none of their wealth.\" Neither shall there be wailing for them. The noun is not found elsewhere. Taken, as the Authorized Version takes it, the thought, like that of Ezekiel 24:16 and Jeremiah 16:4, is that the usual rites of burial would be neglected, and that there would be \"no widows to make lamentation\" (Psalm 78:64). The Revised Version \"eminency\" implies the loss of all that constituted greatness. Cornill and the LXX. (\"beauty\" or \"gaiety\") practically agree with this. The Vulgate gives requies, and Furst \"a gathering, or tumult of the people.\" Probably the text is corrupt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Let not the buyer rejoice, etc. We have to read, between the lines, the story of Ezekiel's companions in exile. They belonged, it will be remembered, to the nobler and wealthier class (2 Kings 25:19). They, it would seem, had been compelled to sell their estates at a price which made the \"buyer rejoice and the seller mourn.\" In each case the joy and the sorrow would be but transient. Wrath had gone out against the whole multitude. In Micah 2:2 and Isaiah 5:8 we have parallel instances of the advantage taken by the rich of the distress of the old tree holders. In the story of Jeremiah 32:6-16 we have, though from a very different point of view, the history of a like purchase, while the city was actually surrounded by the Chaldeans. The neglect of the sabbatic year (Jeremiah 34:8-17) makes it probable that the jubilee year also (if, indeed, it had ever been more than an ideal) had fallen into desuetude, and that the buyers comforted themselves with the thought that the land they had got, on cheap terms, weald belong to them and their children forever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For the seller shall not return, etc. At first the thought seems only to add to the sorrow of the seller. He is told that he, at least, shall not return to his old estate. Even though they should be alive at the year of jubilee, their exile had to last its appointed time, Ezekiel's forty (Ezekiel 4:6) and Jeremiah's seventy years (Jeremiah 25:11). This, however, did not exclude the return of their children (Jeremiah 32:44), and in the mean time all private sorrow would fall into the background as compared with the great public woe of the destruction of the holy city. The vision is touching, etc. The noun is used as a synonym for prophecy, as elsewhere (Isaiah 1:1; Nahum 1:1; Habakkuk 2:1). It may be noted that it is specially characteristic of Ezekiel (seven times) and Daniel (eleven times). For the Authorized Version read with the Revised Version, none shall return, or better (with the Vulgate and Keil), the vision touching the whole multitude shall not return, i.e. shall go straight onward to do its work (comp. Isaiah 55:11). So taken, there is a kind of play upon the iterated word: \"The seller shall not turn his footsteps back, neither shall the prophecy.\" Vestigia nulla retrorsum shall be true of both. I take the other words, with the Revised Version, no man in the iniquity of his life shall strengthen himself, noting the fact that the word for \"strengthen\" is that which enters into Ezekiel's name. It is as though he said, \"God is the only true source of strength to thee, as thy very name bears witness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They have blown the trumpet. The word for \"trumpet\" is not found elsewhere, but the corresponding verb is used continually in connection with the trumpet of war, and Ezekiel seems to have coined the corresponding substantive, not, perhaps, without a reminiscence of Jeremiah 6:1. There may possibly be an allusion to the trumpet blowing with which the jubilee year (see ver. 13) was ushered in. The trumpet should sound, not for each man's return to his own estate, but for the alarm of war. and even then the consciousness of guilt will hinder men from arming themselves for battle (comp. Leviticus 26:36; Deuteronomy 28:25; Deuteronomy 32:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The sword is without (see Ezekiel 5:12; Ezekiel 6:12). Here there seems a more traceable fitness in assigning the pestilence as well as the famine to those who are shut up in the besieged city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They that escape, etc. The sentence is virtually conditional. They that escape shall, it is true, in one sense, escape the immediate doom; but if so, it shall only be to the mountains. These were, in all times (Genesis 19:17; Judges 6:2; 1 Samuel 13:6; Psalm 11:1; 1 Macc. 2:28; Matthew 24:16; Mark 13:14), the natural refuge for those who fled from danger, but even this should fail those of whom the prophet speaks. They should be like the doves of the mountain gorges, that are fluttered at the appearance of the eagle or the fowler, and seem by note (Isaiah 38:14; Isaiah 59:11) and gesture (Nahum 2:7), to be mourning forevermore. There also they shall lie, every man in his iniquity, and wailing for its punishment. We are reminded of Dante's similitudes in 'Inf.,' 5:40, 46, 82.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - All knees shall be weak as water; literally, shall flow with water. So the Vulgate. The LXX. is yet stronger, shall be defiled, etc. The words may point to the cold sweat of terror which paralyzes men's power to act. The phrase is peculiar to Ezekiel, and meets us again in Ezekiel 21:7. The thought finds a parallel in Isaiah 13:7; Jeremiah 6:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They shall also gird, etc. The words become more general, and include those who should remain in the city as well as the fugitives. For both there should be the inward feelings of horror and shame, and their outward symbols of sackcloth (Genesis 37:34; 2 Samuel 3:31, 32; 2 Kings 6:30; Isaiah 15:3; Jeremiah 4:8, et al.) and baldness (Isaiah 3:24; Isaiah 15:2; Isaiah 22:12; Amos 8:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They shall cast their silver, etc. The words remind us of Isaiah 2:20 and Isaiah 30:22, with the difference that here it is the silver and gold as such, and not the idols made of them, that are to be flung away. They had made the actual metal their idol, and their confidence in it should be powerless to deliver them (Zephaniah 1:18). Their gold shall be removed; better, with the Revised Version, as an unclean thing. The word implies the kind of impurity of Ezekiel 18:6; Ezekiel 22:10; Ezekiel 36:17; Isaiah 30:22. Instead of gloating, as they had done, over their money, men should shrink from it, as though its very touch brought pollution. The Vulgate gives in sterquilinium, \"to the dunghill.\" They shall not satisfy their souls. In the horrors of the siege, with everything at famine prices (2 Kings 6:25), and little or nothing to be had for them, their money would not stop the cravings of hunger. It is characteristic that he applies to riches as such the very same epithet, stumbling block of their iniquity, as he had applied before (Ezekiel 3:20) to actual idolatry (comp. Colossians 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - As for the beauty of his ornament. The latter word is commonly used of the necklaces, armlets, etc., of women (Exodus 33:4-6; Isaiah 49:18; Jeremiah 2:32; Jeremiah 4:30). So again in Ezekiel 16:7, 11; Ezekiel 23:40. The singular is used of the people collectively, or of each man individually, like German man or French on. He set it in majesty; better, he - or to give the sense they - turned it to pride. Wealth and art had ministered, as in Isaiah 2:16, first to mere pride and pomp; then they made out of their ornaments the idols which they worshipped, and which were now, the same emphatic word being repeated, as a pollution to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I will give it. The \"it\" refers to the silver and gold, the \"beauty of the ornaments\" thus desecrated in their use. The strangers, i.e. the Chaldean invaders, should in their turn pollute (better, with the Revised Version, profane it) by making it their prey. For them the idols which Israel had worshipped would be simply as booty to be plundered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - My secret place. The work of the spoiler would not stop at the idols of silver and gold. Jehovah would surrender his own \"secret place\" (secret treasure in margin of Revised Version), that over which he had watched, sc. the sanctuary of his temple, to the hands of the spoiler. In Psalm 83:4 the same adjective is used of persons, the \"hidden\" or protected ones of God. In the name of Baal-zephon, \"Lord of the secret place,\" we have possibly a kindred thought. In Psalm 17:14 we have \"hid treasure.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Make a chain; better, the chain. The word is not found elsewhere, but a kindred form is thus translated in 1 Kings 6:21. Looking to the force of the verbs from which it is formed, its special meaning is that of a coupling chain, such as would be used in the case of captives marched off to their place of exile (Nahum 3:10). All previous sufferings were to culminate in this. The φυρμόν of the LXX. and the fac conclusionem of the Vulgate show that the word perplexed them. Full of bloody crimes. The only passage in the Authorized Version of the Old Testament in which the English noun occurs. Literally, judgments of blood. The words may be equivalent eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to \"blood guiltiness\" (compare the \"judgment\" in Jeremiah 51:9), orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to judgment perverted into judicial murder. The latter finds support in Ezekiel 9:9. In either case it is noticeable that Ezekiel points not only to idolatry, but to violence and wrong, as the sins that had cried for punishment (comp. Jeremiah 22:17 as a contemporary witness).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The worst of the heathen; literally, evil ones of the nations - with the superlative implied rather than expressed. For the thought, comp. Deuteronomy 28:50; Lamentations 5:11-13; Jeremiah 6:23. The Chaldeans were probably most prominent in the prophet's thoughts, but ch. 35:5 and Psalm 137:7 suggest that there was a side glance at the Edomites. The pomp of the strong, etc. Another echo of Leviticus 26. (ver. 31). The \"pomp\" is that of Judah trusting in her strength. The \"holy places\" find their chief representative in the temple, but, as the word is used also of a non-Jehovistic worship (Ezekiel 28:18; Amos 7:9), may include whatever the people looked on as sanctuaries - the \"high places\" and the like. The Vulgate gives possidebuut sanctuaria; the Revised Version margin, they that sanctify them; but the Authorized Version is probably right in both cases. Luther renders ihre kirchen, which reminds us of Acts 19:37.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDestruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They shall seek peace, etc. The noun is probably to be taken in its wider sense as including safety and prosperity, but may also include specific overtures for peace made to the Chaldean generals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Mischief... turnout. The combination reminds us of the \"wars and rumours of wars\" of Matthew 24:6. The floating uncertain reports of a time of invasion aggravate the actual misery (comp. Isaiah 37:7; Jeremiah 51:46; Obadiah 1:1). They shall seek a vision of the prophet, etc. The words paint a picture of political chaos and confusion. The people turn in their distress to the three representativtes of wisdom - the prophet as the bearer of an immediate message from Jehovah, the priest as the interpreter of his Law (Malachi 2:7), the \"ancients\" or \"elders\" as those who had learnt the lessons of experience, - and all alike in vain. (For illustrative facts, see Jeremiah 5:31; Jeremiah 6:13; Jeremiah 21:2; Jeremiah 23:21-40; Jeremiah 27:9-18; Jeremiah 28:1-9, and generally Micah 3:6; Amos 8:11; 1 Samuel 28:6; Lamentations 2:9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The king shall mourn, etc. The picture reminds us of Jehoram in 2 Kings 6:30. The action of Zedekiah in Jeremiah 21:1 and Jeremiah 34:8 makes it probable enough that it was actually reproduced. A solemn litany procession like that of Joel 1:13, 14 and Joel 2:15-17 would have been quite in keeping with his character. The prince shall clothe himself, etc. The noun is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it thirty-four times. In ch. 12:12 the \"prince\" seems identified with the \"king.\" Here it may mean either the heir to the throne, or the chief ruler under the king. The people of the land, etc. The phrase is perhaps used, as the Jewish rabbis afterwards used it, with a certain touch of scorn, for the labouring class. All the upper class had been carried away captive with Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:14). Compare Ezekiel's use of it in Ezekiel 33:2; Ezekiel 46:3, 9. I will do unto them, etc. The chapter, or rather the whole section from Ezekiel 1:1 onwards, ends with an iterated assertion of the equity of the Divine judgments. Then also they shall know that I am the Lord, Almighty and all-righteous.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And it came to pass, etc. We begin with a fresh date. One year and one month had passed since the vision of Chebar, and had been occupied partly by the acted, partly by the spoken, prophecies of the preceding chapters. In the mean time, things had gone from bad to worse in Jerusalem. In the absence of the higher priests, idolatry was more rampant, and had found its way even into the temple. It is probable that tidings of this had reached Ezekiel, as we know that frequent communications passed between the exiles and those they had left behind (Jeremiah 29:1-3, 9, 25). Directly or indirectly, Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Genesisariah the son of Hilkiah. may have conveyed a message, orally or written, from Jeremiah himself. Some such report may have led to the visit from the elders of Judah, if we understand by that term the exiles of Tel-Abib. I venture, however, on the conjecture that possibly those who came to the prophet were actually visitors who had come from Judah. Elsewhere, as in Ezekiel 14:1 and Ezekiel 20:1, those who thus came are described as \"elders of Israel,\" or the captives (Ezekiel 1:1), \"they of the Captivity\" (Ezekiel 3:15). In either case, the visions that follow gain a special significance. The prophet becomes the seer. It is given to him to know, in a manner which finds a spurious analogue in the alleged mental travelling of the clairvoyant of modern psychology, what is passing in the city from which the messengers had come - and to show that he knows it. With such facts before his eyes, what other answer can there be than that evil must meet its doom? And so we pass into the second series of prophecies which ends with Ezekiel 13:23. It would seem as if the enquirers had kept silent as well as the prophet. We are not told that they asked anything. His look and manner, perhaps also attitude and gesture, forbade utterance. The hand of the Lord - the trance state - was in the act to fall on him (see notes on Ezekiel 3:14, 22). When the trance state was over, we may think of him as reporting and recording what he had thus seen in vision..NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I beheld, and lo a likeness, etc. The vision opens with a theophany like that of ch. 1; but here, as there, Ezekiel uses the word which emphasizes the fact that what he had seen was but a \"likeness\" of the ineffable glory, an image of the Unseen. (For \"amber,\" see Ezekiel 1:4, 27.) In this case we note the absence of the cherubic figures. It is simply the \"appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah,\" seen now in the glow of fire, without the milder, more hopeful brightness of the rainbow (Ezekiel 1:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The form of an hand (comp. Ezekiel 2:9; Daniel 5:5). For the mode of transit, see Bel and the Dragon, ver. 36. as probably a direct imitation. The touch of the \"hand\" was followed by the action of the Spirit, in visions which he knew to be more than dreams, visions that came from God (comp. Ezekiel 1:1; Ezekiel 40:2). The word is not the same as that commonly used by Daniel (chazon), and often by Ezekiel himself (Ezekiel 7:13; Ezekiel 12:22, 23, et al.), but mareh, which implies a more direct act of intuition. The word appears again in Ezekiel 11:24; Ezekiel 43:3, and in Daniel 8:26, 27, et al. To the door of the gate, etc. From the first we trace the priest's familiarity with the structure of the temple. He is brought, as it were, after his journey in the spirit, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh towards the north (Revised Version). This is identified in ver. 5 with the \"gate of the altar.\" It may probably also be identified with the \"upper gate\" of Ezekiel 9:2; the \"high gate\" of Jeremiah 20:2; the \"higher gate\" of 2 Kings 15:35, built by Jotham; the \"new gate\" of Jeremiah 36:10. Obviously it was one of the most conspicuous portions of the temple, where the people gathered in large numbers. And here the prophet sees what he calls the image of jealousy. The words that follow probably give his explanation of the strange phrase, not found elsewhere, though it might naturally be suggested by Deuteronomy 32:16, 21; Psalm 78:58. What this image was we can only conjecture. The word for \"image\" is a rare one, and is found only here and in Deuteronomy 4:16; 2 Chronicles 33:7, 15. It may have been the Asherah (the \"grove\" of the Authorized Version), or conical stone, such as Manasseh had made and placed, with an altar dedicated to it, in the house of the Lord (2 Kings 21:3; 2 Chronicles 33:3), or one of Baal, or of Ashtaroth, or even of Tammuz (see ver. 14). As the word \"grove\" does not occur in Ezekiel, it may be sufficient to state that the Ashera was a pillar symbolical either of a goddess of the same name, or, as some think, of the Phoenician Astarte. The worship seems to have first become popular under Jezebel (1 Kings 18:19), and took deep root both in Israel and Judah. The cultus, as in 2 Kings 23:7, seems to have been connected with the foulest licence, like that of the Babylonian Mylitta (Herod., 1:199; Baruch 6:43). The work of Josiah had clearly had but a temporary success, and the people had gone back to the confluent polytheism of the reign of Manasseh. In such a state of things the worst was possible. For recent discussions on the Ashera, see Kuenen. 'Relig. Isr.' (Eng. transl.), 1:88; Schrader; Robertson Smith, 'Relig. of Semites,' p. 172; and T.K. Cheyne, in the Academy of December 14, 1889.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - And, behold, etc. In appalling contrast with that \"image of jealousy,\" Ezekiel saw what he had not seen, as he first became conscious that he was in the court of the temple - the vision of the Divine glory, such as he had seen it on the banks of Chebar (Ezekiel 1:4-28). He was to look first on this picture and then on that, and the guilt of Judah was measured by that contrast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north.

The temple was already as a God-deserted shrine. His return to it now was but the coming of the Judge and the Destroyer. We are reminded of the Μεταβαίνωμεν ἔντευθεν, (\"Let us depart hence\"), which was heard in the darkness of the night before the later destruction of Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.' 6:05.3) Bad begins, but worse remains behind. The prophet is led onward as through the successive stages of an inferno of idolatries.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - To the door of the court. What follows suggests that the prophet was led to the gate that opened from the inner to the outer court. This gas surrounded by chambers or cells (Jeremiah 35:4). The term for \"wall\" (kir) is that specially used for the wall which encloses a whole group of buildings (Numbers 35:4). Behold a hole in the wall. The fact was clearly significant. The worship here was more clandestine than that of the \"image of jealousy.\" We are not warranted, perhaps, in insisting on minute consistency in the world of visions, but the question naturally arises - How did the worshippers enter the chamber if Ezekiel had to enlarge the hole in the wall in order to get in? We may surmise that the entrance from the temple court had been blocked up all but entirely in the days of Josiah, that the idolaters now entered it from without or through some other chamber, while Ezekiel thinks of himself as coming upon them like a spy in the dim distance of the covered passage through which he made his way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Every form of creeping things. The words obviously paint the theriomorphic worship of Egypt, the scarabseus probably being prominent. The alliance between Jehoiakim and Pharaoh (2 Kings 24:33-35), and which Zedekiah was endeavouring to renew, would naturally bring about a revival of that cultus. Small chambers in rock or tomb filled with such pictured symbols were specially characteristic of it (Gosse, 'Monuments of Egypt,' p. 6; 'Ammian. Marcellin.,' 22:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Seventy men, etc. The number was probably chosen with reference to the \"elders\" who had seen the Divine glory in Exodus 24:9, 10. The Sanhedrin, or council of seventy, did not exist till after the Captivity. The number can scarcely have been accidental, and may imply that the elders were formally representative. Another Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, appears in Jeremiah 35:3; yet another, the son of Azur, in Ezekiel 11:1. If the Shaphan mentioned is the scribe, the son of Azaliah, under Josiah (2 Kings 22:3), the father of Ahikam (2 Kings 22:12), of Elasah (Jeremiah 29:3), and of Gemariah (Jeremiah 36:10, 11, 12), and the grandfather of Gedaliah (Jeremiah 39:14, et al.), all of whom were prominent in the reform movement under Josiah, or as friends of Jeremiah, and no other Shaphan appears in history, the fact that one of his sons is the leader of the idolatrous company must have had for Ezekiel a specially painful significance. He could scarcely have forgotten the meaning of his name, \"The Lord is listening,\" and probably refers to it in ver. 12. As the climax of this chamber of horrors, the seventy elders were all acting as priests, and were offering to their pictured idols the incense which none but the sons of Aaron had a right to use, and which they offered to Jehovah only.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12 - Every man, etc. And this, after all, was but a sample of the prevalence of the Egyptian influence. Other elders had, in the dark, a like adytum, a like chamber of imagery, like the Latin lararium, filled. with a like cloud of incense. And though the name of the leader of the band might have warned them that the Lord was listening, they boasted, in their blindness, that Jehovah did not see them; he had forsaken the temple, and had fiche elsewhere. They thought of Jehovah as of a local deity who had abdicated. They were free to do as they liked without fear. The words are worth noting further as the first of a series of popular half proverbs, in which the thoughts of the people clothed themselves (see Ezekiel 11:3; Ezekiel 12:22; Ezekiel 18:2, 19; Ezekiel 33:10; Ezekiel 37:11). All these imply some personal knowledge of what was passing in Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Behold, there sat women wailing for Tammuz. The point of view is probably the same as that of ver. 3, but the women were apparently in the outer porch of it, as he has to be brought to the gate in order to see them. We are led to note two things:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the general prominence of women in the later idolatry of Judah;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the specific character of the Tammuz worship.NEWLINENEWLINEUnderNEWLINENEWLINE(1) we have the women who wove hangings for the Ashera (2 Kings 23:7), those who had burnt incense to other gods, especially to the queen of heaven (Jeremiah 44:9, 15-19), probably, i.e., to Ashtaroth.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The name Tammuz does not meet us elsewhere in the Old Testament. All interpreters, however, agree that it answers to the Adonis of Greek mythology. So Jerome translates it, and expressly states (in loc.) that what Ezekiel saw corresponded to the Adonis festivals. It may be enough to state, without going into the details of the story, that Adonis, the beautiful youth beloved of Aphrodite, was slain by a wild boar; that after his death he was allowed to spend six months of each year with her, while the other was passed with Persephone in Hades. The cultus thus became the symbol of the annual decay and revival of nature; but the legend rather than the inner meaning was in the thoughts of the worshippers. The emotions of women poured themselves out in lamentations over the waxen image of the beautiful dead youth who had perished in his prime, and in orgiastic joy over his return to life. Milton, deriving his knowledge, probably, from Selden's 'De Diis Syris,' has painted the whole atone in words which may well be quoted -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Thammuz next came behind,NEWLINEWhose annual wound in Lebanon alluredNEWLINEThe Syrian damsels to lament his fateNEWLINEIn amorous ditties all a summer's day;NEWLINEWhile smooth Adonis from his native rockNEWLINERan purple to the sea, supposed with bloodNEWLINEOf Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-taleNEWLINEInfected Sion's daughters with like heat;NEWLINEWhose wanton passions in the sacred porchNEWLINEEzekiel saw, when, by the vision led,NEWLINEHis eyes surveyed the dark idolatriesNEWLINEOf alienated Judah.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Par. Lost,' 1:446, etc.) The chief centre of the Tammuz-Adonis worship was Byblos, in Syria. but it spread widely over the shores of the Mediterranean and was fashionable both in Alexandria and Athens. One of the practices of the festival, that of planting flowers in vases for forced cultivation, has been perpetuated by Plato's allusion to \"the gardens of Adonis\" as the type of transitoriness ('Phaedr.' p. 376, b). Cheyne, following Lagarde, finds a reference to the cultus in Isaiah 17:10; Isaiah 65:3: 66:17. The festival of Ishtar and Tammuz (or Tam-zi) at Babylon presented a marked parallel. Adonis is, with hardly a doubt, identical with the Hebrew Adonai (equivalent to \"Lord\"). Tammuz has been explained as meaning \"victorious,\" or \"disappearance,\" or \"burning;\" but all etymologies are conjectural. Lastly, it is not without interest to noteNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that when Jerome wrote, the Cave of the Nativity at Bethlehem was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz ('Ep. ad Paul.'); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the later Jewish calendar included the month of Tammuz, which corresponded to July. The festival seems to have been celebrated at the summer solstice. The time of Ezekiel's vision was in the sixth month, sc. about the time of the autumnal equinox (see 'Dict. Bible,' art. \"Tammuz\"). Mr. Baring-Gould, treating the legend as a solar myth, finds the old Phoenician deity represented in the \"St. George of Merrie England\" ('Curious Myths,' pp. 277-316). An exhaustive monograph, \"Tammuz Adonis,\" has been published by Liebrecht, in his 'Zur Volkskunde' (1879), reprinted from the Zeitschrift Deutschen Morgen-Gesellschaft, vol. 17. pp. 397, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He brought me into the inner court. The last and the worst form of desecration follows. It was the \"inner court\" (Joel 2:17) which, after the exile, was entered only by the priests. During the monarchy, however, it seems to have been accessible to kings and other persons of importance, as in the case of Solomon (1 Kings 8:22, 64; 1 Kings 9:25) in the revolution against Athaliah (2 Kings 11:4-15), and Hezekiah (2 Kings 19:14), and Josiah (2 Kings 23:2). Ezekiel does not say that the men whom he saw were priests, though the number twenty-five suggests that they were taking the place of the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood (1 Chronicles 24:4-19), and so symbolized the whole order of the priesthood as the seventy elders represented the laity. In 2 Chronicles 36:14 the chief of the priests is spoken of as having been prominent in \"polluting the house of the Lord.\" They were seen turning their backs to the temple of Jehovah, i.e. the sanctuary. The very act was symbolical of their apostasy (2 Chronicles 29:6; Isaiah 1:4; Jeremiah 7:24). And they did this in order that they might look to the east and worship the rising sun. That, and not the temple (Daniel 6:10), was the Kiblah of their adoration. The sun worship here appears to have had a Persian character, as being offered to the sun itself, and not to Baal, as a solar god. Of such a worship we have traces in Deuteronomy 4:19; Deuteronomy 17:3; Job 31:26; 2 Kings 23:5, 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For returned read, with the Revised Version, turned again. The wind seems chosen with special reference to the attitude of the idol worshippers. It may be noted that even here the prophet speaks not only of the idolatry of Judah, but of its violence also, as bringing down the judgments of Jehovah. Lo, they put the branch to their nose. The opening word expresses the prophet's burning indignation. The act described probably finds its best explanation in the Persian ritual of the Avesta. When men prayed to the sun, they held in their left hands a bouquet of palm, pomegranate, and tamarisk twigs, while the priests for the same purpose held a veil before their mouth (Spiegel, 'Iran. Alterth.,' 3:571, 572, in Smend), so that the bright rays of the sun might not be polluted by human breath. And this was done in the very temple of Jehovah by those who were polluting the whole land by their violence. The LXX. gives, as an explanation, ὡς μυκτηρίζοντες, as though the act was one of scornful pride (comp. Isaiah 65:5), the sign of a temper like that of the Pharisee as he looked upon the publican (Luke 18:11). Lightfoot takes the \"nose\" as the symbol of anger, and looks on the phrase as proverbial: \"They add the twig to their anger, fuel to the fire;\" but this has little to commend it. The word for \"branch\" is used in Ezekiel 15:2 and Numbers 13:23 for a vine branch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The verse serves as a transition to ch. 9. The unpitying aspect of the Divine judgments is again prominent. Such sins deserved, and could only be expiated by, the judgments to which we now pass.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ezek.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - He cried, etc. The voice comes, as before, from the human form, seen as a theophany, in the midst of the Divine glory. Cause them that have charge over the city. The noun is an abstract plural, commonly rendered \"visitation\" (Isaiah 10:3; Jeremiah 11:23, and elsewhere). Here, however, it clearly stands for persons (just as we use \"the watch\" for \"the watchmen\"), and is so used in Isaiah 60:17; 2 Kings 11:18 (comp. Ezekiel 44:11). The persons addressed are called \"men,\" but they are clearly thought of as superhuman; like the angels who came to Sodom (Genesis 19:1); like the angel with the drawn sword in 2 Samuel 24:16; 1 Chronicles 21:16. His destroying weapon. The word clearly implies something different from a sword, but corresponds in its vagueness to the Hebrew. In ver. 2 the Hebrew for \"slaughter weapon\" implies an instrument for crashing into fragments, probably an axe or mace. A cognate word in Jeremiah 51:20 is translated \"battle axe,\" and the LXX. gives that meaning here, as also does the margin of the Revised Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Behold, six men, etc. The man clothed with linen brings the number up to the sacred number seven, as in Zechariah 4:10; Revelation 1:16, 20; Revelation 15:6. He is over them rather than among them, and answers to the scribe who appears so frequently in Assyrian sculptures, as the secretary who counts the prisoners that have been taken in battle. They come from the north, the region from which the vision of Ezekiel 1:4 had come, in which, in the nearer vision of Ezekiel 8:4, the prophet had seen the same glorious presence. They appear, i.e., as issuing from the Divine presence to do their work of judgment. Possibly. as in Jeremiah 1, there may be an allusive reference to the fact that the Chaldeans, as the actual instruments of their judgment, came from the same region. The gate in question was built by Jotham (2 Kings 15:35). The captain of the band is arrayed in the \"white linen\" of the hosts of heaven and of the priests on earth (ποδήρης in the LXX.; comp. Leviticus 6:10; Leviticus 16:4; Ezekiel 44:17; Daniel 10:5; Daniel 12:6). A writer's inkhorn. Through all the changes of Eastern life this has been the outward sign of the scribe's office. Here it is obviously connected with the oft-recurring thought of the books of life and death in the chancery of heaven (Exodus 32:32; Psalm 69:28; Psalm 139:16; Isaiah 4:3; Daniel 12:1; Philippians 4:3). It was to be the work of this scribe (ver. 4) to mark such as were for death to death, such as were for life to life. The LXX., misunderstanding the Hebrew, or following a different text, gives, not \"a writer's inkhorn,\" but \"a girdle of sapphire.\" With all the precision of one who knew every inch of the temple courts, the priest-prophet sees the visitants take their station beside the brazen altar, probably, as they came from the north, on the north side of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Was gone up; better, went up. The prophet saw the process as well as the result. The \"glory of the Lord\" which he bad seen (Ezekiel 8:4) by the northern gate rose from its cherub throne (we note the use of the singular to express the unity of the fourfold form), as if to direct the action of his ministers, to the threshold of the \"house.\" This may be connected also with the thought that the normal abiding place of the presence of the Lord had been \"between the cherubim\" (Psalm 80:1) of the mercy seat, but that thought seems in the present instance to be in the background, and I adopt the former interpretation as preferable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Set a mark upon the foreheads, etc. The command reminds us of that given to the destroying angel in Exodus 12:13, and has its earlier and later analogues in the mark set upon Cain (Genesis 4:15), and in the \"sealing\" of the servants of God in Revelation 7:3. Here, as in the last example, the mark is set, not on the lintels of the doorposts, but upon the \"foreheads\" of the men. And the mark is the letter tau, in old Hebrew, that of a cross + , and like the \"mark\" of mediaeval and (in the case of the illiterate) of modern usage, seems to have been used as a signature, and is rightly so translated in the Revised Version of Job 31:35. Jewish writers have accounted for its being thus used, eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) from its being the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and thus denoting completeness, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) from its being the first letter of the word thorah (Law); orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) from its standing in the same position in the Hebrew word for \"thou shalt live.\" Christian writers (Origen, in loc.; Tertullian, 'Adv. Marcion,' 3:22) have not unnaturally seen in it a quasi-prophetic reference to the sign of the cross as used by Christians, and it is possible that the use of that sign in baptism may have originated in this passage. That was to be the sign of the elect of God in the midst of a world lying in wickedness. Possibly in older as in later forms of idolatry (as eg. in the cultus of Mithras, Vishnu, Sehiva), the votaries of this or that deity may have been distinguished by some outward note of this kind; but of this, though suggested by Currey, I do not find any evidence. It is clear, however, that there could be no anticipation of the Christian symbolism in the minds of Ezeldel or of his hearers. The \"mark\" was to be placed on all who were still faithful to the worship of their fathers, though they could show their faithfulness only by lamentation of the national apostasy. Such, of course, were Jeremiah, and Baruch, and Ahikam, and Shaphan, and Gedaliah, and others, and such as these Ezekiel may have had present in his thoughts. Against all others (ver. 5) they were sent forth with unsparing severity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSlay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Begin at my sanctuary, etc. It was fitting that the spot in which guilt had culminated should be the starting point of punishment. There seems something like a reference to this command in 1 Peter 4:17. In each case judgment \"begins at the house of God.\" So the dread work began with the ancient men, or elders, of the same class, i.e., if not the same persons, as those in Ezekiel 8:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Defile the house, etc. What Ezekiel saw in vision was, we may well believe, fulfilled literally when the city was taken by the Chaldeans. The pollution of the temple by the bleeding corpses of the idolatrous worshippers was a fitting retribution for the worship with which they had polluted it (comp. Ezekiel 6:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I fell upon my face, etc. The ministers of vengeance and the prophet were left in the courts of the temple alone. His human, national sympathies led him, as they led Moses (Numbers 11:2; Numbers 14:19) and St. Paul (Romans 9:1-3) to undertake the work of intercession. With the words which had been the keynote of Isaiah's prophecies, probably present to his thoughts (Isaiah 37:32, et al.), he asks whether Jehovah will indeed destroy all that remnant of Israel (comp. Ezekiel 11:13) who might be as the germ of hope for the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then said he unto me. The answer holds out but little comfort. The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah (we note the coupling of the names though Judah only was the immediate subject of the vision, as if his prayer had gone up for the whole body of the twelve tribes) was immeasurably great. Not idolatry only, but its natural fruits, bloodshed and oppression, had eaten into the life of the nation (comp. Ezekiel 7:11, 12; Ezekiel 8:17; Ezekiel 22:25). And these evils had their root in the practical atheism of the denials which had been already uttered in Ezekiel 8:12. and which are here reproduced. The unpitying aspect of God's judgments is, for the present, dominant, and the work must be thorough. One notes how the despair of the prophet leads him to forget those who were to have the mark upon their foreheads, who were indeed the true \"remnant.\" Like Elijah, he does not know of any such (1 Kings 19:10); like Jeremiah, he searches through the streets of Jerusalem, and cannot find one righteous man (Jeremiah 5:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTEzekiel9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And, behold, etc. The speaker in the previous verses had been none other than the Presence which remained upon the cherubic lotto, while the seven ministers did their work. The captain of the seven now returns to report, as an officer to his king, that the work has been accomplished.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
