{"Mark.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Instead of the words, into the coasts of Judea by the farther side of Jordan, the passage, by a change of reading from διὰ τοῦ to καὶ. He will run thus: into the coasts (borders) of Judaea and beyond Jordan. Our Lord was now on his last progress towards Jerusalem. It would appear from St. Luke (Luke 9:51) that in the earlier part of his journey he touched the frontier of Samaria. Putting the accounts together, we conclude that, being refused by the Samaritans, he passed eastwards along their frontier, having Galilee on his left, and Samaria on his right; and then crossed the Jordan, perhaps at Scythopolis, where was a bridge, and so entered Peraea. As Judaea and Galilee both lay west of the Jordan, this route above described would be literally coming \"to the borders of Judaea and beyond Jordan.\" Again multitudes flocked together to him, and again he taught them. St. Matthew (Matthew 21:1) says that \"he healed them.\" His miracles of healing and his teaching went hand in hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And there came unto him Pharisees - the article should be omitted - and asked him - they came forward before the people, and publicly questioned him - Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? St. Matthew (Matthew 21:3) adds to the question the words, \"for every cause.\" There were causes for which it was lawful. They put this question to our Lord, tempting him; of course with an evil intent. This question about divorce was one which was much agitated in the time of our Lord. In the century before Christ, a learned rabbi, named Hillel, a native of Babylon, who afterwards came to Jerusalem, studied the Law with great success, and became the head of the chief school in that city. One of his disciples, named Shammai, separated from his master, and set up another school; so that in the time of our Lord the scribes and doctors of the Law were ranged in two parties, namely, the followers of Hillel, the most influential; and the followers of Shammai. These two schools differed widely on the subject of divorce. The followers of Shammai only permitted divorce in the case of moral defilement, while the followers of Hillel placed the matter entirely in the power of the husband. The object, therefore, of this artful question was to entrap our Lord, and to bring him into collision with one or other of these two opposing parties. For if he had said that it was not lawful for a man to put away his wife, he would have exposed himself to the hostility of many of the wealthy classes, who put away their wives for any cause. But if he had allowed the lawfulness of divorce at all, they would have found fault with his doctrine as imperfect and carnal, although he professed to be a spiritual Teacher of a perfect system, sent down from heaven.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you? They professed much reverence for Moses; he therefore appeals to their great lawgiver. And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. If we now turn to St. Matthew (Matthew 21:4, 5). He we shall find that our Lord then appeals to the original institution of marriage. \"Have ye not read, that he which made them from the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh? So that they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.\" He thus reminds them that marriage is a Divine institution; that as Adam and Eve were united by him in a union which was indissoluble, therefore he intended that the marriage bond should remain ever, so that the wife ought never to be separated from her husband, since she becomes by marriage a very part of her husband. To this purpose St. Augustine says ('City of God,' bk. 14:22). He \"It was not of the spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the rational soul which rules and the irrational desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme, and the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind and the sense of the body; but plainly of the matrimonial union, by which the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when asked whether it were lawful for any cause to put away one's wife, answered as in St. Matthew (Matthew 21:4, 5). It is certain, then, that from the first men were created as we see and know them to be now, of two sexes - male and female - and that they are called one, either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of the origin of the woman, who was created from out of the side of the man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - St. Matthew appears to give the more full account, of which St. Mark's is an abbreviation. If we suppose the scribes here to interpose their question, \"Why then did Moses permit a bill of divorcement?\" t he two narratives fit exactly. Our Lord here answers their question, For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. He permitted (not commanded) them to put away their wives, lest dislike might turn to hatred. From the beginning God joined them in one indissoluble bend; but man's nature having become corrupt through sin, that sin changed and corrupted the institution, and so was the occasion of bills of divorcement, and polygamy. The Law of Moses put some restraint upon the freedom with which men had till then put away their wives; for thenceforth, a divorce could not take place until some legal steps had been taken, and a regular instrument had been drawn up; and this delay might often be the means of preventing a divorce which might otherwise have been effected in a moment of passion. Thus this legislation was adapted to the imperfect moral condition of the people, who were as yet quite unprepared for a higher moral code.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The discussion with the Pharisees, related in the previous verses, had taken place in public. But now in the house, and in private, the disciples asked him again of this matter; so that what follows seems here to have been said to them privately. But it would appear from St. Matthew (Matthew 21:8) that our Lord had already said this in public; so that here he proclaims a new law, or rather affirms the sanctions of the primitive institution, abrogating the \"bill of divorcement\" excepting in the one case of fornication, and restoring the rite of marriage to its primaeval and indissoluble character.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Committeth adultery against her (μοιχᾶται ἐπ αὐτήν). This must surely mean the wife that has been put away. The adultery is against her, against her rights and interests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This verse should be read thus: And if she herself shall put away her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery καὶ ἐὰν αὐτὴ ἀπολύσασα τὸν ἄνδρα αὑτῆς γαμήση ἄλλον μοιχᾶται. This reading is well supported. These words indicate that, according to our blessed Lord's teaching, wives and husbands have equal rights in reference to divorce; and so the Greek, according to the best authorities, is (γαμήση) \"shall marry,\" not (γαμηθῆ) \"shall be married.\" Josephus, however, makes it evident that in his time husband and wife had by no means equal rights in these matters ('Antiq.' 15:7, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - It is worthy of notice that this touching incident follows here, as well as in the parallel passage in St. Matthew (Matthew 21:13). He immediately after the discourse about the marriage bond. And they brought unto him (προσέφερον) - literally, were bringing - little children (παιδία) - St. Luke (Luke 18:15) calls them \"babes\" (βρέφη) - that he should touch them (ἵνα ἅψηται αὐτῶν). St. Luke has the same word (ἵνα ἅπτηται); but St. Matthew (Matthew 21:13) says \"that he should lay his hands on them and pray.\" The imposition of hands implies a formal benediction; the invoking of Divine grace upon them, that they might grow up into wise and holy men and women. Why did the disciples rebuke them? Perhaps because they thought it unworthy of so great a Prophet, whose business was rather that of instructing those of full age, to be spending his time upon little children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But when Jesus saw it (ἰδὼν δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς). The Greek shows that there was no interval between the acts of the parents and the disciples, and our Lord's seeing it. The parents were bringing the children, the disciples were rebuking them, Jesus was perceiving. He was much displeased (ἠγανάκτησε); literally, he was moved with indignation. His words imply eagerness and earnestness: Suffer the little children to come unto me; forbid them not. The copulative καὶ is not to be found in the best authorities. The omission adds force and vividness to the words. The simplicity, candour, and innocence of little children are very attractive. This narrative shows with what care children should be educated. For of such is the kingdom of God; that is, of such little children as these. The kingdom of heaven belongs in a peculiar manner to little children. We know for certain that little children who have been brought to Christ in Holy Baptism, if they die before they are old enough for moral accountableness, are undoubtedly saved. They pass at once into a nearer position to the throne. \"They are without fault before the throne of God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein. Observe the \"verily\" with which our Lord introduces these words. He here adds something which extends what he has just said to those who are, not literally, but figuratively, little children. We must first receive the kingdom into our affections before we can really enter into it. It is as though Christ said, \"It is not unworthy of my dignity to take little children into my arms and bless them, because by my benediction they become fit for the kingdom of heaven. And if you full-grown men would become fit for my kingdom, you must give up your ambitious aims and earthly contests, and imitate the simple unworldly ways of little children. The simplicity of the little child is the model and the rule for every one who desires, by the grace of Christ, to obtain the kingdom of heaven. Our Lord's whole action here is a great encouragement to the receiving of little children by Holy Baptism into covenant with him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And he took them in his arms, and blessed them, laying his hands upon them. This is considered the true order of the words, according to the best authorities. The word rendered \"taking in the arms\" (ἐναγκαλισάμενος) has already occurred in this Gospel at Mark 9:36 (where see the note). The description here is very graphic. Our Savior would first embrace the little child,. He folding it in his arms; then he would lay his right hand upon the child's head, and bless it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - This verse should be rendered, And as he was going forth (ἐκπορευομένου αὐτοῦ) - that is, just as he was leaving the house - there ran one to him, and kneeled to him, and asked him. St. Matthew (Matthew 21:20) says that he was \"a young man.\" St. Luke (Luke 18:18) that he was \"a ruler.\" He had apparently been waiting for our Lord, waylaying him, though with a good intention. He showed zeal - as soon as he saw Jesus he ran to him; and he showed reverence, for he kneeled down to him. He wanted advice from one whom he must have heard of as a celebrated Teacher; and he wanted this counsel as a matter of great interest to himself. Good Master. This would be the ordinary and courteous mode of accosting a person professing to be a teacher, so as to conciliate his attention and interest. What shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? It is as though he said, \"Rabbi, I know thee to be good, both as a man and as a teacher, and a prophet, well able to teach me perfectly those things which are really good, and which lead to blessedness hereafter. Tell me, therefore, What shall I do?\" St. Matthew (Matthew 21:17) says, \"What good thing (τί ἀγαθὸν ποιήσω) shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Why callest thou me good? According to the best authorities, the words in St. Matthew (Matthew 21:17) run thus: \"Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good.\" The word \"good\" is the pivot on which our Lord's answer turns, both in St. Matthew and here. The question is doubtless put to test the young ruler's faith. If, as may be supposed, the young man used the term, \"good Master,\" as a mere conventional expression, it was not the proper epithet to apply to our Lord, who at once transfers the praise and the goodness to God, that he might teach us to do the same. This ruler, by his mode of accosting our Lord, showed that he had not as yet a right faith in him - that he did not believe in his Godhead. Our Lord, therefore, desired to rouse him and lift him up to a higher faith. He seems to say to him, \"If you call me good, believe that I am God; for no one is good, intrinsically good, but God. God alone is essentially good, and wise, and powerful, and holy. It is from him that angels and men derive a few drops, or rather some faint adumbration, of his goodness. There is none essentially, entirely, absolutely good but one, that is, God. Therefore seek after him, love him, imitate him. He alone can satisfy your longing desires, as in this life with his grace, so in the life to come with his glory; yea, with himself. For in heaven he manifested himself as the supreme good, to be tasted and enjoyed by the blessed for ever.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - In St. Matthew (Matthew 21:17, etc.) the record of our Lord's conversation with the young ruler is more full; and it should be read side by side with the more condensed narrative of St. Mark. It will be observed that it is upon the commandments of the second table that our Lord here lays stress. For the love of God produces the love of our neighbor; and he who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Master, all those things have I observed from my youth (ἐφυλαξὰμην) literally, I kept, I guarded. St. Matthew adds here (Matthew 19:20). He \"What lack I yet?\" - \"What is still wanting in me, that I may inherit the life to come in its fullness of glory and bliss? You seem, good Master, as a heavenly Teacher, to set forth a higher and more excellent way than that pointed out by our scribes and Pharisees. Tell me what that way is. Tell me what! still lack; for I earnestly desire to go forward in the right way that leadeth to everlasting life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And Jesus looking upon him loved him. (ἐμβλέψας αὐτῶ ἠγάπησεν αὐτόν) This is another of St. Mark's graphic touches - an exquisite piece of word-painting, probably supplied to him by St. Peter. The words express most vividly an earnest, tender, searching look. They seem, if it may be said reverently, to combine the Divine penetration with human sympathy and compassion. The counsel of our Lord which follows was not a general command, but a particular precept, which the young ruler specially needed. One thing thou lackest. In St. Matthew (Matthew 19:21) the words are, \"If thou wouldest be perfect.\" But our Lord's words here, \"One thing thou lackest,\" fit in excellently with the young ruler's question given just before in St. Matthew, \"What lack I yet?\" showing a substantial unity in the narrative, with just that variety which we should expect in the account of the same incident given by two independent but equally trustworthy witnesses. The \"one thing thou lackest\" of St. Mark, and \"if thou writ be perfect of St. Matthew, both point to the same conclusion - that our Lord's object was to reveal this young man to himself. His stumbling-block was his wealth; and so our Savior at once pierces his besetting sin of covetousness. The precept was a special counsel to him; it directed him to do something which, as our Lord saw, was in his case necessary to his salvation. He could not follow Christ without parting with this sin, and with that which ministered to it. This was his particular spiritual difficulty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - But his countenance fell at the saying (ὁ δὲ στυγνάσας ἐπὶ τῳ λόγῳ). The same word is used in St. Matthew (Matthew 16:3) for a \"lowering,\" \"frowning sky\" (οὐρανὸς στυγνάζων). And he went away sorrowful (ἀπῆλθε λυπούμενος)- literally, for he was one that had (η΅ν γὰρ ἔχων) - great possessions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples (καὶ περιβλεψάμενος ὁ Ιησοῦς λέγει). St. Mark frequently uses this word περιβλέπω. Our Lord turned from the young man, who was now going away, and looked round about, no doubt with a sad and disappointed look, and said to his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! Why is this? Partly because the love of riches tempts men to heap them up, whether lawfully or unlawfully. Partly because the love of riches binds the soul to earth, so that it is less likely to think of Partly because riches are an incentive to pride and luxury and other sins. The heathen poet Ovid could speak of riches \"irritamenta malorum.\" Poverty and contempt of riches often open that heaven which wealth and covetousness close.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And the disciples were astonished (ἐθαμβοῦντο) - literally, were amazed at his words. The Greek word here implies wilderment. It is used again below at ver. 32. We find it also at Mark 1:27. This doctrine of our Lord was so new and strange to them. They had been accustomed to think little of the danger, and much of the advances of wealth. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children how hard is it for them that trust in riches enter into the kingdom of God! He the enduring expression of \"children\" (τέκνα). He and takes off somewhat of the edge of the seventy of the expression, by changing the form of it into the words,\" how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!\" There is some authority for omitting the words. \"for them that trot in riches;\" so to reduce the sentence to the simple form, \"How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!\" Such is the reading in the two great uncial manuscripts, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. But on the whole the balance of evidence is in favor of that which was adopted in the Authorized Version, and has been retained by the Revisers of 1881; and it is reasonable to believe that our Lord qualified the former expression, in order to relieve the minds of his amazed disciples.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - It is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, etc. This is a strong hyperbolic proverbial expression to represent anything that is very difficult to do. Dr. John Lightfoot, in his Hebrew exercitations upon St. Matthew's Gospel (vol. 2 p. 219). He quotes instances from the binical writings of a very similar phrase intended to represent something that is possible. For example, he quotes one rabbi disputing with another, who says, \"Perhaps thou art one of those who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a needle; that i,s, \"who speak things that are impossible.' St. Jerome says,\" It is not the absolute impossibility of the thing which is set forth, but the infrequency of it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And they were astonished exceedingly (περισσῶς ἐξεπλήσσοντο). saying among themselves - according to the best reading the words are, saying unto him (πρὸς αὐτόν) - Then who can be saved?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Jesus looking upon them (ἐμβλέψας δὲ αὐτοῖς). The Greek verb implies an earnest, intense looking upon them; evidently narrated by one who, like Peter, had watched his countenance. St. Chrysostom says that he looked on them in this way that he might mitigate and soothe the timid and anxious minds of his disciples. It is as though our Lord said, \"It is impossible for a rich man, embarrassed and entangled with his wealth, by his own natural strength to obtain salvation; because this is a supernatural blessing, which we cannot obtain without the like supernatural aids of grace. But with God all things are possible, because God is the Author and Source, as of nature, so of grace and glory. And he enables us, by his grace, to triumph over all the difficulties and hindrances of nature; so that rich men shall not be hindered by their riches; but, by being faithful in the unrighteous mammon, shall make it the means of their being received unto 'the eternal tabernacle.'\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. Peter began to say unto him. He had been thinking of himself and his companions, the other disciples.. He in reference to these last words of our Lord. It is probable that the sacrifice which Peter and the rest of the disciples had made when they became his followers, was small, compared with the sacrifice which our Lord demanded of the rich young ruler. Nevertheless they forsook their all, whatever it was. They had forsaken their boats and their nets. They had forsaken their means of subsistence. They had forsaken things which, though they were not much in themselves, were nevertheless such things as they would have desired to keep. Cornelins a Lapide says, \"Such things are forsaken by those who follow Christ, as are capable of being desired by those who do not follow him.\" St. Augustine says, \"St. Peter not only forsook what he had, but also what he desired to have. But who does not desire daily to increase what he has? That desire is cut off. Peter forsook the whole world, and he received in return the whole world. They were as those who had nothing, and yet were possessing all things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - St. Matthew (Matthew 19:28) here introduces the great promise, to be fulfilled in the regeneration, that is, at the second coming of Christ - at the second birth of the world to a new and glorious state. It may be that St. Matthew was guided to record it, inasmuch as his Gospel was written for Jews. Its omission by St. Mark and St. Luke may be explained by the fact that they were writing, the one to Romans, and the other to Gentiles generally. Omitting further notice here of this great promise recorded only by St. Matthew, St. Mark's words seem general, common to all faithful Christians. This leaving, of house, or brethren, or sisters, etc., might be rendered necessary from various causes. But they are all covered by that one expression, for my sake, and for the gospel's.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - But he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time (ἑκατονταπλασίονα). St. Luke (Luke 18:30) says (πολλαπλασίονα) \"manifold more\" - an indefinite increase, to show the greatness and multitude of the recompense. He who forsakes his own for the sake of Christ will find others, many in number, who will give him the love of brethren and sisters, with even greater affection; so that he will seem not to have lost or forsaken his own, but to have received them again with interest. For spiritual affections are far deeper than natural; and his love is stronger who burns with heavenly love which God has kindled, than he who is influenced by earthly love only, which only nature has planted. But in the fullest sense, he who forsakes these earthly things for the sake of Christ, receives instead, God himself. For to those who forsake all for him, he is himself father, brother, sister, and all things. So that he will have possessions far richer than what earth can supply; only with persecutions (μετὰ διωγμῶν). This is a very striking addition. Our Lord here includes \"persecutions\" in the number of the Christian's blessings. And no doubt there is a noble sense in which persecutions are really amongst the blessings of the believer. \"If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you\" (1 Peter 4:14). St. Peter, who must have had in his mind the \"with persecutions\" of our Lord when he wrote these words, here shows that the blessedness of the Christian when suffering persecution is this, that he has a special sense of the abiding presence of the Spirit of God, bringing with it the assurance of future glory. \"Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: far great is your reward in heaven.\" The words are also, of course, a warning to the disciples as to the persecutions that awaited them. And in the world to come eternal life. This is that splendid inheritance in which the blessed shall be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; and so shall possess not only the heaven and the earth, and all things that are in them, but even God himself, and all honor, all glory, all joy, not merely as occupiers, but as heirs for ever; as long as God himself shall be, who is himself \"the eternal God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut many that are first shall be last; and the last first.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. Most fitly does our Lord add this weighty sentence to what has just gone before. For thus he places himself, his grace, and his gospel in direct opposition to the corrupt teaching of the scribes and Pharisees. Perhaps the disciples thought within themselves, \"How can it come to pass that we, the poor, the unlearned, the despised, are to sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel, amongst whom are men far our superiors in station, in learning, and in authority, such as are the scribes and Pharisees, and that rich young ruler just mentioned.\" Our Lord here teaches them that the future will reveal great changes - that some who are first here will be last there, and some who seem last here will be first there. The disciples, and others like them, who, having forsaken all and followed Christ, seemed to be last in this world, will be first in the world to come - most dear to Christ, the King of Heaven, in their lives; most like to him in their zeal for his cause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - They were now going up from Jericho to Jerusalem, going up with Christ to his cross and his death. He went before them, eagerly leading the way for his timid disciples, who were now beginning to realize what was about to happen, and that he would be condemned and crucified. Therefore the evangelist adds, they were amazed (Greek, ἐθαμβοῦντο); the same word which is used at ver. 24. The words in the original, according to the best reading, make a distinction between the utter amazement of the disciples and the fear of the others who followed (οἱ δὲ ἀκολουθοῦντες ἐφοβοῦντο). St. Mark draws a distinction between the disciples, who would be following him, though at a little distance, and the mixed company, who were also following him, though at a greater distance. The whole scene is before us. Our blessed Lord, with an awful majesty on his countenance, and eager resolution in his manner, is pressing forwards to his cross. \"How am I straitened until it be accomplished!\" His disciples follow him, amazed and bewildered; and even the miscellaneous crowd, who no doubt gazed upon him with keen interest as the great \"Prophet that should come into the world,\" felt that something was going to happen, though they knew not what - some-thing very dreadful; and they too were afraid. In the case of the disciples, Bede says that the chief cause of their amazement was their own imminent fear of death. They were amazed that their Master should hasten forward with such alacrity to his cross, and they feared lest they too should have to suffer with him. He took again the twelve; and once more impressed upon them the dread realities which were awaiting him. They were still slow of apprehension; they required to be told again and again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And there come near unto him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying unto him, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee. St. Matthew (Luke 20:20) informs us that this request was made by Salome, \"the mother of Zebedee's children.\" The two accounts are readily reconciled if we consider that the request was made by Salome and her sons, and by her in their behalf. This request was made by them not long after they had heard our Lord's great promise that his apostles \"in the regeneration\" should \"sit upon thrones,\" judging the twelve tribes of Israel\" (Matthew 19:28). He and very soon after they had heard his repeated announcement of his sufferings and death. But the thought of the glory which was to follow swallowed up the thought of the suffering that was to precede it; and so these two disciples were emboldened at once to ask for prominent positions amongst the thrones. St. Chrysostom finds an excuse for the imperfection of their faith. He says, \"The mystery of the cross was not yet accomplished; nor yet was the grace of the Holy Spirit poured into their hearts. Wherefore, if you desire to know the strength of their faith, consider what they became after they had been endued with power from on high.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - It will be observed that in St. Matthew (Luke 20:20). He while Salome is represented as the person who makes the request, the answer is given, not to her, but to her sons. Ye know not what ye ask. Our Lord knew that the sons had spoken in the mother and by the mother. They knew not what they askedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) because his kingdom was spiritual and heavenly, not carnal and earthly, as they supposed;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) because they sought the glory before they had gained the victory;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) because perhaps they thought that this kingdom was given in right of natural relationship (they were his cousins); whereas it is not given save to those who deserve it and take it by force. Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? It is as though he said, \"It is by my cross and passion that I am to attain to the kingdom; therefore the same way must be trodden by you who seek the same end.\" Our Lord here describes his passion as his cup. The \"cup\" everywhere in Holy Scripture, as well as in profane writers, signifies a man's portion, which is determined for him by God, and sent to him. The figure is derived from the ancient custom at feasts, by which the ruler of the feast tempered the wine according to his own will, and appointed to each guest his own portion, which it was his duty to drink. Our Lord then proceeds to describe his passion, which he had already spoken of as his cup, as his baptism. He uses this image because he would be totally buried, immersed, so to speak, in his passion. But it seems probable that the idea of purification entered into this image. It was a baptism of fire into which he was plunged, and out of which he came forth victorious. The fire of his bitter passion and death tried him. It was his \"salting with fire.\" It pleased God thus to \"make the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings.\" Our Lord asks these ambitious disciples whether they could drink his cup of suffering, and be baptized with his fiery baptism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - James and John seem to have understood the meaning of the cup; and perhaps also of the baptism. They both of them drank the cup, though in different ways. St. James, preaching Christ more boldly and fervently, became an early martyr, having been slain by the sword of Herod (Acts 12:2). St. John also drank of this cup, and was baptized with this baptism, when, if we may trust the authority of Tertullian ('De Praescript.' c. 36.). He he was cast by order of Domitian into a caldron of boiling oil, before the Porta Latina at Rome, although the oil had no power to hurt him. Another legend states that he drank a cup of poison, and took no harm. On this account he is frequently represented with a cup in his hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared. The Arians gathered from this that our Lord was not of one substance with the Father. But this arose from a misunderstanding of the words. For the antithesis is not here between Christ and the Father; but between James and John on the one side ambitiously seeking the pre-eminence, and those on the ether side to whom it ought of right to be given. St. Jerome wisely says, \"Our Lord does not say, 'Ye shall not sit,' lest he should put to shame these two. Neither does he say, 'Ye shall sit,' lest the others should be envious. But by holding out the prize to all, he animates all to contend for it.\" Our Lord is also careful to point out that he who humbles himself shall be exalted. But Christ is the Giver, not indeed by way of favor to any one who asks, but according to the eternal and unalterable principles laid down by the Father. That Christ is the Giver is plain from St. Luke (Luke 22:29). \"I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John. How did they hear it? It is most likely that Salome and her two sons sought this favor secretly from Christ, lest they should excite the envy of the ethers. But they, the ten, must have noticed the approach of James and John with their mother to our Lord. They came in a formal manner, worshipping him first, and then making their request (see Matthew 20:20). The ten would naturally be desirous to know the nature of this interview; and when it was explained to them, they began to show indignation. Our Lord perceived that they were disputing; and he then called them and addressed the whole body. For he saw that they were all laboring under this disease of ambition; and he wished to apply the remedy at once to all, as we see in the words which follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - In these words our Lord does not find fault with that power or authority, whether civil or ecclesiastical, which is exercised by princes or bishops; for this is necessary in every state, and so is sanctioned by Divine and human law. What he condemns is the arbitrary and tyrannical exercise of such power, which the princes of the Gentiles were accustomed to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 43, 44. - In these words our Lord enjoins him who is raised above others to conduct himself modestly and humbly; so as not to lord it over those beneath him, but to consider for them and to consult their security and happiness, and so to conduct himself that he may appear to be rather their minister and servant than their lord; ever remembering the golden rule, \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even so do to them.\" At the same time, our Lord here teaches all alike, whether superiors or inferiors, by what way we should strive to reach heaven, so as to sit at the right or left hand of Christ in his kingdom, namely, by the way of humility. For those who are the lowliest and most humble here will be the greatest and most exalted there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - A ransom for many (λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν; from λύω. to loose, or set free). Not that Christ died only for the elect. For Christ died for all; and has obtained for all the means necessary and sufficient for their salvation. Yet the fruit of his death and his full salvation comes only to those who persevere to the end. When our Lord says that he came \"to give his life a ransom for many,\" he regards the vast multitude of those who are included within his purposes of mercy. He \"is the Savior of all men, specially of them that believe.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - And they come to Jericho. Jericho, situated in the midst of a fertile, well-watered country, celebrated for its palm trees, was situated about seventeen English miles east-north-east of Jerusalem, and about six miles from the nearest bend of the river Jordan. In the time of our Lord it was one of the most important cities next to Jerusalem. It is now known by the name of Richa or Ericha, and is almost deserted. The journey from the Jordan to Jericho is through a fiat country; but that from Jericho to Jerusalem is very hilly. It is supposed that it was upon the rocky heights overhanging this city that our Lord's temptation took place. Jericho derives its name, either from \"the moon,\" or from the fragrant edours of the \"balsam\" plant, which was extensively cultivated in the neighborhood. Its palm groves and balsam gardens were bestowed by Anthony upon Cleopatra, from whom Herod the Great purchased them. It was here that Herod the Great died. It is now one of the most filthy and neglected places in Palestine. To this place our Lord came; and St. Luke (18 and 19.) gives a full account of his reception there. St. Matthew speaks of two blind men; but he agrees with St. Mark in saying that the cure took place as he went out from Jericho. St. Luke mentions only one; but he places the cure at the time of our Lord's entrance into Jericho. How do we reconcile St. Mark's account of one only, specially named, Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus? St. Augustine says that there were two blind men; but that the one, better known, overshadowed the other. He also says that Bartimaeus was a well-known character, and that he was accustomed to sit by the wayside, not only blind, but as a beggar. It is of course possible that St. Luke may refer to another ease altogether. But on the other hand, with the exception that he mentions only one, and that he places the cure at the time of the entrance into Jericho, and not at the time of the departure, all the other circumstances are identical. May not this latter discrepancy be reconciled thus? - the blind man may have sought a cure from Christ at his first entrance into the city; but he may not have been able to be heard on account of the crowd. Or our Lord may have passed him by at first, in order to stimulate his faith and hope. So the day after, he may have placed himself at the gate of the city, close by where Christ would pass through; and there again he may have urged his request, and so obtained healing. Dr. John Lightfoot (p. 348) says that the careful description of Bartimaeus would seem to imply that his father may have been a person of some note. Dr. Lightfoot adds that it is possible that Timaeus, or \"Thimai,\" may be the same with Simais, blind, from the use of the letter thau from samech, common amongst the Chaldaeans; so that Bartimaeus might mean nothing more than \"blind son of a blind father.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace. They rebuked him, perhaps, out of reverence and regard for Christ, who might perhaps at that moment have been preaching to the people, and so might be disturbed by the blind man's loud and noisy appeal. But the rebuke of the crowd gave additional energy to his entreaties; and he cried out the more a great deal, that his voice might be heard above them all. He was in good earnest, and would not be restrained. A useful lesson is hem suggested to all. He who desires to serve God must overcome all earthly shame and fear; for, indeed, this unworthy feeling keeps back many from Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - And Jesus stood still (στὰς ὁ Ἰησοῦς) - literally, Jesus stood - and said, Call ye him. St. Jerome says that our Lord stood still on account of the man's infirmity. There were many walls in Jericho; there were rough places; there were rocks and precipices over which he might stumble. Therefore the Lord stood, where there was a plain path by which the blind man might approach him. The crowd show their, sympathy. There is something very genuine as well as touching in their words, Be of good cheer: rise, he calleth thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - And he, casting away his garment, rose - the word in the Greek is ἀναπηδήσας. literally, sprang to his feet - and came to Jesus. He cast away his \"garment,\" that is, the loose outer robe which covered his tunic. He was in haste, and desired to disengage himself from every ira-pediment, in his eagerness to approach Jesus. We seem here to have the description of a keen eye-witness, such as St. Peter would be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 51, 52. - Our Lord well knew what he wanted; but it was necessary that he and those around him should hear from the lips of the blind man the confession of his need, and of his faith in the power that was present to heal him. And the blind man said unto him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight. \"Rabboni,\" or \"Rabbuni,\" means literally, my Master. It was a more respectful mode of address than the more simple form \"Rabbi.\" This expression shows that Bartimaeus had yet much to learn as to the Divine character of our Lord. But his faith is accepted; and he showed that it was genuine as far as it went, by forthwith following Jesus in the way. There were six occasions on which our Lord is recorded to have healed the blind: St. Matthew (Matthew 9:27; Matthew 12:22; Matthew 21:14); St. Mark (Mark 8:24; Mark 10:46); St. John (John 9:1). St. Chrysostom says of Bartimaeus, that as before this gift of healing he showed perseverance, so after it he shewed gratitude.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark10:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Mark.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives. St. Matthew (Matthew 21:1) says, \"When they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage.\" St. Mark mentions the three places together, because Bethphage and Bethany, being near together, were also both of them close to Jerusalem. The distance from Jericho to Jerusalem (about seventeen miles) would involve a journey of about seven hours. The country between Jerusalem and Jericho is hilly, rugged, and desolate. It is from the height overhanging Bethany that the finest view of Jerusalem is gained. It appears from St. John (John 12:1) that our Lord on the preceding sabbath had supped, and probably passed the night, at Bethany; and that on the following day (answering to our Palm Sunday) he had come still nearer to Jerusalem, namely, to Bethphage; and from thence he sent two of his disciples for the ass and the colt. So his way to Jerusalem was from Bethany by Bethphage, the Mount of Olives, and the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The Valley of Jehoshaphat, through which flows the brook Kedron, lies close to Jerusalem. Bethphage literally means \"the house of green figs,\" as Bethany, lying a short distance west of it, means \"the house of dates.\" The date palm growing in the neighbeurhood would furnish the branches with which the multitude strewed the way on the occasion of our Lord's triumphal entry. He sendeth two of his disciples. Who were they? Bede thinks that they were Peter and Philip. Jansonius, with greater probability, thinks that they were Peter and John, because a little after this Christ sent these two to prepare for the Passover. But we know nothing certain on this point.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Go your way into the village that is over against you. The village over against them would most likely be Beth-phage, towards which they were then approaching. Straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat. St. Mark mentions only the colt. St. Matthew mentions the ass and the colt. But St. Mark singles out the colt as that which our Lord specially needed; the mother of the animal accompanying it as a sumpter. Animals which had never before been used were alone admissible for sacred purposes. We read in Numbers (Numbers 19:2) of \"the heifer on which never came yoke.\" Our Lord here beholds things absent and out of sight, as though they were present. So that he revealed this to his disciples by the gift of prophecy which his divinity added to his humanity. Here, therefore, is a manifest proof of his divinity. It was by the same Divine power that he revealed to Nathanael what had taken place under the fig tree.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither. The Greek, according to the best authorities here, is εὐθέως αὐτὸν ἀποστελλει πάλιν ῶδε: literally, straightway he sendeth it back hither again, The verb here in the present may represent the verb in the future, \"he will send it back.\" But the word \"again\" (πάλιν) is not quite so easily explained. There is strong authority for the insertion of this word, which necessarily changes the meaning of the sentence. Without the πάλιν, the sentence would actually mean that our Lord, by his Divine prescience, here tells his disciples that when the colt was demanded by them the owner would at once permit them to take it. But if the word πάλιν be inserted, it can only mean that this was a part of the message which our Lord directed his disciples to deliver as from himself, \"The Lord hath need of him; and he, the Lord, will forthwith send him back again.\" The passage is so interpreted by Origen, who twice introduces the adverb in his commentary on St. Matthew. The evidence of the oldest uncials is strongly in favor of this insertion. Our Lord was unwilling that the disciples should take away the colt if the owner objected, lie might have taken the animals away in his own supreme right, but he chose to accomplish his will by his providence, powerfully and yet gently; and, if the reading here be allowed, he further influenced them by the promise that their property should be returned to them. It was the will and purpose of Christ, who for these three years had gone about on foot, and traveled over the whole of Palestine in this way, to show himself at length the King of Judah, that is, the Messiah and Heir of David; and so he resolves to enter Jerusalem, the metropolis, the city of the great King, with royal dignity. But he will not be surrounded with the\" pomp and circumstance\" of an earthly monarch. He rides on an ass's colt, that he might show his kingdom to be of another kind, that is, spiritual and heavenly. And so he assumes a humble equipage, riding upon a colt, his only housings being the clothes of his disciples. And yet there was dignity as well as humility in his equipage. The ass of the East was, and is, a superior animal to that known amongst us. The judges and princes of Israel rode on \"white asses,\" and their sons on asses' colts. So our Lord rode upon an ass's colt; and there were no gleaming swords in his procession, or other signs of strife and bloodshed. But there were palm branches and garments spread all along his path - the evidences of devotion to him. So he came in gentleness, not that he might be feared on account of his power, but that he might be loved on account of his goodness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - By the door without, in a place where two ways met (ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀμφόδου) literally, in the open street.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Others cut down branches off the trees, etc. According to the best authorities, the words should be rendered, and others branches (or, leaves, for strewing), which thy had cut from the fields (ἄλλοι δὲ στοιβάδας κόψαντες ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν). The branches were cut in the fields; and the smaller, leafy portions of them, suitable for their purpose, were carried out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The word Hosanna literally means \"Oh, save!\" It may have been originally the cry of captives or rebels for mercy; and thus have passed into a general acclamation, expressive of joy and deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This verse should be read thus: Blessed be the kingdom that cometh, the kingdom of our father David - that is, the kingdom of Messiah, now coming, and about to be established - Hosanna in the highest; - that is, Hosanna in the highest realms of glory and blessedness, where salvation is perfected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - This visit to the temple is not mentioned by St. Matthew. It is an important addition to his narrative. The moment of our Lord's triumphant entry into Jerusalem was not the moment for the display of his indignation against the profaners of the temple. He was then surrounded by an enthusiastic and admiring multitude; so he contented himself on this occasion with looking round about upon all things (περιβλεψάμενος πάντα). His keen and searching eye saw at a glance all that was going on, and penetrated everything. But without any comment or action at that time, he went out unto Bethany (it was now eventide) with the twelve. No doubt the disciples, and especially Peter, saw what was involved in this visit of inspection, which prepared them for what took place on the morrow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered. This was, therefore, the day after Palm Sunday (as we call it) - on the Monday, the 11th day of the month Nisan, which, according to our computation, would be March 21. He hungered. This showed his humanity, which he was ever wont to do when he was about to display his Divine power. The fact that he hungered would lead us to the conclusion that he had not been spending the night in the house of Martha and Mary. It is far more likely that he had been in the open air during the previous night, fasting and praying.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon. St. Matthew (Matthew 21:19) says he saw \"one fig tree\" (μὶαν συκῆν), and therefore more conspicuous. Fig trees were no doubt plentiful in the neighborhood of Bethphage, \"the house of figs.\" Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 418) says that \"Mount Olivet is still sprinkled with fig trees.\" This fig tree had leaves, but no fruit; for it was not the season of figs (ὁ γὰρ καιρὸς οὐκ ῆν σύκων). Other trees would all be bare at this early season, but the fig trees would be putting forth their broad green leaves. It is possible that this tree, standing by itself as it would seem, was more forward than the other fig trees around. It was seen \"from afar,\" and therefore it must have had the full benefit of the sun. Our Lord says (St. Luke 21:29), \"Behold the fig tree, and all the trees: when they now shoot forth, ye see it, and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh.\" He puts the fig tree first, as being of its own nature the most forward to put forth its buds. But then it is peculiar to the fig tree that its fruit begins to appear before its leaves. It was, therefore, a natural supposition that on this tree, with its leaves fully developed, there might be found at least some ripened fruit. Our Lord, therefore, approaches the tree in his hunger, with the expectation of finding fruit. But as he draws near to it, and realizes the fact that the tree, though full of leaf, is absolutely fruitless, he forgets his natural hunger in the thought of the spiritual figure which this tree began to present to his mind. The accident of his hunger as a man, brought him into contact with a great parable of spiritual things, presented to him as God; and as he approached this fig tree full of leaf, but destitute of fruit, there stood before him the striking but awful image of the Jewish nation, having indeed the leaves of a great profession, but yielding no fruit. The leaves of this fig tree deceived the passer-by, who, from seeing them, would naturally expect the fruit. And so the fig tree was cursed, not for being barren, but for being false. When our Lord, being hungry, sought figs on the fig tree, he signified that he hungered after something which he did not find. The Jews were this unprofitable fig tree, full of the leaves of profession, but fruitless. Our Lord never did anything without reason; and, therefore, when he seemed to do anything without reason, he was setting forth in a figure some great reality. Nothing but his Divine yearning after the Jewish people, his spiritual hunger for their salvation, can explain this typical action with regard to the fig tree, and indeed he whole mystery of his life and death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever (εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα). These words, in their application to the Jewish nation, have a merciful limitation - a limitation which lies in the original words rendered \"for ever,\" which literally mean for the age. \"No man eat fruit of thee henceforward, for the age;\" until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. A day will doubtless come when Israel, which now says, \"I am a dry tree,\" shall accept the words of its true Lord, \"From me is thy fruit found,\" and shall be clothed with the richest fruits of all trees. (See Trench on the Miracles). St. Matthew (Matthew 21:19) tells us that \"immediately the fig tree withered away.\" \"Straightway a shivering fear and trembling passed through its leaves, as though it was at once struck to the heart by the malediction of its Creator.\" Our Lord's disciples heard his words; but they appear not to have noticed the immediate effect of them upon the tree. It was not until the next day that they observed what had happened. This miracle would show his disciples how soon he could have withered his enemies, who were about to crucify him; but he waited with long-suffering for their salvation, by repentance and faith in him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple. Not the holy place, nor the holy of holies (into which the high priest might alone enter), but into the temple court; for into that the people went to pray, and to witness the sacrifices which were being offered before the holy place; for this court was, so to speak, the temple of the people. Our Lord was not a Levitical priest, because he was not sprung of Levi and Aaron. Therefore he could not enter the holy place, but only the outer court of the temple. And began to cast out (ἐκβάλλειν) - it was a forcible expulsion - them that sold and them that bought in the temple. There were two occasions on which our Lord thus purged the temple - one at the beginning of his public ministry, and the other at the end of it, four days before his death. There was a regular market in the outer court,' the court of the Gentiles, belonging to the family of the high priest. The booths of this market are mentioned in the rabbinical writings as the booths of the son of Hanan, or Annas. But this market is never mentioned in the Old Testament. It seems to have sprung up after the Captivity. Our Lord adopted these strong measuresNEWLINENEWLINE(1) because the temple courts were not the proper places for merchandise, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because these transactions were often dishonest, on account of the avarice and covetousness of the priests. The priests, either themselves or by their families, sold oxen and sheep and doves to those who had need to offer them in the temple. These animals were, of course, needed for sacrifices; and there was good reason why they should be ready at hand for those who came up to worship. But the sin of the priests lay in permitting this buying and selling to go on within the sacred precincts, and in trading dishonestly. There were other things needed for the sacrifices, such as wine, and salt, and oil. Then there were also the money-changers (κολλυβιστής, from κόλλυβος, a small coin) - those who exchanged large coins for smaller, or foreign money for the half-shekel. Every Israelite, whether rich or poor, was required to give the half-shekel, neither less nor more. So when money had to be exchanged, an allowance or premium was required by the money-changer. Doves or pigeons were required on various occasions for offerings, chiefly by the poor, who could not afford more costly offerings. From these also the priests had their gain. The seats of them that sold the doves. These birds were often sold by women, who were provided with seats.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple. It was a great temptation to make the temple, at least the great court of the Gentiles, a thoroughfare. It was so extensive that a long and tedious circuit would be avoided, in going from one part of the city to another, by passing through it. To those, for example, who were passing from the sheep market, Bethesda, into the upper part of the city, the shortest cut was through this court and by Solomon's Porch. The distance would be greatly increased if they went round it. So the priests permitted servants and laborers, laden with anything, to take this shorter way through the great court of the temple. But our Lord hindered them, forbidding them with the voice of one that had authority, and restraining them with his hand, and compelling them to go back. He would have the whole of his Father's House regarded as sacred.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations (πᾶσι τοῖς ἔθνεσιν). St. Mark, writing for Gentiles, assures them that the God of the Jews is the God of all the nations; and that the court of the Gentiles, which was then so profaned, was a constituent part of his house of prayer. St. Jerome notes Christ's action in driving out the profaners of the temple as a great proof of his Divine power, that he alone should have been able to cast out so great a multitude. He says, \"A fiery splendor flashed from his eyes, and the majesty of Deity shone in his countenance.\" The words, \"My house shall be called the house of prayer,\" are a quotation from Isaiah 56:7; and it is a remarkable coincidence that in Ver. 11 of that chapter the rulers of the people are described as looking \"every one for his gain from his quarter.\" A den of thieves (σπήλαιον ληστῶν); this should be rendered, a den of robbers. The Greek word for \"thief\" is κλέπτης, not ληστής. The two terms are carefully distinguished in St. John (John 10:1), \"the same is a thief (κλέπτης) and a robber (λῃστής).\" These priests, wholly intent upon gain, by various fraudulent acts plundered strangers and the poor, who came purchase offerings for the worship of God. Observe that the temple is called the house of God, not because he dwells in it in any corporeal sense, for \"he dwelleth not in temples made with hands,\" but because the temple is the place set apart for the worship of God, in which he specially gives ear to the prayers of his people, and in which he specially promises his spiritual presence. Hence we learn what reverence is due to the houses of God; so that, as the master of a house resents any insult offered to his house as an insult to himself, so Christ reckons any wilful dishonor done to his house as a wrong and insult to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And the chief priests and the scribes - this is the right order of the words - heard it (ἤκουσαν), and sought (ἐζήτουν) - began to seek, or were seeking (imperfect) - how they might destroy him (ἀπολέσουσιν). They were seeking how they might, not only put him to death, but \"utterly destroy him,\" stamp out his name and influence as a great spiritual energy in the world. This action of his raised them to the highest pitch of fury and indignation. Their authority and their interests were attacked. But the people still acknowledged his power; and the scribes and Pharisees feared the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when even was come, he went out of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And when even was come; literally, and whenever (ὅταν) evening came; that is, every evening. During these last days before his crucifixion, he remained in Jerusalem during the day, and went back to Bethany at night. St. Matthew says (Matthew 21:17), speaking of one of these days, \"And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.\" So true it was that \"he came unto his own, and his own received him not.\" No one in that city, which he loved so well, offered to receive him. The end was drawing near. But the intercourse with Martha and Mary must have been soothing to him; and Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. They had returned the evening before, probably after sunset, to Bethany; and so, in the twilight, had not noticed the withered tree. St. Matthew gathers the whole account of the fig tree into one notice. St. Mark disposes of the facts in their chronological order. It was on the Monday morning, the day after the triumphant entry, and when they were on their way to Jerusalem, that our Lord cursed the fig tree. Thence he passed on at once into Jerusalem, and drove out the profaners of the temple, and taught the people. In the evening he returned to Bethany; and then on the next morning, as they were on their way into the city, they saw what had happened to the fig tree. And then Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him; Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away (ἐξήρανται), the same Greek word as in the preceding verse. Some have thought that the fig tree was the tree forbidden to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. (See Cornelius a Lapide on Genesis 2:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - Have faith in God; literally, have the faith of God - full, perfect, effectual faith in him; faith like a grain of mustard seed. You may be staggered and perplexed at what you will see shortly; but \"have faith in God.\" The Jews may seem for a time to flourish like that green fig tree; but they will \"soon be cut down as the grass, and be withered as the green herb.\" What seems difficult to you is easy with God. Trust in the Divine omnipotence. The things which are impossible with men are possible with him. Our Lord then uses a metaphor frequently employed to indicate the accomplishment of things so difficult as to be apparently impossible. He employs a bold and vivid hyperbole; and, pointing probably to the Mount of Olives overhanging them, and on the shoulders of which they were then standing, he says, \"With this faith you might say to this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, and it shall come to pass.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them; and ye shall have them. But you must \"ask in faith, nothing wavering.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And wheresoever ye stand praying (στήκητε προσευχόμενοι). The ordinary attitude of Eastern nations in prayer is here indicated, namely, \"standing,\" with the head, doubtless, bowed in reverence. The promise of this text is that requests offered in prayer by a faithful heart will be granted - granted as God knows best. The connection of these verses with the former is close. One great hindrance to the faith without which there can be no spiritual power, is the presence of angry and uncharitable feelings. These must all be put away if we would hope for a favorable answer from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - There appears to be sufficient evidence to justify the Revisers in their omission of this verse; although its omission or retention does not affect the general exegesis of the passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - By what authority doest then these things? We learn from ver. 18 float the chief priests and scribes had already been seeking how they might destroy him, and they wanted to establish some definite charge, whether of blasphemy or of sedition, against him. They now approach him as he walked in the temple, and demand by what authority he was doing these things, such as casting out the profaners of the temple, teaching and instructing the people, accepting their Hosannas, etc. And who gave thee this authority to do these things? According to the best reading, this sentence should run, or (η} instead of καὶ) who gave thee, etc., instead of \"and who gave thee,\" etc. So that the questions are directed to two things - was his authority inherent? or, was it derived?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - I will ask of you one question (ἐπερωτήσω ὑμᾶς ἕνα λόγον). The verb justifies the translation, one question, for \"one word.\" The question which our Lord put to them was one on which hung the solution of that proposed by the scribes. It is as though he said, \"You do not believe me when I say that I have received power from God. Believe then John the Baptist, who bare witness of me that I was sent from God to do these things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? By the \"baptism of John\" our Lord means his testimony concerning himself, his doctrine, and nil his preaching. It is a synecdoche - the part put for the whole. The argument is incontrovertible. It is this: \"You ask from whence I derive my authority - from God or from men? I in my turn ask you from whom did John the Baptist derive his authority to baptize and to teach? from heaven or from men? If he had it from God, as all will confess, then I too have the same from God; for John testified of me, saying that he was but a servant, the friend of the Bridegroom; but that I was the Messiah, the Son of God: and this too when you sent messengers to him for his special purpose, that you might know from him whether he was the Messias.\" (See John 1:20; John 10:41.) Answer me. This is characteristic of St. Mark's style, and of our Lord's dignified earnestness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31, 32. - They reasoned with themselves, like men anxious and perplexed. If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? For he told you I was the promised Messias, and bade you prepare yourselves by repentance to receive my grace and salvation. But should we say, From men - they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet. This is a broken sentence, but very expressive. The evangelist leaves his reader to supply what they meant. They deemed it prudent not to finish the sentence; and probably cut it short with some significant gesture. They did not like to confess that they feared the people; although this was the true reason why they hesitated to say that John's baptism was of men. They knew that all the people held John to be a prophet. They were thus thrown on one or other horn of a dilemma.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark11:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - We know not. They had seen the life of John. They had heard his holy and Divine teaching. They were witnesses to his death for the truth; and yet they lie. They might have said,\" We think it imprudent or inexpedient to say;\" but for this they had not sufficient moral courage. Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. You will not answer my question; neither will I therefore answer yours; because your answer to mine is the answer to your own. \"He thus shows,\" says St. Jerome, \"that they knew, but would not answer; and that he knew, but did not speak, because they were silent as to what they knew.\" Our Lord did thus but mete out to them the measure which they meted to him.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And he began to speak unto them in parables. This particular parable which follows was specially directed against the scribes and Pharisees; but it was uttered in the presence of a multitude of the people. \"He began to speak... in parables.\" He had not used this form of instruction till now in Jerusalem. A man planted a vineyard. The imagery of the parable would be familiar to them from Isaiah (Isaiah 5:1). But Palestine was eminently a land of \"vineyards,\" as well as of \"oil olives.\" The man who planted the vineyard is no other than God himself. \"Thou hast brought a vine\" out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.\" The imagery is specially appropriate. No property was considered to yield so rich a return as the vineyard, and none required such unceasing care and attention. The vine represents the kingdom of God in its idea and conception; not the Jewish Church in particular. The owner of this vineyard had himself made it. (He had \"planted it.\" This planting took place in the establishment of the Jewish polity in the land of Canaan, when the heathen were cast out. He set a hedge about it. This and the following descriptions are not mere ornaments of the parable. The \"hedge\" was an important protection to the vineyard. It might be a wall or a \"quick hedge,\" a living fence. The vineyards in the East may now be seen often with a strong hedge planted round them. Such hedges, made of the prickly cactus, are to be seen at this day in the neighborhood of Joppa. Figuratively, this hedge would represent the middle wall of partition which then existed between the Jew and the Gentile; and in this, their separation from the idolatrous nations around them, lay the security of the Jews that they should enjoy the continued protection of God. It is well remarked by Archbishop Trench that the geographical position of Judaea was figurative of this, the spiritual separation of the people - guarded as Judaea was eastward by the river Jordan and its chain of lakes, northward by Antilibanus, southward by the desert and Idumaea, and westward by the Mediterranean Sea. Digged a place for the winepress (ληνός torcular); the words are literally, digged a pit for the winepress (ὤρυξεν ὑπολήνιον); the digging could only apply to the pit, a place hollowed out and then fitted with masonry. Sometimes these pits were formed out of the solid rock. Examples of these are frequent in Palestine. There were usually two pits hollowed out of the rock, one sloping to the other, and with openings between them. The grapes were placed in the upper pit; and the juice, crushed out by the feet of men, flowed into the lower pit, from whence it was taken out and put into wine-skins. \"I have trodden the winepress alone.\" And built a tower. The tower (πύργον) was probably the watch-tower, where a watchman was placed to guard the vineyard from plunderers. Particular directions are given in the rabbinical writings (see Lightfoot) for the dimensions both of the winepress and of the tower. The tower was to be ten cubits high and four cubits square. It is described as \"a high place, where the vine-dresser stands to overlook the vineyard.\" Such towers are still to be seen in Palestine, especially in the neighborhood of Bethlehem, of Hebron, and in the vine-growing districts of Lebanon. And let it out to husbandmen. The husbandmen would be the ordinary stated teachers of the people, though not excluding the people themselves. The Jewish nation in fact, both the teachers and the taught, represented the husbandmen, each member of the Church, then as now, being required to seek the welfare of the whole, body. And went into a far country (καὶ ἀπεδήμηδε); literally, and went into another country. St. Luke (Luke 20:9) adds (χρόνους ἱκανούς), \"for a long time.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-5. - And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard. St. Matthew (Matthew 21:34) says he sent \"his servants.\" St. Mark mentions them in detail. These servants were the prophets, as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others, whom the Jews persecuted and slew in different ways, as the reprovers of their vices. But the mercy of God was long-suffering, and still triumphed over their wickedness. In his account of this parable St. Mark is very minute. The first servant that was sent received no fruit, and was beaten. The second received much worse usage. According to the Authorized Version the words are, At him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled (κἀκεῖνον λιθοβολήσαντες ἐκεφαλαίωσαν καὶ ἀπέστειλαν ἠτιμωμένον). The word λιθοβολήσαντες is, however, not to be found in the best authorities; and the right reading of the next word is apparently ἐκεφαλίωσαν a very unusual word; but the context makes it plain that it expresses some injury done to the head. The other form of the word is usual enough; but it ordinarily signifies \"a summing up,\" \"a gathering up into a head.\" And handled shamefully ἠτιμωμένον); literally, dishonored. The third messenger they killed outright. The words run. And him they killed; and many others; beating some, and killing some. The construction here is incomplete, although the meaning is plain. The complete sentence would be, \"And him they killed; and they did violence to many others, beating some and killing some.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaving yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-8. - Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved. There is strong evidence in favor of a different reading here: namely (ἔτι ἕνα εἰχεν υἱὸν ἀγαπητὸν), he had yet one, a beloved son. There is something very touching in this form of expression. Many messages had been sent; many means had been tried. But one other resource remained. \"There is one, a beloved on. I will send him; they will, surely reverence him (ἐντραπήσονται τὸν υἰόν μου). They will reflect, and reflection will bring shame and submission and reverence.\" This was the last effort of Divine mercy - the sending of the Incarnate God, whom the Jews put to death without the city. St. Mark's words seem rather to imply that they killed him within the vineyard, and cast out the dead body. But it is possible that in his narrative he mentions the climax first - they killed him, and then returns to a detail of the dreadful tragedy; they cast him out of the vineyard, and there slew him (See Matthew 21:39.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? In St. Matthew's narrative the scribes answer this question. St. Luke, as St. Mark here, assigns the answer to our Lord. It would seem probable that the scribes first answered him, and that then he himself repeated their answer, and confirmed it by his looks and gesture; so that from thence, as well as from what followed, they might sufficiently understand that he spake these things of them. Then, according to St. Luke (Luke 20:16), they subjoined the words, \"God forbid!\" an expression wrung from their consciences, which accused them and told them that the parable applied to them. Here, then, we have a distinct prediction of the rejection of the Jews and the call of the Gentiles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - This quotation is from Psalm 118:22, where David prophesies of Christ. The meaning is plainly this, that the chief priests and scribes, as the builders of the Jewish Church, rejected Christ from the building as a useless stone; yea, more - they condemned and crucified him. They rejected him (ἀπεδοκίμασαν). The verb in the Greek implies that the stone was first examined and then deliberately refused. But this stone, thus disallowed and set at nought by the builders, was made the head of the corner. The image here is different from that used in the Epistles, where Christ is spoken of as the chief Corner-stone in the foundation. Here he is represented as the Corner-stone in the cornice. In real truth he is both. He is the tried Foundation-stone. But he is also the Head of the corner. In the great spiritual building he is \"all and in all,\" uniting and binding together all in one. This was the Lord's doing (παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὕτη); literally, this was from the Lord. The feminine (αὔτη) refers apparently to κεφαλή. This lifting up of the despised and rejected stone to be the Corner-stone of the cornice was God's work; and was a fitting object for wonder and praise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The scribes and Pharisees knew, partly from the words of this psalm, and partly from the looks of Christ, that they were spoken against them. So they sought in their rage and malice to lay hold on him; but they feared the people, with whom he was still popular. Thus, however, by his rebuke of the scribes and Pharisees, he prepared the way for that death which, within three days, they brought upon him. And the counsel of God was fulfilled for the redemption of men by the blood of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - St. Matthew (Matthew 22:15) tells us that \"the Pharisees took counsel how they might ensnare him (ὅπως αὐτὸν παγιδεύσωσιν) in his talk;\" namely, by proposing to him captious and insidious questions, which, in whatever way he might answer them, might expose him to danger. On this occasion they enlisted the Heredians to join them in their attack upon him. These Herodians were a sect of the Jews who supported the house of Herod, and were in favor of giving tribute to the Roman Caesar. They were so called at first from Herod the Great, who was a great supporter of Caesar. Tertullian, St. Jerome, and others say that these Herodiaus thought that Herod was the promised Messiah, because they saw that in him the scepter had departed from Judah (Genesis 49:10). Herod encouraged these flatterers, and so put to death the infants at Bethlehem, that he might thus get rid of Christ, lest any other than himself might be regarded as Christ. They said at it was on this account that he rebuilt the temple with so much magnificence. The Pharisees took, of course, altogether the other side, and stood forward as the supporters of the Law of Moses and of their national freedom. So, in order that they might ensnare him, they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, and in the most artful manner proposed to him, apparently in good faith, a question which answer it how he might, would, as they hoped, throw him upon the horns of a dilemma. If he said that tribute ought to be given to Caesar, he would expose himself to the malice of the Jewish people, who prided themselves upon their freedom. If, on the other hand, he said that tribute ought not to be given to Caesar, he would incur the wrath of Caesar and of the Roman power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - St. Matthew (Matthew 22:18) says, \"But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?' You pretend that you are approaching me with a good conscience, sincerely desirous to know how you ought to act in this matter; when at the same time you are enemies alike of me and of God, and are thirsting for my blood, and are doing all in your power to torment me, and to entangle me by fraud. \"The first virtue,\" says St. Jerome, \"of the respondent is to know the mind of the questioner, and to adapt his answer accordingly.\" These Pharisees and Heredians flatter Christ that they may destroy him; but he rebukes them, that, if possible, be might save them. Bring me a penny, that I may see it. The Roman denarius was equal to about eight-pence halfpenny. This was the coin in which the tribute money was to be paid. It had stamped upon it the image of Tiberius Caesar, the then reigning Roman emperor. The cognomen of Caesar was first given to Julius Caesar, from whom it was devolved to his successors. The current coin of the country proved the subjection of the country to him whose image was upon it. Maimonides, quoted by Dr. John Lightfoot (vol. 2 p. 230), says, \"Wheresoever the money of any king is current, there the inhabitants acknowledge that king for their lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. It is as though our Lord said, \"Since you Jews are now subject to Caesar - and there is here this evidence of it, that his coin is current amongst you; you would not use it were you not obliged, because all Gentile rites and symbols are an abhorrence to you; - but since Caesar demands nothing of you but his tribute - the coin stamped with his own image and name - it is your duty to render to him his own denarius for tribute. But spiritual things, such as worship and obedience, give these to God; for these he demands from you as his right, and by so doing you will offend neither God nor yet Caesar.\" Our Lord, in his infinite wisdom, avoids the question altogether whether the Jews were rightly in subjection to the Romans. This was a doubtful question. But there could be no doubt as to the fact that they were tributary. This was made plain by the evidence of the current coin. Now, this being so, it was manifestly the duty of the Jewish people to give to Caesar the tribute money which he demanded of them for the expenses of government, and especially of supporting an army to defend them from their enemies. And it was no less their duty to give their tribute to God, which he in his own right demanded of them as his creatures and faithful subjects. The rights of Caesar are one thing, and those of God are another; and there is nothing that need clash between them. State polity is not opposed to religion, nor religion to state. Tertullian says, \"'Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's;' that is, give to Caesar his image stamped upon his coin, and give to God his own image stamped upon you; so that while you render to Caesar the coin which is his due, you may render your own self to God.\" This wonderful answer of our Lord teaches us that we ought to try to speak so wisely, and so to moderato our speech amongst those who are captious, that we may, if possible, offend neither side, but steer safely between Scylla and Charybdis. And they marvelled at him. The true Greek reading of the verb here is not ἐθαύμασαν, but ἐξεθαύμαζον, they marvelled greatly at him; they stood marvelling greatly at him. They marvelled at his wisdom and skill in extricating himself so readily out of this net in which they had hoped to entangle him. Indeed, the words of the psalmist (Psalm 9:15) were verified in them: \"The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.\" He vaulted over the trap set for him, leaving them entangled in it. He lifted up the question far above the petty controversy of the hour, and affirmed a great principle of natural and religious obligation which belongs alike to all times and persons and places.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-23. - And there come unto him Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection. Josephus states that in the time of Judas Maceabaeus there were three sects of the Jews, differing amongst themselves, namely, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. The Hebrew word Zadoc, from which the Sadducees derive their name, means \"just.\" or\" righteous.\" These Sadducees accepted the Pentateuch, and probably more than the Pentateuch; but they rejected any oral tradition. They were known in the time of our Lord as denying those doctrines which connect us more immediately with another world, such as the existence of spirits and of angels, and the resurrection of the body. They altogether denied fate, affirming that all things are in our own power. They heard Christ preach the resurrection, and by means of it persuade men to repentance and a holy life. They therefore proposed to him a question which appeared to them to be fatal to the doctrine of a future state and a resurrection. The case supposed is that of seven brethren, who, in compliance with the Law of Moses, one after another, as each died in succession, took the same woman to wife. It is probable that such a case may actually have occurred; at any rate, it was a possible case. And the question founded upon it by the Sadducees was this - Whose wife would she be of them in the resurrection? Here, then, they hoped to entangle him, and to show that the doctrine of the resurrection was absurd. For if our Lord should say that in the resurrection she would be the wife of one only, the other brethren would have been excited to envy and continual strife. Nor could he have said that she would be common to the seven brothers. Such were the absurdities which, as they intimated, would flow out of his doctrine of the resurrection, if it could be proved. But our Lord scatters to the winds all this foolish reasoning, by adding one clause omitted by them, and overlooked by men of mere earthly minds, namely, that in the world to come this widow would be the wife of none of the seven brethren.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMaster, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - These Sadducees erred in two ways:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) They did not know or remember the Scriptures, such as that in Job (Job 21:25), \"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\" etc., or in Isaiah (Isaiah 26:19), \"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise;\" or in Daniel (Daniel 12:2), \"Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,\" etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) They did not know the power of God, namely, that he can raise the bodies of the dead again to life, even as at first he created them out of nothing; for a greater power is required to make that to be which was not, than to make that again to be which once was. But then the resurrection life will be a new life, spiritual, glorious, eternal, like that of the angels. So in these words our Lord struck at the double root of the error of the Sadducees:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) ignorance of the Scriptures, which plainly teach the resurrection; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) ignorance of the power of God, which led them to interpret these Scriptures, which speak of the resurrection, to mean only a mystical resurrection from vice to virtue.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But are as angels in heaven - not \"the angels;\" the οἱ is omitted. The blessed, after the resurrection, will be like angels as to purity, as to a spiritual life, as to immortality, as to happiness and glory. There will be no necessity for marriages in heaven. Here, on earth, the father dies, but he lives on in his children after death. In heaven there is no death, but every one will live and be blessed for ever; and therefore it is that St. Luke adds here, \"Neither can they die any more.\" St. Augustine says, \"Marriages are on account of children; children on account of succession; succession on account of death. But in heaven, as there is no death, neither is there any marriage.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - St. Mark is here careful to state that what St. Matthew describes as \"the word spoken by God\" was to be found in the book of Moses (Exodus 3:5), in the place concerning the Bush (ἐπὶ τῆς βάτου), as it is correctly rendered in the Revised Version. Our Lord might have brought yet clearer proofs out of Job, Daniel, Ezekiel, etc.; but in his wisdom he preferred to allege this out of Moses and the Pentateuch, because, whatever the views of the Sadducees may have been as to other parts of the Old Testament, these books of Moses they readily acknowledged. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. The force of the argument is this, that \"God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.\" Their souls are still alive; and if these patriarchs are still alive, there will be a resurrection. If men are to live for ever, they will, sooner or later, live again in the completeness of their being, namely, of body and soul and spirit. Our Lord would, therefore, say this: \"In a few days you will put me to death; but in three days I shall rise again from the dead. And after that, in due time I shall raise them from the dead at the last day, and bring them in triumph with me into heaven.\" The Sadducees and the Epicureans denied the resurrection, because they denied the immortality of the soul; for these two doctrines hang together. For if the soul is immortal, then, since it naturally depends upon the body, it is necessary that the body should rise. Otherwise the soul would continue to exist in a dislocated state, and would only obtain a divided life and an imperfect existence. Hence our Lord here distinctly proves the resurrection of the body from the immortality of the soul. When he speaks of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he does not speak of their souls only, but of their whole being. Therefore, though they are for a time dead to us, yet they live to God, and sleep, as it were, because ere long God will raise them from death, as from a sleep, to a blessed and endless life. For all, though they have passed out of our sight, still live to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Ye therefore do greatly err. The Greek is, omitting the οϋν, simply ὑμεῖς πολὺ πλανᾶσθε, Ye greatly err. The omission is more consistent with St. Mark's usual style. The Sadducees entirely misunderstood the meaning of their own Scriptures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - St. Matthew (Matthew 22:34) says here that the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together, and that then one of them, who was a lawyer (νομίνος), that is, \"a scribe,\" asked him this question, What commandment is the first of all? It appears here from St. Mark that this scribe had been present at the discussion with the Sadducees, and he had probably informed the others of what had taken place, and of the wisdom and power of our Lord's answer; so he was naturally put forward to try our Lord with another crucial question. It does not necessarily appear that he had an evil intention in putting this question. He may, in his own mind (seeing the wisdom and skill of our Lord), have desired to hear what Christ had to say to a very difficult question on a matter deeply interesting to all true Hebrews. The question was one much mooted amongst the Jews in the time of our Lord. \"For many,\" says Beds, \"thought that the first commandment in the Law related to offerings and sacrifices, with regard to which so much is said in Leviticus, and that the right worship of God consisted in the due offering of these.\" On this account the Pharisees encouraged children to say \"Corban\" to their parents; and hence this candid and truth-loving scribe, when he heard our Lord's answer about the love of God and of our neighbor, said that such obedience was worth \"more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" With regard to the love of God, St. Bernard says, \"The measure of our love to God is to love him without measure; for the immense goodness of God deserves all the love that we can possibly give to him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. God is to be loved above everything - above all angels, or men, or any created thing. But after God, amongst created things, our neighbor is above all to be loved. And we are to extend to our neighbor that kind of love with which we love ourselves. Our love of ourselves is not a frigid love, but a sincere and ardent love. In like manner we should love our neighbour, and desire for him all those good things both for the body and for the soul that we desire for ourselves. This is what our Lord himself teaches us. \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, even so do unto them.\" There is none other commandment greater than these. St. Matthew (Matthew 22:40) says, \"On these two commandments hang the whole Law and the prophets.\" There is no commandment greater than these, because all the precepts of the Divine Law are included in them. So that our Lord here teaches us that we ought continually to have these two precepts in our minds and before our eyes, and direct all our thoughts and words and actions by them, and regulate our whole life according to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The first words of this verse should be rendered thus: Of a truth, Master, thou hast well said that he is one. In the remainder of the scribe's answer we find a different word used in the Greek for\" mind,\" or \"understanding,\" from that just used by our Lord. In our Lord's answer the word is διάνοια. Here it is σύνεσις. Both words are well rendered by \"understanding.\" It is an act of understanding. It is the thought associating itself with the object, and \"standing under\" it so as to support it. (See Dr. Morison on St. Mark.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Is more (περισσότερόν) - according to the most approved reading, more - than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. This scribe was evidently emerging out of the bondage of ceremonial things, and perceiving the supremacy of the moral law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly (νουνεχῶς), he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. It would appear from this answer that our Lord regarded him as one who approached him with the sincere desire to know the truth, and so he encouraged him. This shows how powerful an influence our Lord's teaching had already exercised amongst all classes of the Jews. This scribe, notwithstanding the prejudices of his class, had reached the border-land of the kingdom. He had learnt that the true way to the kingdom was by the love of God and of our neighbor. He was not far from the kingdom - not far from \"the Church militant here on earth,\" by which is the way to the Church triumphant in heaven. He was not far from the kingdom, but still he wanted that which in the true pathway to the kingdom - faith in Christ as the Savior of the world. And no man after that durst ask him any question. St. Matthew (Matthew 22:46) places these words after the next occurrence. But there is no inconsistency in the two narratives, because in this next incident our Lord puts the question to them; and this silenced both their questioning and their answering. All felt that there was such a vast reach of wisdom and knowledge in all that he said, that it was in vain to contend with him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Our Lord was now in the temple, and he took the opportunity for instructing the scribes and Pharisees concerning his person and his dignity. Thus, as ever, he returned good for evil. He here taught them that the Messiah was not a mere man, as they supposed, but that he was i both God and man, and that therefore they ought not to wonder or to be offended because he called himself the Son of God. St. Matthew (Matthew 22:42) more fully gives their answer first, namely, that \"Christ is the Son of David.\" They should have said that, as God, he was the Son of God, according to those words, \"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;\" but that, as man, he was the Son of David. Their answer was very different from that of Peter: \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" But they wanted the Divine knowledge which the disciples had gained.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The Lord said unto my Lord. From this verse (Psalm 110.) our Lord shows that the Messiah, such as he was, was not a mere man, as the Pharisees thought, but that he was God, and therefore David's Lord. The meaning, therefore, is this, \"The Lord God said to my Lord,\" that is, Christ, \"Sit thou at my right hand,\" that is, when, after his cross, his death, and his resurrection, he will exalt him far above all principality and power, and place him next to him in heaven, that he may reign with supreme happiness and power and glory over all creatures. These words show that this is a Divine decree, fixed and irrevocable. Till I make thine enemies thy footstool (ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου); literally, the footstool of thy feet; that is, reign with me in glory until the day of judgment, when I will make the wicked, all opposing powers, subject to thee. The word \"till\" does not imply that Christ will then cease to reign. \"Of his kingdom there shall be no end.\" But he will then formally deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father, only that he may receive it again as the second Person of the Godhead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDavid therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38, 39. - These verses are a condensation of the woes recorded at length by St. Matthew (23.). And he said unto them in his doctrine (ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ αὑτοῦ) - literally, in his teaching - Beware of the scribes which desire (τῶν θελόντων) to walk in long robes (ἐν στολαῖς). The στόλη was a rich robe which reached down to the ankles, and was adorned with fringes. The scribes took pleasure in this kind of display. The salient points in their character were ostentation, avarice, and religious hypocrisy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - There is a change in the construction here, which is not marked in the Authorized Version. The sentence in this fortieth verse should stand alone, and be read thus: They which devour (οἱ κατεσθίοντες) widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these shall receive greater condemnation. The sentence thus read is far more graphic. The statement thus becomes indeed more general, but the reference is still to the scribes who through their avarice swallowed up the property of helpless widows, and through their hypocrisy, in the hope of thus more effectually imposing upon their victims, lengthened out their prayers. Greater condemnation. The word in the Greek is κρίμα, that is, \"judgment.\" A severer sentence would fall upon them in the day of judgment and a heavier condemnation, because, under the semblance of piety, they practiced iniquity, and indulged their avarice under the mask of religion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - He sat down over against the treasury (γαζοφυλάκιον, from γάζα, a Persian word meaning \"treasure,\" and φυλάττειν, to guard). This was the receptacle into which the offerings of the people were east, for the uses of the temple and for the benefit of the priests and of the poor. Hence that part of the temple in which these gifts were kept was called the treasury. He beheld (ἐθεώρει) - literally, he was beholding; he was observing - how the multitude πῶς ὁ ὄχλος - that is, in what manner, with what motives (for he was the heart-searcher) the crowd of givers - cast money (βάλλει χαλκόν); literally, is casting· St. Luke uses the term (τὰ δῶρα) \"their gifts.\" Many that were rich cast in much (πολλά), that is, \"many pieces.\" There were several apertures in the treasury, which from their shape were called trumpets. Some of these had special inscriptions, marking the destination of the offerings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - A poor widow (μία χήρα πτωχὴ); literally, one poor widow; one specially singled out for notice. St. Luke says, εῖδε δὲ καί τινα χήραν πενιχρὰν: literally, a widow who supported herself by her own little labor. And she cast in two mites (λεπτὰ), which make a farthing. The farthing was the fourth part of an as, and ten of these made a denarius. The Greek word (λεπτὰ) means literally \"thin pieces.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 43, 44. - This poor widow hath cast in more. The right reading of the verb here is ἔβαλε, not βέβληκε; this aoristic rendering has very good authority - this poor widow cast in more. Her act is completed, and has gone up for a memorial before God . She \"gave\" more than all the others who are casting (τῶν βαλλόντων), not \"have cast in (τῶν βαλόντων).\" She gave more, when she threw in those two mites, than all the others were giving - more, that is, in the estimation of him who sees not as man sees. God does not weigh the gift so much as the mind of the giver. That gift is really the greater in his sight, not which is actually of greater value, but which is greater in respect of the giver. Therefore this poor widow, when she gave her farthing, gave more than they all, because she gave all her living - all, that is, that she had beforehand for that day, trusting that the Lord would give her her bread for that day. And so she carried off the palm for liberality, Christ himself proudly present, but what you offer with being the Judge. St. Ambrose says, \"That humility and devotion.\" which God esteems is not that which you proudly present, but what you offer with humility and devotion.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark12:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Mark.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him Master, behold, what manner, of stones and what manner of buildings! This would be in the evening. According to St. Luke (Luke 21:37), our Lord, during the early part of this week, passed his nights upon the Mount of Olives, taking his food at Bethany with Martha and Mary, and spending his days in the temple at Jerusalem, teaching the people. It is most probable that he left the temple by the golden gate on the east, from whence the view of the temple would be particularly striking. We learn from St. Matthew (24.) that our Lord had just been predicting the fall of Jerusalem. It was, therefore, natural for the disciples to call his attention at that moment to the grandeur and beauty of the building and its surroundings. The temple at Jerusalem was one of the wonders of the world. Josephus says that it wanted nothing that the eye and the mind could admire. It shone with a fiery splendor; so that when the eye gazed upon it, it turned away as from the rays of the sun. The size of the foundation-stones was enormous. Josephus speaks of some of the stones as forty-five cubits in length, five in height, and six in breadth. One of the foundation-stones, measured in recent times, proved to be nearly twenty-four feet in length, by four feet in depth. But all this magnificence had no effect upon our Lord, who only repeated the sentence of its downfallNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - There shall not be left here one stone upon another, which shall not be thrown down. The word (ῶδε) \"here\" is rightly inserted; and the prophecy is justified by scientific investigation. The expression is not hyperbolic. Modern investigation shows that the present wall has been rebuilt, probably on the foundation of the older One.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, Tell us, when shall these things be? St. Matthew and St. Luke only mention his disciples generally. St. Mark, going more into detail, gives the names of those who thus asked him; namely, Peter and James and John, already distinguished, and Andrew, who enjoyed the distinction of having been the first called. These men appear to have been our Lord's inner council; and they asked him (κατ ἰδίαν) privately, or separately, not only from the multitude, but from the rest of the disciples. It was a dangerous thing to speak of the destruction of the temple, or even to inquire about such an event, for fear of the scribes and Pharisees. It was this accusation that led to the stoning of Stephen. It is evident from St. Matthew (Matthew 24:3) that the disciples closely associated together the destruction of the temple and his final coming at the end of the world. They knew from our Lord's words that the destruction of Jerusalem was near at hand, and therefore they thought that the destruction of the world itself, and the day of judgment, were also near at hand. Hence their questions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - Take heed that no man lead you astray. The Greek word is πλανήση. Their first temptation would be of this kind - that many would come in Christ's name, saying, \"I am he;\" claiming, that is, the title which belonged to him alone. Such were Theudas (Acts 5:36) and Simon Magus (Acts 8:10), who, according to Jerome, said, \"Ego sum Sermo Dei, ego speciosus, ego Paracletus, ego omnipotens, ego omnia.\" Such were Menander and the Gnostics.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Wars and rumors of wars. \"Rumours of wars\" are mentioned, because they are often worse and more distressing than wars themselves; according to the saying, \"Pejor est belle timer ipse belli.\" Be not troubled; be not troubled, that is, so as to let go your faith in me, through fear of the enemy, or through despair of any fruit of your apostolic labors; but persevere steadfastly to preach faith in me and in my gospel. These things must needs come to pass; but the end is not yet. There would be a succession of calamities, one leading on to another. But they must take courage, and prepare themselves for greater evils, not hoping for lasting peace on earth, but by patient endurance of evils here, reach onwards to a blessed and eternal rest in heaven. Our Lord, when his disciples asked him, as in one breath, about the destruction of their city, replied obscurely and ambiguously; mingling together the two events, in order that his disciples and the faithful through all times might be prepared, and never taken by surprise. Some of our Lord's predictions, however, clearly refer to the generation then living on the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the gospel must first be published among all nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations. St. Matthew (Matthew 24:14) says it shall be preached \"in the whole world, for a testimony unto all the nations\" (ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ οἰκουμένῃ εἰς μαρτύριον). This literally took place, as far as the inhabited world was concerned at that time, before the destruction of Jerusalem. St. Paul (Romans 10:18) reminds us that \"their sound is gone out into all lands, and their words unto the ends of the world;\" and he tells the Colossians (Colossians 1:6) that the gospel was come unto them, and was bearing fruit and increasing in all the world. But even if we regard these expressions as somewhat hyperbolic, it is unquestionable that before the armies of Titus entered Jerusalem, the gospel had been published through the principal parts and provinces of the then inhabited world (οἰκουμένῃ). And it is certainly a wonderful fact that within fifty years after the death of Christ, Christian Churches had been planted in almost every district of the earth as then known to the Romans. But if we extend these prophetical sayings so as to reach onwards to the end of all things, we must then understand the expression, \"all the nations,\" in its most unrestricted sense; so that the prophecy announces the universal proclamation of the gospel over the whole inhabited earth as an event which is to precede the time of the end. It is interesting to observe the difference in the amount of knowledge possessed by us of this earth and its population at the present time, as compared with the knowledge which men had of it at the time when our Lord delivered this prediction. It was not until the beginning of the sixteenth century, nearly fifteen hundred years after Christ, that Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci laid open that other hemisphere which takes its name from Amerigo; and there are few facts more interesting to a philosophic mind than the discovery of this new continent, now so important to us in England as the chief receptacle, together with Australia, of our redundant population. But this new world, as we call it, although there are material evidences that portions of it at least were occupied in very remote times by men of high civilization, was present to the mind of our Lord when he said that \"the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations.\" So that the prophecy expands, as the ages roll onwards and the population of this earth increases; and it still demands its fulfillment, embracing the vast multitudes now dwelling on the face of the earth to the number of about 1,450,000,000. Such a consideration may well lead us to the inference that we are now approaching sensibly nearer to the end of the world. There are no other new worlds like America or Australia now to be discovered. The whole face of the earth is now laid open to us; and there is now hardly any part of the world which has not at some time or other received the message of salvation. Ver 11. - And when they lead you to judgment, and deliver you up, be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak. Our Lord does not mean by this that they were not to premeditate a prudent and wise answer Rut he means that they were not to be too anxious about it. In St. Luke (Luke 21:15) he says, \"I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay.\" So here, it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost who shall inspire you with wisdom and courage. The words \"neither do ye premeditate\" (μηδὲ μελετᾶτε) are omitted in the Revised Version, as not having sufficient authority.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Our Lord further warns his disciples that they would have to suffer persecution even from their own relations, their brethren, and their fathers, who, forgetful of natural affection, would persecute the faithful even unto death. It is related of Woodman, a martyr in Sussex, in Queen Mary's time, that he was betrayed and taken by his father and his brother, and that he comforted himself with the thought that this very text of Scripture was verified in him. Bede says that our Lord predicted these evils, in order that his disciples, by a knowledge of them beforehand, might be the better able to bear them when they came.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake (ὑπο πάντων). The faith and preaching of a crucified Savior was a new thing. Hence everywhere, the Jews, accustomed to their own Law, and the Gentiles, to their own idols, set themselves against the preachers of the gospel, and against those who were converted to it. \"All men\" means great numbers, perhaps the greater number. Just as, when we say, \"The majority are doing anything,\" we say, in popular language, \"Everybody does it.\" But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved (ὁ δὲ ὑπομείνας εἰς τέλος). What is \"the end\" here referred to? Not, I imagine, the end of the age, but the end of the moral probation of the individual. The Greek word for \"endureth\" is very significant; it implies \"a bearing up, and persevering under great trials.\" It is not enough once and again or a third time to have overcome, but, in order to obtain the crown, it is necessary to endure and to conquer, even to the end. \"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.\" The crown of patience is perseverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not. In the Authorized Version, after the word \"desolation,\" the words \"spoken of by Daniel the prophet,\" are introduced, but without sufficient authority. They were probably interpolated from St. Matthew, where there is abundant authority for them; and thus their omission by St. Mark does not affect the argument drawn from them in favor of the genuineness of the Book of Daniel, against those, whether in earlier or in later times, who reject this book, or ascribe it to some mere recent authorship. The \"abomination of desolation\" is a Hebrew idiom, meaning \"the abomination that maketh desolate.\" St. Luke (Luke 21:20) does not use the expression; it would have sounded strange to his Gentile readers. He says, \"When ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.\" This reference to the Roman armies by St. Luke has led some commentators to suppose that \"the abomination of desolation\" meant the Roman eagles. But this was a sign from without; whereas \"the abomination of desolation\" was a sign from within, connected with the ceasing of the daily sacrifice of the temple. It is alluded to by the Prophet Daniel in three places, namely, Daniel 9:27; Daniel 11:31; Daniel 12:11. We must seek for its explanation in something within the temple. \"standing in the holy place\" (Matthew 24:15) - some profanation of the temple, on account of which God's judgments would fall on Jerusalem. Now, Daniel's prophecy had already received one fulfillment ( B.C. 168), when we read (1 Macc. 1:54) that they set up \"the abomination of desolation upon the altar.\" This was when Antiochus Epiphanes set up the statue of Jupiter on the great altar of burnt sacrifice. But that \"abomination of desolation\" was the forerunner of another and a worse profanation yet to come, which our Lord, no doubt, had in his mind when he called the attention of his disciples to these predictions by Daniel. There is a remarkable passage in Josephus ('Wars of the Jews,' 4:6), in which he refers to an ancient saying then current, that \"Jerusalem would be taken, and the temple be destroyed, when it had been defiled by the hands of Jews themselves.\" Now, this literally took place. For while the Roman armies were investing Jerusalem, the Jews within the city were in fierce conflict amongst themselves. And it would seem most probable that our Lord had in his mind, in connection with Daniel's prophecy, more especially that at Daniel 9:27, the irruption of the army of Zealots and Assassins into the temple, filling the holy place with the dead bodies of their own fellow-citizens. The Jews had invited these marauders to defend them against the army of the Romans; and they, by their outrages against God, were the special cause of the desolation of Jerusalem. Thus, while St. Luke points to the sign from without, namely, the Roman forces surrounding the city, St. Matthew and St. Mark refer to the more terrible sign from within, the \"abomination of desolation \" - the abomination that would fill up the measure of their iniquities, and cause the avenging power of Rome to come down upon them and crush them. It was after these two signs - the sign from within and the sign from without - that Jerusalem was laid prostrate. Therefore our Lord proceeds to warn both Jews and Christians alike, that when they saw these signs they should flee unto the mountains - not to the mountains of Judaea, for these were already occupied by the Roman army (Josephus; lib. 3 cap. 12.), but those further off, beyond Judaea. We know from Eusebius (3:15) that the Christians fled to Pella, on the other side of the Jordan. The Jews, on the other hand, as they saw the Roman army approaching nearer, betook themselves to Jerusalem, as to an asylum, thinking that there they would be under the special protection of Jehovah; but there, alas, they were imprisoned and slain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let him that is on the house-top (ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος) not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house. The roofs of the houses were flat, with frequently a little \"dome\" (δῶμα) in the center. The people lived very much upon them; and the stairs were outside, so that a person wishing to enter the house must first descend by these outer stairs. The words, therefore, mean that he must flee suddenly, if he would save his life, even though he might lose his goods, he must escape, perhaps by crossing over the parapet of his own housetop, and so from house-top to house-top, until he could find a convenient point for flight into the hill country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloke (τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ ). This was the outer garment or pallium. They who worked in the field were accustomed to leave their cloak and their tunic at home; so that, half-stripped, they might be more free to labor. Therefore our Lord warns them that in this impending destruction, so suddenly would it come, they must be ready to fly just as they were. It was the direction given to Lot, \"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days! Women in this condition would be specially objects of pity, for they would be more exposed to danger. The words, \"Woe to them (οὐαι)!\" are an exclamation of pity, as, though it was said, \"Alas! for them.\" Josephus (7:8) mentions that some mothers, constrained by hunger during the siege, devoured their own infants!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And pray ye that it be not in the winter. According to the best authorities, \"your flight\" (ἡ φυγὴ ὑμῶν) is omitted, but the meaning remains very much the same. St. Matthew (Matthew 24:20) adds, \"neither on a sabbath.\" But this would be comparatively of little interest to those to whom St. Mark was writing. Our Lord thus specifies the winter, because at that season, on account of the cold and snow, flight would be attended with special difficulty and hardship, and would be almost impossible for the aged and infirm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For those days shall be tribulation, such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation. These expressions are very remarkable. To begin with, the tribulation would be so unexampled and so severe that the days themselves would be called \"tribulation.\" They would be known ever after as \"the tribulation.'\" There never had been anything like them, and there never would be again. Neither the Deluge, nor the destruction of the cities of the plain, nor the drowning of Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, nor the slaughter of the Canaanites, nor the destruction of Nineveh, or of Babylon, or of other great cities and nations, would be so violent and dreadful as the overthrow of Jerusalem by Titus. All this is confirmed by Josephus, who says, speaking of this overthrow, \"I do not think that any state ever suffered such things, or any nation within the memory of man.\" St. Chrysostom assigns the cause of all this to the base and cruel treatment of the Son of God by the Jews. The destruction of their city and their temple, and their continued desolation afterwards, were the lessons by which the Jews were to be taught that the Christ had indeed come, and that this was the Christ whom they had crucified and slain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And except the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days. St. Matthew's record (Matthew 24:22) differs from that of St. Mark in the omission of the words \"the Lord,\" and the clause \"whom he chose.\" If the time of the siege of Jerusalem had lasted much longer, not one of the nation could have survived; all would have perished by war, or famine, or pestilence. The Romans raged against the Jews as an obstinate and rebellious nation, and would have exterminated them. But \"the Lord\" shortened the time of this frightful catastrophe, for the elect's sake, that is, partly for the sake of the Christians who could not escape from Jerusalem, and partly for that of the Jews, who, subdued by this awful visitation, were converted to Christ or would hereafter be converted to him We learn from hence how great is the love of God towards his elect, and his care for them. For their sakes he spared many Jews. For their sakes he created and preserves the whole world. Yea, for their sakes, Christ the eternal Son was made man, and became obedient unto death. \"All things are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.\" It may be added that a number of providential circumstances combined to shorten these days of terror. Titus was himself disposed to clemency, and friendly towards Josephus. Moreover, he was attached to Bernice, a Jewess, the sister of Agrippa. All these and other circumstances conspired in the providence of God to \"shorten the days.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - And then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is the Christ; or, Lo, there, believe it not; for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets. Josephus mentions one Simon of Gerasa, who, pretending to be a deliverer of the people from the Romans, gathered around him a crowd of followers, and gained admission into Jerusalem, and harassed the Jews. In like manner, Eleazar and John, leaders of the Zealots, gained admission into the holy place, under pretense of defending the city, but really that they might plunder it. But it seems as though our Lord here. looked beyond the siege of Jerusalem to the end of the world; and he warns us that as the time of his second advent approaches, deceivers will arise, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. The word \"to seduce\" (ἀποπλανᾶν) is more properly rendered, as in the Revised Version, to lead astray. Every age has produced its crop of such deceivers; and it may be expected that, as the time of the end draws nearer and nearer, their number will increase. Sometimes those idiosyncrasies in them which show themselves in lying wonders, are the result of self-delusion; but still oftener they are deliberate attempts made for the purpose of imposing on the unwary. Sometimes they are a combination of both. In the cases to which our Lord refers there is evidently an intention to lead astray, although it may have had its origin in self-deceit. In our day there is a sad tendency to lead men astray with regard to the great fundamental verities of Christianity. And the words of St. Jerome may well be remembered here: \"If any would persuade you that Christ is to be found in the wilderness of unbelief or sceptical philosophy, or in the secret chambers of heresy, believe them not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - But take ye heed (ὑμεῖς δὲ βλέπετε). The \"ye\" is here emphatic. The disciples were around him, hanging upon his lips. But his admonition is meant for Christians everywhere, even to the end of the world.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light. St. Matthew (Matthew 24:29) has the word \"immediately,\" before the words \"after that tribulation.\" If this word \"immediately\" is to be understood literally, then the things spoken of subsequently must be understood in a figurative and spiritual sense. But it would seem more natural to understand \"immediately\" according to the reckoning of him with whom \"a thousand years are as one day.\" Our Lord now passes away from the events connected with the overthrow of the Jewish polity, and proceeds to speak of things connected with the new dispensation. His mind is now turned to \"the last time\" - to the whole period between his first and his second advent. The things towards which he was now looking belonged, not to the end of the Jewish dispensation, but to the end of the present age and the present dispensation. Eighteen centuries have passed since the destruction of Jerusalem; and more years, it may be, will come and go before the end. Nevertheless, all this time, although it may seem long to us who are confined within the narrow limits of a short life, is nevertheless, when compared with the eternity of God, but as a moment. \"The sun shall be darkened.\" The signs here enumerated are mentioned elsewhere as the signs that would appear before the second coming of Christ. (See Joel 2:31 and Luke 21:25, 26.) St. Augustine (Ep. 80, 'Ad Hesychium') says, \"The light of truth shall be obscured; because in the great tribulation that shall come on the world, many will fall from the faith, who had seemed to be bright and firm, like the sun and the stars.\" \"And the moon,\" that is, the Church, \"shall not give her light.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And the stars shall be falling from heaven (ἔσονται ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πίπτοντες) and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken. In the great events of the creation recorded in Genesis 1 the sun and the moon and the stars did not show their light until that period which is called the fourth day. So in the end of the world, the sun and the moon and the stars are represented as withdrawing their light, perhaps figuratively, but perhaps also literally, in the course of some of the unknown physical changes which shall accompany the winding up of the present dispensation. To this agree the next words, \"the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.\" The powers may here mean those great unseen forces of nature by which the universe is now held in equipoise. When the Creator wills it, these powers shall be shaken. (See Job 26:11, \"The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof;\" see also Isaiah 34:4, \"And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll.\") As the end of the world approaches, the elements will quiver and tremble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory. St. Matthew (Matthew 24:30) introduces here the words, \"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven.\" Many of the Fathers, as St. Chrysostom, Jerome, Bede, and others, think that this sign will be the cross. Josephus (5:3) says that shortly before the destruction of Jerusalem, a portent like a sword, glittering as a star, appeared in the heavens. But surely the sign of the Son of man at the end of the world will be the Son of man himself coming in clouds. The clouds, covering the troubled heaven and now illuminated by the brightness of his coming, will constitute \"the sublime drapery of his presence\" (Dr. Morison).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And then shall he send forth the angels. This represents the great harvest at the end of the world, when the angel-reapers shall be sent forth to separate the wicked from the just. The elect will be gathered from the four winds (ἐκ τῶν πεσσάρων ἀνέμων); literally, out of the four winds - the winds representing figuratively every corner of the world; or, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. At its extremities, in the horizon, there appears to be the end alike of earth and of heaven, as though earth and heaven joined, and the heaven terminated by melting into the earth and becoming one with it. The expression simply means, \"from horizon to horizon,\" or from every part of the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28, 29. - Now from the fig tree learn her parable; that is, her own particular teaching. Our Lord makes frequent mention and use of the fig tree, as we have seen already. It is probable that a fig tree may have been near to them. When her branch is now become tender, and putteth forth its leaves, ye know that the summer is nigh. The branch (κλάδος) would be the young shoot, now become tender under the quickening influences of the spring; and this was an evident sign that the summer was at hand. The Asiatic fig tree requires a considerable amount of warmth to enable it to put forth leaves and fruit. Its rich flavour requires a summer heat to mature it. Aristotle says that the fig is the choice food of bees, from which they make their richest honey. Then the fig tree does not flower after the ordinary manner; but produces flower and fruit at once from the tree, and rapidly matures the fruit. The lesson, therefore, from the fig tree is this - the speed with which she ripens her fruit when she feels the warmth of summer. In like manner, as soon as the disciples perceived the signs of Christ's coming, they were to learn that he was close at hand, as certainly as the ripening fruit of the fig tree showed that summer was at hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. This generation shall not pass away, until all these things be accomplished. This is one of those prophecies which admit of a growing fulfillment. If the word \"generation\" (γανεὰ) be understood (as it may undoubtedly be understood) to mean the sum total of those living at any time on the earth, the prediction would hold true as far as the destruction of Jerusalem was concerned. The destruction of Jerusalem took place within the limits of the generation living in our Lord's time; and there might be some of those whom he was then addressing who would live to see the event. His prediction amounted, in fact, to this, that the destruction of Jerusalem would take place within forty years of the time when he was speaking. But it may have a wider meaning. It may mean the Jewish people. Their city would be destroyed their power overthrown. They would be \"peeled and scattered.\" But they would still remain a distinct and separate nation to the end of the world. And there are other prophecies which show that with their national conversion to Christianity will be associated all that is most glorious in the future Church of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHeaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. Here is a distinct prediction that the present structure of the universe will pass away; that is, that it will be changed, that it will perish, as far as its present state and condition are concerned; but only that it may be refashioned in a more beautiful form. \"We look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness\" (2 Peter 3:13). With this declaration of our blessed Lord all the discoveries of science coincide. Astronomy and geology alike concur in the conclusion that the whole system of the universe is moving onwards to its change. Our blessed Lord did but affirm that which is demonstrated by science. But my words shall not pass away; not merely the words which with his full self-consciousness he had just uttered respecting Jerusalem, but all his other words - all the revelation of God, all the words of him who is the Truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - But of that day or that hour knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. He who from all eternity has decreed the time when this day is to come, is pleased to hide it in the hidden depths of his own counsels. But the eternal Son, and the Holy Spirit, both alike one with the Father, are of his counsels. They are not excluded from this knowledge; they, equally with the Father, know the day and the hour of the end, since they are of the same substance, power, and majesty. Why; then, does St. Mark here add, \"neither the Son\"? The answer is surely to be found in the great truth of the hypostatic union. The eternal Son, as God, by his omniscience, and as man, by knowledge imparted to him, knows perfectly the day and the hour of the future judgment. But Christ as man, and as the Messenger from God to men, did not so know it as to be able to reveal it to men. The ambassador, if he is asked concerning the secret counsels of his sovereign, may truly answer that he knows them not so as to communicate them to others. For as an ambassador he only communicates those things which are committed to him by his sovereign to deliver, and not those things which he is bidden to keep secret.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-37. - These exhortations, which gather up in a succinct form the practical bearing of the parallel passages and parables in St. Matthew, must not be understood as implying that our Lord's coming in judgment would be during the lifetime of his disciples. The preceding words would teach them plainly enough that the actual time of this coming was hidden from the. m. But the intention was that, while by the certainty of the event their faith and hope would be quickened, by the uncertainty of the time they might be left in a continual state of watchfulness and prayer. According to the Jewish reckoning, there were only three watches - namely, the first watch, from sunset to 10 p.m.; the second watch, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.; and the third watch, from 2 a.m. to sunrise. But after the establishment of the Roman power in Judaea, these watches were divided into four; and were either described as the first, second, third, and fourth respectively; or, as here, by the terms even, beginning at six and ending at nine; midnight, ending at twelve; cockcrowing, ending at three; and morning, ending at six.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWatch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark13:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Mark.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now after two days was the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread; literally, the passover and the unleavened τό πάσχα καὶ τὰ ἄζυμα. It was one and the same festival. The killing of the Paschal lamb took place on the first of the seven days during which the festival lasted, and during the whole of which they used unleavened bread. Josephus describes it as \"the festival of the unleavened, called Phaska by the Jews.\" The chief priests and the scribes. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:3) says, \"The chief priests and the elders of the people.\" The two classes in the Sanhedrim who actually combined to put our Lord to death were those here mentioned by St. Mark. They sought how they might take him with subtlety (ἐν δόλῳ), and kill him. It is, literally, they were seeking (ἐλήτουν). The verb with its tense implies continuous and eager desire. They used subtlety, because they feared lest he should escape out of their hands. Moreover they feared the people, lest they should fight for him, and not suffer him to be taken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For they said (ἔλεγον γὰρ) literally, for they were saying - Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people. The same cause induced them to avoid the time of the feast. The feast brought a great multitude of Jews to Jerusalem, amongst whom would be many who had received bodily or spiritual benefits from Christ, and who therefore, at least, worshipped him as a Prophet; and the rulers of the people feared lest these should rise in his defense. Their first intention, therefore, was not to destroy him until after the close of the Paschal feast; but they were overruled by the course of events, all ordered by God's never-failing providence. The sudden betrayal of our Lord by Judas led them to change their minds. For when they found that he was actually in their hands, they resolved to crucify him forthwith. And thus the Divine purpose was fulfilled that Christ should suffer at that particular time, and so the type be satisfied. For the lamb slain at the Passover was a type of the very Paschal Lamb to be sacrificed at that particular time, in the predetermined purpose of God; and to be lifted up upon the cross for the redemption of the world. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:3) tells us that they were gathered together \"unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.\" It was necessary to state his name, because the high priests were now frequently changed by the Roman power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And while he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse (ἀλάβαστρον) - literally, an alabaster; as we say, \"a glass,\" of a vessel made of glass - of ointment of spikenard very costly (μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτελοῦς); and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head. This anointing of our Lord appears to have taken place on the Saturday before Palm Sunday (see John 12:1). The anointing mentioned by St. Luke (Luke 7:36) evidently has reference to some previous occasion. The narrative here and in St. Matthew and St. John would lead us to the conclusion that this was a feast given by Simon - perhaps in grateful acknowledgment of the miracle which had been wrought upon Lazarus. He is called \"Simon the leper,\" probably because he had been a leper, and had been healed by Christ, although he still retained the name of \"leper,\" to distinguish him from others named Simon, or Simeon, a common name amongst the Jews. There came a woman. This woman, we learn from St. John (John 12:2, 3), was Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The vessel, or cruse, which she had with her was made of alabaster, a kind of soft, smooth marble, which could easily be scooped out so as to form a receptacle for ointment, which, according to Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 13:3), was best preserved in vessels made of alabaster. The vessel would probably be formed with a long narrow neck, which could easily be broken, or crushed (the word in the original is συντρίψασα so as to allow of a free escape for the unguent. The ointment was made of spikenard νάρδου πιστικῆς). The Vulgate has nardi spicati. If this is the true interpretation of the word πιστικῆς, it would mean that this ointment was made from a bearded plant mentioned by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:12), who says that the ointment made from this plant was most precious. The plant was called by Galen \"nardi spica.\" Hence πιστικῆν it would mean \"genuine\" ointment - ointment made from the flowers of the choicest kind of plant, pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:26) says that there was an inferior article in circulation, which he calls \"pseudo-nard.\" The Syriac Peshito Version uses an expression which means the principal, or best kind of ointment. The anointing of the head would be the more usual mark of honor. It would seem most probable that Mary first wiped the feet of Jesus, wetting them with her tears, and then wiping off the dust, and then anointing them; and that she then proceeded to break the neck of the cruse, and to pour its whole contents on his head.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But there were some that had indignation - the word in the original is ἀγανακτοῦντες, ached with vexation - among themselves. St. Mark says, \"there were some;\" avoiding any more particular mention of them. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:8) says that the disciples generally had indignation. The murmuring seems to have been general. At length it found a definite expression in Judas Iscariot (see John 12:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred pence, and given to the poor. Three hundred pence would amount to about £10 12s. 6d. of English money. It appears from St. John (John 13:29) that the wants of the poor were carefully attended to by our Lord and his disciples. And they murmured against her ἐνεβριμῶντο); another very expressive verb in the original, they growled at her; rebuked her vehemently.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - It appears from St. John (John 12:7) that our Lord here addressed himself pointedly to Judas in the words, Let her alone;... she hath wrought a good work on me, a work worthy of all praise and honor. \"What,\" says Cornelius a Lapide, \"what more noble, than to anoint the feet of him who is both God and man? Who would not count himself happy, if it were permitted to him to touch the feet of Jesus and to kiss them?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Far ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can (δύνασθε) do them good: but me ye have not always. The little clause, \"whensoever ye will ye can do them good,\" occurs only in St. Mark. It is as though our Lord said, \"The world always abounds with poor; therefore you always have it in your power to help them; but within a week I shall have gone from you, after which you will be unable to perform any service like this for me; yea, no more to see, to hear, to touch me. Suffer, then, this woman to perform this ministry now for me, which after six days she will have no other opportunity of doing.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - She hath done what she could. She seized the opportunity, which might not occur again, of doing honor to her Lord by anointing him with her very best. Our Lord might have excused this action, and have praised it as a practical evidence of her gratitude, her humility, and her love for him. But instead of dwelling on these things, he said, She hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying. Our Lord here, of course, alludes to the spices and ointments with which the Jews wrapped up the bodies of their dead before their burial. Not that this was what Mary intended. She could hardly have dreamed of his death and burial so near at hand. But she was moved by the Holy Spirit to do this, at this particular time, as though in anticipation of his death and burial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her (εἰς μνημόσυνον αὐτῆς). \"Mnemosyne was the mother of the Muses, and so called because, before the invention of writing, a retentive memory was of the utmost value in every effort of literary genius\" (Dr. Morison on St. Mark). When our Lord delivered this prediction, none of the Gospels had been written; nor bad the gospel been preached at this time throughout the then known world. Now it has been published for more than eighteen centuries; and wherever, it is proclaimed, this deed of Mary's is published with it, in continual memory of her, and to her lasting honor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve (ὁ εῖς τῶν δώδεκα), went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them. The betrayal follows immediately after the anointing by Mary. We may suppose that the other disciples who had murmured on account of this waste of the ointment, were brought to their senses by our Lord's rebuke, and felt its force. But with Judas the case was very different. The rebuke, which had a salutary effect on them, only served to harden him. He had lost one opportunity of gain; he would seek another. In his cupidity and wickedness he resolves to betray his Master, and sell him to the Jews. So while the chief priests were plotting how they might destroy him, they found an apt and unexpected instrument for their purpose in one of his own disciples. Judas came to them, and the vile and hateful bargain was concluded. It marks the tremendous iniquity of the transaction that it was \"one of the twelve\" who betrayed him - not one of the seventy, but one of those who were in the closest intimacy and nearness to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought (ἐζήτει) - he was seeking; he made it his business to arrange how the infamous plot might be managed - how he might conveniently deliver him unto them (πῶς εὐκαίρως αὐτὸν παραδῷ); literally, how at a convenient season he might betray him. And they,when they heard it, were glad; glad, because they saw the prospect of the accomplishment of their wishes; glad, because it was \"one of the twelve\" who covenanted to betray him. They promised to give him money. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:15) tells us the amount, namely, thirty pieces of silver, according to the prophecy of Zechariah (Zechariah 11:12), to which St. Matthew evidently refers. These pieces of silver were shekels of the sanctuary, worth about three shillings each. This would make the whole amount about £4 10s. of our money; less than half the value of the precious ointment with which Mary had anointed him. Some commentators, however, think that this was only an instalment of what they promised him if he completed his treasonable design. How he might conveniently deliver him unto them. St. Luke (Luke 22:6) explains this by saying, \"in the absence of the multitude;\" that is, when the people were not about him, and when he was in private with his disciples. And so he betrayed him at night, when he was alone with his disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover? The first day of unleavened bread would begin on the evening of the Thursday (the 14th day of the month Nisan). Where wilt thou that we prepare? They do not inquire in what city or town. The Passover could not be sacrificed anywhere but in Jerusalem. The question was in what house it was to be prepared.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And he sendeth two of his disciples. St. Luke (Luke 22:8) informs us that these two were Peter and John. It is characteristic of St. Mark's Gospel throughout that Peter is never mentioned oftener than is necessary. Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water. The bearing of the pitcher of water was not without its meaning. It was a solemn religious act preparatory to the Passover. This man bearing a pitcher of water was not the master or owner of the house. The owner is distinguished afterwards by the name οἰκοδέσποτης, or \"goodman of the house.\" The owner must, therefore, have been a man of some substance, and probably a friend if not a disciple of our Lord. Tradition says that this was the house of John whose surname was Mark; and that it was in this house that the disciples were assembled on the evening of our Lord's resurrection, and where, also, they received the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, on the day of Pentecost. It was to this house that Peter betook himself when he was delivered by the angel out of prison. Hence it was known, as one of the earliest places of Christian worship, by the name of \"Coenaculum Sion; \"and here was built a church, called the Church of Sion. It was the oldest church in Jerusalem, and was called by St. Cyril, \"the upper church of the apostles.\" (See Joseph Mode, p. 322.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Master saith, Where is my guest-chamber (κατύλυμα μοῦ); literally, my lodging.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. He himself, that is, the goodman of the house; perhaps John Mark. This upper room was furnished and ready (ἐστρωμένον ἕτοιμον); furnished, that is, with table and couches and tapestry, and in all respects ready for the purpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. And they made ready the passover. This would consist in obtaining the Paschal lamb, and taking it to the temple to be sacrificed by the priests. It would then be brought to the house to be cooked; and the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs and the wine would have to be provided, and the water for purification. After all these preparations had been made, the two disciples would return to their Master.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the evening he cometh with the twelve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve. It was in the evening that the lamb was to be eaten. Peter and John having returned from their preparation, the twelve (including Judas Iscariot) all went back with their Master to Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with me (ὁ ἐσθίων μετ ἐμοῦ). Much had doubtless happened before our Lord said this; but St. Mark only records the important circumstances. These words of our Lord were uttered with great solemnity. The presence of the traitor was a burden upon his spirit, and cast a gloom over this usually joyous festival. A question here arises whether Judas remained to partake of the Holy Communion when our Lord instituted it. The greater number of the Fathers, and amongst them Origen, St. Cyril, St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and Bede, consider that he was present; and Dionysius says that our Lord's words to him, \"That thou doest, do quickly,\" were intended to separate him from the rest of the twelve as one who had partaken unworthily; and that then it was that Satan entered into him, and impelled him onwards to this terrible sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? The disciples were naturally disposed to be joyful at this great festival. But their Master's sorrow and his words, and the solemnity with which they were uttered, cast a shadow over the whole company; and the disciples began to be sorrowful. The words, \"And another said, Is it I?\" are omitted by the best authorities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And he said unto them, It is one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish. St. Mark here uses the present participle (ὁ ἐμβαπτόμενος), bringing the action close to the time when he was speaking. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:23) has (ὁ ἐμβάψας) \"he that dipped his hand,\" using the aorist form. St. Mark's form is the more graphic. The dish probably contained a sauce called charoseth, into which they dipped their food before eating it. The following appears to have been the order of the events: - First, our Lord, before he instituted the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, foretold that he would be betrayed by one of his disciples but only in general terms. Then came the eager question from them, \"Is it I?\" Then Christ answered that the traitor was he who should dip his hand together with him in the dish. But this did not bring it home to the individual, because several who sat near to him were able to dip with him in the dish. So that our Lord had as yet only obscurely and indefinitely pointed out the traitor. Then he proceeded to institute \"the Lord's Supper;\" after which he again intimated (Luke 22:21) that \"the hand of him that betrayed him was with him on the table.\" Upon this. St. Peter hinted to St. John, who was \"reclining in Jesus' besom,\" that he should ask him to say definitely and by name who it was that should betray him. Our Lord then said to St. John, \"He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him\" (John 13:26). Our Lord then dipped the sop, and gave it to Judas Iscariot. Then it was that our Lord said to Judas, \"That thou doest, do quickly\" (ὅ ποιεῖς ποίησον τάχιον) (John 13:27). Then Judas went straightway to the house of Caiaphas, and procured the band of men and officers for the completion of his horrible design.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For the Son of man goeth (ὑπάγει) - goeth, departeth from this mortal scene: the reference is, of course, to his death - even as it is written of him; as, for example, in Psalm 22 and Isaiah 41 It was foreordained by God that he was to suffer as a victim for the sins of the whole world. But this predestined purpose of God did not make the guilt any the less of those who brought the Savior to his cross. Good were it for that man if he had not been born. The Greek is καλὸν η΅ν αὐτῷ εἰ οὐκ ἐγεννήθη ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος: literally, good were it for him, if that man had not been born. Better not to have lived at all than to have lived and died ill. Existence is no blessing, but a curse, to him who consciously and wilfully defeats the purpose of his existence. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:25) here introduces Judas as asking the question, \"Is it I, Rabbi?\" And our Lord answers him affirmatively, \"Thou hast said.\" This was probably said in a low voice. Had it been said so as to be heard by others, such as Peter and John, they might have risen at once to inflict summary vengeance upon the apostate traitor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The last clause of this verse should be read thus: Take ye: this is my body (Λάβετε τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ σῶμά μοῦ). The institution of this Holy Sacrament took place at the close of the Paschal supper, but while they were yet at the table. The bread which our Lord took would most likely be unleavened bread. But this does not surely constitute a reason why unleavened bread should be used ordinarily in the celebration of the Holy Communion. The direction of the Prayer-book of the English Church is wise and practical, \"It shall suffice that the Bread be such as is usual to be eaten.\" This is my body; that is, sacramentally. St. Augustine ('Sermo.,' 272) says, \"How is the bread his body? and the cup, or that which the cup contains, how is that his blood? These are, therefore, called sacraments, because in them one thing is seen while another thing is understood\" (quoted by Dr. Morison, p. 392).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And he took a cup. There is no definite article either here or in St. Matthew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - This is my blood of the covenant. There is not sufficient authority for the retaining of the word \"new\" (καινῆς) in the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I will no more, drink (οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ πίω) of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. It is observable that our Lord here calls the wine \"the fruit (γέννημα) of the vine,\" after be has spoken of it as sacramentally his blood. Our Lord here refers to the time of the regeneration of all things, when the heavenly kingdom shall appear in the fullness of its glory; and when his disciples, who now feed upon him sacramentally and by faith, shall then eat at his table in his kingdom, and drink of the river of his pleasures for ever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives. Some suppose that this was one particular hymn out of the Jewish service-books appointed for use at the close of the Paschal supper. The word in the Greek is simply ὑμνήσαντες. What they sang was more probably the Hallel, consisting of six psalms, from Psalm 108, to Psalm 118, inclusive. They went out unto the Mount of Olives. It was our Lord's custom, in these last days of his earthly life, to go daily to Jerusalem, and teach in the temple, and in the evening to return to Bethany and sup; and then after supper to retire to the Mount of Olives, and there to spend the night in prayer (Luke 21:37). But on this occasion he did not return to Bethany. He had supped in Jerusalem. Besides, he knew that his hour was come. So he voluntarily put himself into the way of the traitor (John 18:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - All ye shall be offended. The words which follow in the Authorized Version, \"because of me this night,\" are not to be found in the best manuscripts and versions. They appear to have been imported from St. Matthew. Shall be offended (σκανδαλισθήσεσθε); literally, shall be caused to stumble. Our Lord was to prove \"a stone of stumbling\" to many, not excluding his own disciples. Even they, under the influence of terror, would for a time lose confidence and hope in him. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad. This is a quotation from Zechariah (Zechariah 13:7), \"Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd, and against the man that is my Fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the Shepherd.\" This passage brings out in a remarkable manner the Divine agency in the death of Christ. The sheep shall be scattered abroad. The disciples all forsook him and fled, when they saw him actually in the hands of his enemies. They felt doubtful for the moment whether he was indeed the Son of God. \"They trusted that it was he who should redeem Israel;\" but now their hopes gave way to fear and doubt. They fled hither and thither like frightened sheep. But God gathered them together again, so that when our Lord rose from the dead, he found them all in the same place; and then he revived their faith and courage. Our Lord and his disciples had no settled home or friends in Jerusalem; so they had no other place to flee to than that upper chamber, where, not long before, Christ had kept the Passover with them. The owner of that house was a friend; so thither they went, and there Christ appeared to them after his resurrection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee. This our Lord said to reassure them. Galilee was more like home to them than Jerusalem, and they would there be less afraid of the unbelieving Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. Our Lord had just distinctly stated that they would all be offended, and therefore these words of St. Peter were very presumptuous. Conscious of his own infirmities, he ought to have said, \"I know that through my own infirmity this may easily happen. Nevertheless, I trust to thy mercy and goodness to save me.\" Just such is the Christian's daily experience. We often think that we are strong in the faith, strong in purity, strong in patience. But when temptation arises, we falter and fall. The true remedy against temptation is the consciousness of our own weakness, and supplication for Divine strength.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Verily I say unto thee, that thou to-day, even this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice. The day had begun. It began at six in the evening. It was already advanced. This second crowing of the cock is mentioned by St. Mark only; and it forms an additional aggravation of Peter's sin. The \"cockcrowing\" was a term used for one of the divisions of the night (see Mark 13:35). But it appears that there were three times at which the cock-crowing might be expected - namely,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) early in the night, between eleven and twelve;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) between one and two; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) between five and six.NEWLINENEWLINEThe two cock crowings here referred to would be the two last of the three here mentioned. It would probably be about 2 a.m., when the first trial of our Lord took place in the house of Caiaphas.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - But he spake exeseding vehemently (ἐκπερισσῶς ἐλάλει), If I must die with thee (ἐάν με δέρ), I will not deny thee. The right reading (ἐλάλει, imperfect) implies that he kept asserting over and over again. He was, no doubt, sincere in all this, but he had vet to learn his own weakness. St. Hilary says on this, \"Peter was so carried away by the fervor of his zeal and love for Christ, that he regarded neither the weakness of his own flesh nor the truth of his Master's word.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And they come (ἔρχονται) - here again St. Mark's present gives force to the narrative - unto a place which was named Gethsemane. A place (χωρίον) is, literally, an enclosed piece of ground, generally with a cottage upon it. Josephus tells us that these gardens were numerous in the suburbs of Jerusalem. St. Jerome says that \"Gethsemane was at the foot of the Mount of Olives.\" St. John (John 18:1) calls it a garden, or orchard (κῆπος). The word \"Gethsemane\" means literally \"the place of the olive-press,\" whither the olives which abounded on the slopes of the mountain were brought, in order that the oil contained in them might be pressed out. The exact position of Gethsemane is not known; although there is an enclosed spot at the foot of the western slope of the Mount of Olives which is called to this day El maniye. The real Gethsemane cannot be far from this spot. Our Lord resorted to this place for retirement and prayer, not as desiring to escape the death that awaited him. It was well known to be his favourite resort; so that he went there, as though to put himself in the way of Judas, who would naturally seek him there. Sit ye here, while I pray. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:36) says, \"While I go yonder and pray.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - It appears that our Lord separated himself from all the disciples except Peter and James and John, and then the bitter agony began. He began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled (e)kqambei = sqai kai  a)dhmonei = n). These two Greek verbs are as adequately expressed above as seems possible. The first implies \"utter, extreme amazement;\" if the second has for its root ἄδημος, \"not at home,\" it implies the anguish of the soul struggling to free itself from the body under the pressure of intense mental distress. The three chosen disciples were allowed to be witnesses of this awful anguish. They had been fortified to endure the sight by the glories of the transfiguration. It would have been too much for the faith of the rest. But these three witnessed it, that they might learn themselves, and be able to teach others, that the way to glory is by suffering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - None but he who bore those sorrows can know what they were. It was not the apprehension of the bodily torments and the bitter death that awaited him, all foreknown by him. It was the inconceivable agony of the weight of the sins of men. The Lord was thus laying \"upon him the iniquity of us all.\" This, and this alone, can explain it. My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death. Every word carries the emphasis of an overwhelming grief. It was then that \"the deep waters came in,\" even unto his soul. \"What,\" says Cornelius a Lapide, \"must have been the voice, the countenance, the expression, as he uttered those awful words!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Our Lord now separated himself, though apparently, as St. Luke (Luke 22:41) says, only \"about a stone's cast\" from the three disciples, and threw himself on the ground in mortal agony, and prayed that this hour of his supreme mental anguish might, if possible, pass from him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And he said, Abba, Father. Some commentators suppose that our Lord only used the Hebrew or Aramaic word \"Abba,\" and that St. Mark adds the Greek and Latin synonym (πατὴρ) for the benefit of those to whom he was writing. But it is far more natural to conclude that St. Mark is here taking his narrative from an eye and ear witness, St. Peter; and that both the words were uttered by him; so that he thus, in his agony, cried to God in the name of the whole human family, the Jew first, and also the Gentile. We can quite understand why St. Matthew, writing to Jews, gives only the Hebrew word. All things are possible unto thee. Speaking absolutely, with God nothing is impossible. But the Deity is himself bound by his own laws; and hence this was impossible, consistently with his purposes of mercy for the redemption of the world. The Lord himself knew this. Therefore he does not ask for anything contrary to the will of his Father. But it was the natural craving of his humanity, which, subject to the supreme will of God, desired to be delivered from this terrible load. Remove this cup from me. The \"cup,\" both in Holy Scripture and in profane writers, is taken to signify that lot or portion, whether good or evil, which is appointed for us by God. Hence St. John is frequently represented as holding a cup. Howbeit, not what I will, but what thou wilt. Our Lord has no sooner offered his conditional prayer than he subordinates it to the will of God. St. Luke (Luke 22:42) here says, \"Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.\" Hence it appears that there was not, as the Monothelites taught, one will, partly human and partly Divine, in Christ; but there were two distinct wills, one human and the other Divine, both residing in the one Christ; and it was by the subjecting of his human will to the Divine that he wrought out our redemption.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch one hour? St. Luke says (Luke 22:45) that they were \"sleeping for sorrow.\" So on the Mount of Transfiguration he says (Luke 9:32) that they were \"heavy with sleep.\" This rebuke, which St. Mark tells us here was pointedly addressed to Peter, seems to glance at his earnest protestations of fidelity made not long before. And our Lord calls him by his old name of Simon. In St. Matthew (Matthew 26:40) it is less pointed; for there, while our Lord looks at Peter, he addresses them all. \"He saith unto -Peter, What, could not ye watch with me one hour?\" This is just one of those graphic little incidents which we may suppose St. Mark to have received directly from St. Peter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWatch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The great temptation of the disciples at that moment was to deny Christ under the influence of fear. And so our Lord gives here the true remedy against temptation of every kind; namely, watchfulness and prayer - watchfulness, against the craft and subtlety of the devil or man; and prayer, for the Divine help to overcome. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Here our Lord graciously finds excuses for them. It is as though he said, \"I know that in heart and mind you are ready to cleave to me, even though the Jews should threaten you with death. But I know also that your flesh is weak. Pray, then, that the weakness of the flesh may not overcome the strength of the spirit.\" St. Jerome says, \"In whatever degree we trust to the ardor of the spirit, in the same degree ought we to fear because of the infirmity of the flesh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Saying the same words. The repetition of the same words shows his fixed determination to submit to the will of his heavenly Father. Although the human nature at first asserted itself in the prayer that the cup might pass from him; yet ultimately the human will yielded to the Divine. He desired to drink this cup of bitterness appointed for him by the will of God; for his supreme desire was that the will of God might be done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy (καταβαρυνόμενοι): literally, weighed down. They had not deliberately yielded themselves to sleep; but an oppressive languor, the effect of great sorrow, had come over them, so that they could not watch as they desired to do; but by an involuntary action they ever and anon slumbered. They wist not what to answer him. They had no excuse, save that which he himself had found for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough (ἀπέχει); the hour is come. Some have thought that our Lord here uses the language of irony. But it is far more consistent with his usual considerate words to suppose that, sympathizing with the infirmity of his disciples, he simply advised them, now that his bitter agony was over, to take some rest during the brief interval that remained. It is enough. Some commentators have thought that the somewhat difficult Greek verb (ἀπέχει) would be better rendered, he is at a distance; as though our Lord meant to say, \"There is yet time for you to take some rest. The betrayer is some distance off.\" Such an interpretation would require a full. stop between the clause now rendered, \"it is enough,\" and the clause, \"the hour is come;\" so that the passage would read, \"Sleep on now, and take your rest; he (that is, Judas) is yet a good way off.\" Then there would be an interval; and then our Lord would rouse them up with the words, \"The hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\" This interpretation all hangs upon the true rendering of the word ἀπέχει, which, although it might be taken to. mean \"he,\" or \"it is distant,\" is nevertheless quite capable of the ordinary interpretation, \"it sufficeth.\" According to the high authority of Hesychius, who explains it by the words ἀπόχρη and ἐξαρκεῖ, it seems safer on the whole to accept the ordinary meaning, \"It is enough.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And straightway, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve. How the stupendous crime is here marked! It was so startling a fact that \"one of the twelve\" should be the betrayer of cur Lord, that this designation of Judas became linked with his name: \"Judas, one of the twelve.\" He comes not only as a thief and a robber, but also as a traitor; the leader of those who were thirsting for Christ's blood. St. Luke (Luke 22:47) says that Judas \"went before them,\" in his eagerness to accomplish his hateful errand. And with him a multitude (not a great multitude; the word πολὺς has not sufficient authority). But though not a great multitude, they would be a considerable number. There would be a band of soldiers; and there would be civil officers sent by the Sanhedrim. Thus Gentiles and Jews were united in the daring act of arresting the Son of God. St. John (John 18:3) says that they had \"lanterns and torches;\" although the moon was at the full.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsosver I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely. Why was Judas so anxious that Christ should be secured? Perhaps because he feared a rescue, or because he feared lest our Lord should hide himself by an exercise of his miraculous power; and so Judas might lose the thirty pieces of silver.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him (κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν); literally, kissed him much. The kiss was an ancient mode of salutation amongst the Jews, the Romans, and other nations. It is possible that this was the usual mode with which the disciples greeted Christ when they returned to him after any absence. But Judas abused this token of friendship, using it for a base and treacherous purpose. St. Chrysostom says that he felt assured by the gentleness of Christ that he would not repel him, or that, if he did, the treacherous action would have answered its purpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they laid their hands on him, and took him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear (ἀφεῖλεν αὐτοῦ τὸ ὠτίον). We learn from St. John (John 18:10) that this was Peter. St. John also is the only evangelist who mentions the name (Malchus) of the high priest's servant. Malchus would probably be prominent amongst them. St. Luke (Luke 22:51) is the only evangelist who mentions the healing of the wound by our Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - We learn from St. Matthew (Matthew 26:52) that our Lord rebuked his disciples for their resistance; after which he proceeded to rebuke those who were bent upon apprehending him. Are ye come out, as against a robber (ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν), with swords and staves to seize me? The order of events in the betrayal appears to have been this: First, the kiss of the traitor Judas, by which he indicated to those who were with him which was Jesus. Then follows that remarkable incident mentioned only by St. John (John 18:4-6), \"Jesus... went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, was standing with them. When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.\" The presence of Christ in his serene majesty overpowered them. There was something in his looks and manner, as he repeated these words,\" I am he,\" words often used before by him, that caused them to retreat backwards, and to prostrate themselves. It was no external force that produced this result. The Divine majesty flashed from his countenance and overawed them, at least for the moment. At all events, it was an emphatic evidence, both to his own disciples and to this crowd, that it was by his own will that he yielded himself up to them. Perhaps this incident fired the courage of St. Peter; and so, as they approached to take our Lord, he drew his sword and struck off the ear of Malchus. Then our Lord healed him. And then he turned to the multitude and said, \"Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves, to seize me?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - But this is done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. This, as it stands in the original, is an incomplete sentence; in St. Matthew (Matthew 26:56) the sentence occurs in its complete form. In both cases it has been questioned whether the words are those of our Lord, or whether they are the comment of the evangelist. On the whole, it would seem more probable that they are our Lord's words, which seem almost required to conclude what he had said before.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they all forsook him, and fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - And they all left him, and fled. But soon afterwards two of them, Peter and John, took courage, and followed him to the house of the high priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him. St. Mark is the only evangelist who mentions this incident; and there seems good reason for supposing that he here describes what happened to himself. Such is the mode in which St. John refers to himself in his Gospel, and where there can be no doubt that he is speaking of himself. If the conclusion in an earlier part of this commentary be correct, that it was at the house to which John Mark belonged that our Lord celebrated the Passover, and from whence he went out to the Mount of Olives; what more probable than that Mark had been with him on that occasion, and had perhaps a presentiment that something was about to happen to him? What more likely than that the crowd who took Jesus may have passed by this house, and that Mark may have been roused from his bed (it was now a late hour) by the tumult. Having a linen cloth (σινδόνα) cast about his naked body. The sindon was a fine linen cloth, indicating that he belonged to a family in good circumstances. It is an unusual word. In every other place of the New Testament where it is used it refers to the garment or shroud used to cover the bodies of the dead. The sindon is supposed to take its name from Sidon, where the particular kind of linen was manufactured of which the garment was made. It was a kind of light cloak frequently worn in hot weather.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - But he left the linen cloth, and fled naked. This somewhat ignominious flight is characteristic of what we know of St. Mark. It shows how great was the panic in reference to Christ, and how great was the hatred of the Jews against him, that they endeavored to seize a young man who was merely following with him. It shows also how readily our Lord's enemies would have seized his own disciples if they had not taken refuge in flight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - And they led Jesus away to the high priest. This high priest was Caiaphas. But we learn from St. John (John 18:13) that our Lord was first brought before Annas, the father-in-law of Caiphas. Annas and his five sons held the high priesthood in succession, Caiaphas, his son-in-law, stepping in between the first and the second son, and holding the office for twelve years. It is supposed that it was in the house of Annas that the price of the betrayal was paid to Judas. Annas, though not then high priest, must have had considerable influence in the counsels of the Sanhedrim; and this will probably explain the fact of our Lord having been first taken to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court (εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν) of the high priest. This court was the place where the guards and servants of the high priest were assembled. Our Lord was within, in a large room, being arraigned before the council. St. John informs us (John 18:15) that he himself, being known to the high priest, had gone in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; and that he had been the means of bringing in Peter, who had been standing outside at the door leading into the court. We now see Peter among the servants, crouching over the fire. The weather was cold, for it was early springtime; and it was now after midnight. Peter was warming himself in the light of the fire (πρὸς τὸ φῶς), and so his features were clearly seen in the glow of the brightly burning charcoal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death, and found it not. Their supreme object was to put him to death; but. they wished to accomplish their object in a manner consistent with their own honor, so as not to appear to have put him to death without reason. So they sought for false witnesses against him, that they might deliver the Author of life and the Savior of the world to death. For in real truth, although they knew it not, and were the instruments in his hands, he had determined by the death of Christ to bestow on us both present and eternal life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together. Whatever things these witnesses brought forward were either false, or self-contradictory, or beside the purpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 57, 58. - And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:60) says that they were two. What our Lord had really said was this - we read it in St. John (John 2:19) - \"Destroy this temple; and in three days I will raise it up.\" These words the false witnesses perverted; for they assigned to Jesus the work of destruction which he left to the Jews. He did not say,\" I will destroy;\" but \"Do ye destroy, and I will rebuild.\" Nor did he say, \"I will build another;\" but \"I will raise it up,\" that is, from the dead; for St. John tells us that \"he spake of the temple of his body,\" in which, as in a temple, there dwelt the fullness of the Godhead.. He might have said plainly, \"I will rise from the dead;\" but he chose to speak as in a parable. According to their witness, however, our Lord's words would appear as little more than an empty boast, certainly not as anything on account of which such a charge as they desired could be brought against him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut neither so did their witness agree together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 60, 61. - And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing?... But he held his peace, and answered nothing. The high priest would naturally be seated at the top of the semicircle, with the members of the Sanhedrim on either side of him, and the Accused in front of him. Now he rises from his seat, and comes forward into the midst (εἰς τὸ μέσον), and demands an answer. But Jesus answered nothing. It would have been a long and tedious business to answer such a charge, which involved a garbled and inaccurate statement of what he had said. It would have answered no good purpose to reply to an accusation so vague and inaccurate. Our Lord knew that, whatever his answer was, it would be twisted so as to make against him. Silence was therefore the most dignified treatment of such an accusation. Besides, he knew that his hour was come. The high priest now asks him plainly, Art thou the Christ, the son of the Blessed? Here he touches the point of the whole matter. Christ had frequently declared himself to be such. Caiaphas, therefore, now asks the question, not because he needed the information, but that he might condemn him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 62. - To this question our Lord returns a plain and candid answer, out of reverence for the Divine Name which, as St. Matthew and St. Luke tell us, had been invoked by the high priest, and also respect for the office of the high priest, by whom he had been put upon his oath. St. Chrysostom says that our Lord answered thus that he might leave without excuse all those who listened to him, who would not hereafter be able to plead in the day of judgment that, when our Lord was solemnly asked in the council whether he was the Son of God, he had either refused to answer, or had answered evasively. This answer of our Lord is full of majesty and sublimity. He is arraigned as a criminal, standing in the midst of the chief priests and scribes,his bitter enemies; and it is as though he said, \"You, O Caiaphas, and you the chief priests and elders of the Jews, are now unjustly condemning me as a false prophet and a false Christ; but the day is at hand when I, who am now a prisoner at your judgment seat, shall sit on the throne of glory as the Judge of you and of all mankind. You are now about to condemn me to the death of the cross; but I shall then sit in judgment upon you, and condemn you for this terrible guilt of slaying me, who am the true God and the Judge of the world.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:63VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 63. - And the high priest rent his clothes (διαῥῤήξας τοὺς χιτῶνας); literally, his tunics.; St. Matthew (Matthew 26:65) has τὰ ἱμὰτια literally, his garments. None but people of rank wore two tunics. The Greek verb here rendered \"rent\" implies violent dramatic action. The Jewish tunic was open under the chin, and large enough to receive the head, so that it could easily be placed over the shoulders, by inserting the head. When the wearer wished to give this sign of indignation or grief, he would seize the garment at this opening with both hands, and violently tear it asunder down to the waist. But it was unlawful for the high priest to do this in a private grief (Leviticus 10:6). Some of the Fathers think that by this action Caiaphas involuntarily typified the rending of the priesthood from himself and from the Jewish nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:64VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 64. - They all condemned him to be worthy of death (ἔνοχον θανάτου). There were, therefore, none there but those who were known to be opposed to our Lord. It will be remembered that all these proceedings were illegal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:65VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 65. - And some began to spit on him. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:67) says, \"Then did they spit in his face.\" That Divine face, to be reverenced and adored by every creature, was exposed to this vile contumely; and he bore it patiently. \"I hid not my face from shame and spitting\" (Isaiah 1:61). And the officers received him with blows of their hands (οἱ ὑπηρέται ῤαπίσμασιν αὐτὸν ἔλαβον).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:66VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 66. - And as Peter was beneath in the court. The room in which the Sanhedrim were assembled was an upper chamber.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:67VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 67. - And seeing (ἰδοψ῀σα) Peter warming himself, she looked upon him (ἐμβλέψασα αὐτῷ). She looked upon him, in the light of the fire, so as to see his features distinctly. This was one of the menial servants who attended to the outer door of the court, and perhaps had been the one to let in Peter; so that she could say with some confidence, Thou wast also with the Nazarene, even Jesus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:68VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 68. - But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest. \"This shows the great terror of Peter,\" says St. Chrysostom, \"who, intimidated by the question of a poor servant-girl, denied his Lord; and who yet afterwards, when he had received the Holy Spirit, could say, 'We ought to obey God rather than man.'\" I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest. Every word here is emphatic. It amounts to this: \"So little do I know who this Jesus is, that I know not what you say or what you ask concerning him. I know not who or what he is or anything about him. A question has been raised as to the number of times that Peter denied our Lord. The narratives are best explained by the consideration that all the denials took place in the house of Caiaphas. Furthermore, the accounts of the evangelists may be reconciled thus: First, Peter denied the Lord in the court of the high priest, when he was first asked by the maidservant, as he sat over the fire (Matthew 24:69); secondly, he denied him with an oath; thirdly, when urged still more, he denied him with many oaths and execrations. The cock crew the first time after the first denial, when we read (Matthew 26:71) that he went out into the porch (προαύλιον). This crowing would be about one or two in the morning. The second crowing would not be until five or six. This shows us the length of time that the proceedings lasted. It was doubtless as Jesus through the court that he gave Peter that look of unutterable pain and grief which moved him at once to repentance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:69VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:70VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:71VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark14:72VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 72. - And when he thought thereon, he wept (καὶ ἐπὶβαλὼν ἔκλαιε, not ἔκλαυςε,). The word implies a long and continued weeping. This concludes the preliminary trial, the whole proceedings of which were illegal.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate. Straightway in the morning (εὐθέως πρωι'´). The proceedings recorded in the last chapter terminated probably between five and six; the cock-crowing helps to fix the time. Now came the more formal trial. The whole Sanhedrim united in consultation. All the proceedings hitherto had been irregular and illegal. Now, for form's sake, they tried him afresh. But there was another law which was also violated. It was now Friday. In capital cases, sentence of condemnation might not legally be pronounced on the day of the trial. Yet our Lord was tried, condemned, and crucified on the same day. They \"hound him,\" that he might be impeded in any attempt to escape. They \"carried him away\" (ἀπήνεγκαν), with the semblance of force; although we know that he went \"as a lamb to the slaughter.\" How truly might it be said of these chief priests and elders, \"Their feet are swift to shed blood!\" And delivered him up to Pilate. Judaea now was added to the province of Syria, and governed by procurators, of whom Pontius Pilate was the fifth. It was necessary for the Jews to deliver Christ over to the Roman power; because the power of life and death had been taken from them since they became subject to the Romans. \"It is not lawful for us,\" they say (John 18:31) \"to put any man to death;\" that is to say, they could not put to death without the authority of the governor. Our Lord predicted of himself, \"They shall deliver him to the Gentiles.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Art thou the King of the Jews? It appears from St. Luke (Luke 23:1-5) that when Pilate demanded particularly what the charges against Jesus were, on account of which the Jews urged that he should be crucified, they alleged these three things:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that he perverted the nation;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he forbade to give tribute to Caesar;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that he said that he was Christ, a King.NEWLINENEWLINEWhereupon Pilate, who had heard by many of the blameless life, the pure doctrine, and the famous miracles of Jesus, goes at once to the point, and asks him, \"Art thou the King of the Jews?\" - a question which, of course, affected the position of Caesar. Our Lord's answer, Thou sayest (σὺ λέγεις), was in the affirmative, amounting to this \"Thou sayest that which is true.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the chief priests accused him of many things. The words in the Authorized Version, \"but he answered nothing,\" are not to be found here in any of the best manuscripts or versions. But they are to be found in St. Matthew (Matthew 27:12); and Pilate's question in the next verse confirms St. Matthew's statement, and makes the sentence unnecessary here. Our Lord answered nothing, because all that they had to say against him was manifestly false or frivolous, and unworthy of any reply. St. Augustine says on this, \"The Savior, who is the Wisdom of God, knew how to overcome by keeping silence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - It would seem that Pilate had led Jesus out of his palace, into which the Jewish priests could not enter (John 18:28), lest they should be defiled by entering a house from which all leaven had not been scrupulously removed. This would have been a violation of their religious scruples; and therefore he went out into the open court, and there heard the accusations of the chief priests. It is supposed that the building occupied by Pilate was the palace built or rebuilt by Herod near the gate of Jaffa, north-west of Mount Zion. It was doubtless occasionally occupied by Pilate, and it was conveniently situated, being near to Herod's palace - the old palace of the Asmoneans, between it and the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Pilate marvelled. He marvelled that the innocent Savior, wise and eloquent, standing before him in peril of his life, should remain silent when thus vehemently accused by the leading men of the Jews. Pilate marvelled at his forbearance, his calmness, his contempt of death; from all of which he argued his absolute innocence and holiness, and resolved to do everything in his power to deliver him. The silence of a blameless life pleads more powerfully than any defense, however elaborate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - St. Mark omits here what took place next in the order of events, namely, the sending of our Lord by Pilate to Herod (Luke 23:5). This was Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee; and Pilate, apparently convinced of our Lord's innocence, hoped to escape the responsibility of condemning an innocent man, by handing him over to Herod; for Pilate had heard that our Lord was a Galilean. Moreover, he hoped to accomplish another good result, namely, to recover the favor of Herod, which was desirable on political grounds. The first intention failed; for Herod sent our Lord back to Pilate in mockery, \"arraying him in gorgeous apparel\" (περιβαλὼν ἐσθῆτα λαμπρὰν). But the second succeeded: \"Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day\" (Luke 23:12). There was now, however, another resource. At the feast (κατα ἑορτὴν) - literally, at feast-time - he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him ὅνπερ ἠτοῦντο). In St. John (John 18:39) we read that Pilate said, \"Ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the Passover.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. Pilate appears to have thought of Barabbas, not doubting but that, by limiting their choice between him and Jesus, he would secure the liberation of our Lord. But Pilate little knew the temper of the chief priests and scribes, and their bitter hostility to Christ. The word \"Barabbas,\" better written \"Bar-Abbas,\" means \"son of father.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the multitude went up and Began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them. Went up (ἀναβὰς). This is the reading to be preferred to the old reading, \"crying aloud\" (ἀναβοήσας). The reading ἀναβὰς is supported by the Sinaitic, the Vatican, and the Cambridge manuscripts; also by the Old Italic, the Gothic, and other versions. The AEthiopic Version combines the two,\" going up and crying aloud.\" The geographical position of Pilate's residence quite justifies the use of the termNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Pilate doubtless hoped that they would ask for Jesus. He knew that the chief priests had delivered our Lord for envy. That he could not help observing, as a shrewd Roman judge, from their gestures and manner. And then he knew also, at least by report, of the purity of Jesus, and of the holy freedom with which he rebuked their vices. So he thought, reasonably enough, that if the chief priests wished to destroy him for envy, the people, who had experienced so many kindnesses from him, would desire that he should live.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Envy was the low passion that influenced the chief priests. They saw that Jesus was gaining a great and increasing influence over the people by the sublime beauty of his character, by the fame of his miracles, and the constraining power of his words. And hence they concluded that, unless he was arrested in his course, and put out of the way, their own influence would soon be gone. The whole world was going after him. Therefore he must be destroyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But the chief priests stirred up the multitude (ἀνέσεισαν τὸν ὄχλον), that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. St. Matthew (Matthew 27:20) says, \"They persuaded the multitudes\" (ἔπεισαν τοὺς ὄχλους). St. Mark's word (ἀνέσεισαν) implies a rousing of their bad passions; agitating them to a blind zeal for his crucifixion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? The word \"again\" has the support of three great uncials, and the best of the cursives. Pilate did not give way without many an inward struggle. And now at last he puts the matter, so to speak, in their own power; so that it might be an act of their clemency, and that they might have the honor of saving our Lord's life. But it was all in vain. For the chief priests had resolved to press for his crucifixion, little dreaming that they were doing what \"God's hand and God's counsel had before determined to be done.\" Pilate puts the question before them with much shrewdness and tact. He speaks of our Lord as one whom \"they called the King of the Jews.\" He appeals to their national pride and their national hopes. Would they degrade themselves, and extinguish their hopes, by giving up to the most ignominious of deaths one who had established such claims upon their reverence and their love?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they cried out again, Crucify him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And they cried out again, Crucify him. These words might seem at first to justify the old reading, in ver. 8, adopted in the Authorized Version,\" crying aloud.\" But there the word was ἀναβοήσας, here it is ἔ᾿κραξαν. Moreover, in ver. 14, it is not (περισσοτέρως) \"the more exceedingly,\" but (περισσῶς) \"they cried exceedingly.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And Pilate, wishing βουλόμενος to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. St. Luke and St. John are more full in details here. From their narratives it appears that when Pilate found that his attempt to rescue our Lord, by putting Barabbas in contrast with him, had failed, he next hoped to move the multitude to pity by the terrible punishment of scourging, after which he trusted that they would relent. Scourging was a vile punishment, inflicted on slaves. But it was also inflicted upon those who were condemned to death, even though freemen This scourging, which was a part of the punishment of crucifixion, was of frightful severity. Horace ('Sat.' 1:3, 119) speaks of it as \"horrible flagellum.\" But it appears from St. John (John 21:1) that the scourging of Jesus took place before his formal condemnation to be crucified; we may therefore suppose that it was not a part of the ordinary punishment of crucifixion. At all events, there is nothing, upon a careful comparison of the narratives, to lead us to the conclusion that our blessed Lord was scourged twice. In fact, Pilate anticipated the time of the scourging, in the vain hope that he might by this means save our Lord from the capital punishment. A comparison of the narratives of St. Matthew and St. Mark with that of St. John will make this clear; for they all three refer to one and the same scourging. Recent investigations at Jerusalem have disclosed what may probably have been the place of the punishment. In a subterranean chamber, discovered by Captain Warren, on what Mr. Fergusson holds to be the site of Antonia, Pilate's praetorium, stands a truncated column, no part of the structure itself, but just such a dwarf pillar as criminals would be tied to to be scourged. The chamber cannot be later than the time of Herod (see Professor Westcott on St. John 19.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. This was the principal court of the palace, where a large number of soldiers were always quartered. \"The whole band\" would be the \"cohors praetoria\" of Cicero; Pilate's body-guard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - And they clothe him with purple, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! They clothe him with purple (ἐνδύουσιν αὐτὸν πορφύραν). So also says St. John (John 21:2, ἱματιον πορφυροῦν). St. Matthew says (Matthew 27:28), \"They put on him a scarlet robe (περιέθηκαν αὐτῷ χλαμύδα).\" Purple and scarlet are not such very dissimilar colors. Purple is a royal color; and the chlamys of St. Matthew was a short military cloak of scarlet, intended to be a kind of royal livery. St. Cyril says that the purple cloak symbolized the kingdom of the whole world, which Christ was about to receive, and which he was to obtain by the shedding of his most precious blood. It was designed in mockery of his claim to be a King, and it probably bad a reference to his supposed insurrection against Caesar. All this was permitted by Pilate, in order that he might the more easily, after this ignominious treatment, deliver Christ from the extreme sentence. And plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him. The crown of thorns was in all probability woven from the Zizyphus spina Christi (the nabk of the Arabs), which grows abundantly in Palestine, fringing the banks of the Jordan. This plant would be very suitable for the purpose, having flexible branches, with leaves very much resembling the ivy leaf in their color, and with many sharp thorns. The pain arising from the pressure of these sharp thorns upon the head must have been excruciating. And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! (Ξαῖρε βασιλεῦ τῶν Ἰουδαίων). This word, χαῖρε, was an ancient form of salutation; here used by the soldiers in bitter mockery of his claim to be a king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And they smote his head with a reed - the same reed, according to St. Matthew (Matthew 27:29, 30), which they bad first put into his right hand as a scepter, to complete the mocking symbolism - and did spit upon him (ἐνέπτυον αὐτῷ). The verb is in the imperfect; they did it again and again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. The silence of our blessed Lord during these wanton and aggravated insults is very remarkable, and also the total absence of any legal grounds for his condemnation. And they lead him out to crucify him. Assuming the palace of Pilate to have been near the gate of Jaffa, north-west of Mount Zion, and the place of crucifixion that now assigned to it, within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, - the distance would be about one-third of a mile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And they compel one passing by Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross. It seems from St. Matthew (Matthew 27:32) that our Savior bore his own cross from the palace to the gate of the city. The tablet, with the inscription afterwards attached to the cross, would be carried before him; and a certain number of soldiers would be appointed to go with him to the place of execution, and to see the sentence carried out. Having passed out through the gate of the city, they met one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and they compel him (ἀγγαρεύουσι); literally, they impress him. The Cyrenians had a synagogue in Jerusalem (Acts 6:9), and this Simon may probably have been one of those who had come up to keep the Passover. He must have been a Hellenistic Jew, a native of Cyrene, on the north coast of Africa. Alexander and Rufus, his sons, were no doubt, at the time when St. Mark wrote his Gospel, well-known disciples of our Lord. St. Paul, writing to the Romans (Romans 16:13), sends a special salutation to Rufus, \"chosen in the Lord, and his mother, and mine;\" a delicate recognition by St. Paul of something like maternal care bestowed upon him by the mother of Rufus. It is probable that his father Simon, and perhaps his brother Alexander, may have been dead by this time. Rufus is also honorably mentioned by Polycarp in his Epistle to the Philippians. There is a tradition, mentioned by Cornelius a Lapide, that Rufus became a bishop in Spain, and that Alexander suffered martyrdom. To go with them, that he might bear his cross. St. Luke (Luke 23:26) adds the touching words, \"to bear it after Jesus (φέρειν ὔπισθεν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And they bring him (φέρουσιν); literally, they bear him. At ver. 20 another word has been used ἐξάγουσιν \"they lead him out.\" It seems as though, when they had reached the gate of the city, they saw symptoms that our Lord was fainting under his burden; and so they pressed Simon into the service, that he might be ready to assist. At first our Lord carried his own cross. Tradition says (Cornelius a Lapide) that the cross was fifteen feet long, the transverse limb being eight feet; and that he so carried it that the upper portion rested on his shoulder, while the foot of the cross trailed on the ground. When they saw that he was breaking down under the weight of the cross, they laid it on Simon, that they might the more quickly reach the place of crucifixion. The place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. \"Golgotha\" is a Hebrew, or rather Chaldaic, word, applied to the skull on account of its roundness, that being the idea which lies in the root of the word. The Greek equivalent to the word is Κρανίον; and this is rendered in the Vulgate, Calvaria, a skull, from calva, bald. St. Luke is the only evangelist in whose Gospel (Luke 23:33) this word is rendered \"Calvary.\" In the Revised Version it is rendered \"the skull\" The place was so called, either from its having been the spot where executions ordinarily took place (though in this case we might have expected to find it called τόπος κρανίων rather than κρανίον); or, more probably, it was derived from the configuration of the place itself, perhaps a round-like mound, or knoll, sufficiently elevated to be seen at a little distance and by a large number. As to the actual site of Golgotha, recent researches seem to have done much to confirm the ancient tradition. The Bordeaux pilgrim, A.D. 333, says, \"On the left side of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the hillock (monticulus) Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. Hence, about a stone's throw distant, is the crypt where his body was deposited.\" St. Cyril of Jerusalem alludes to the spot frequently, and there was no doubt about it in the time of Eusebius, A.D. 315. Professor Willis says that the rock of Calvary still stands up, some fifteen feet above the pavement. \"It appears likely,\" he says, \"that in its original state this rock was part of a little swell of the ground that jutted out from the slope of Sepulchre Street, and probably always formed a somewhat abrupt view on the west and south sides\" (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on St. Matthew). Captain Conder (Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statement July, 1882) thinks that he shall be able to show that the traditional Golgotha is the site of the original temple of Ashtoreth, and that this temple was the Jebusite sanctuary before David took Jerusalem, and round which the sepulchres of the kings were hewn after the worship of Jehovah had consecrated the temple hill.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. There were two occasions on which drink was offered to our Lord during the agonies of his crucifixion. The first occasion is that mentioned by St. Matthew (Matthew 27:34), when they offered him wine mingled with gall. This was a kind of stupefying liquor, a strong narcotic, made of the sour wine of the country, mingled with bitter herbs, and mercifully administered to dull the sense of pain. This was offered before the actual crucifixion took place. It is to this first occasion that St. Mark here refers. The words in the original are (καὶ ἐδίδουν αὐτῷ ἐσμυρνισμένον οϊνον), \"they were giving, they offered him.\" But he received it not. He would not seek alleviation of the agonies of the crucifixion by any drugged potion which might render him insensible. He would bear the full burden consciously. The second occasion on which drink was offered to him was after he had been some hours on his cross, and when the end was drawing near; and it was then given in answer to his exclamation, \"I thirst.\" This drink does not appear to have been mingled with any stupefying drug; and we do not read that he refused it. St. Mark does not record this second occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And they crucify him (καὶ σταυροῦσιν αὐτὸν,). Such is the most approved reading. The evangelist states the fact without staying to dwell on the painful circumstances connected with the act of nailing him to the cross; and passes on to the mention of other things. They part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take. The outer robe and the tunic would have been removed previously to the crucifixion. St. John (John 21:23) here goes into details. \"They took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top through.. out.\" His garments (τὰ ἱμάτια). This would be the loose, flowing outer dress with girdle. The tunic (χιτών) was a closefitting dress, worn underneath the ἱμάτιον. There were four soldiers employed for each crucifixion. St. Cyril refers to the clothes of criminals as the perquisite of the executioners. Here was another ingredient of bitterness in our Lord's cup, that he saw before his eyes his garments torn by the soldiery, and his tunic divided to them by lot. But he divested himself of these garments of mortality, that he might clothe us with life and immortality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was the third hour, and they crucified him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. The third hour would literally be nine o'clock. But we gather from ver. 33 that our Lord was on his cross, and still alive, at the sixth hour, that is, at twelve o'clock. The simplest mode of solving the chronological difficulty seems to be this: The Jews divided their day into four parts, which they called hours, namely, the first, from six to nine; the third, from nine to twelve; the sixth, from twelve to three; and the ninth, from three to six. It was, then, within the third hour, that is, between nine and twelve, that they crucified him; and it was from the sixth to the ninth hour that he was actually upon his cross. St. John employs the Asiatic mode of computing time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. This would probably be the shortest form of inscription, and in Latin, \"Rex Judaeorum.\" All the evangelists mention the inscription; but no two of them in precisely the same words. It appears by comparison of them that the whole title was, \"This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\" In the case of remarkable prisoners the accusation was written on a white tablet, and carried before them as they went to the place of execution. It was then placed over their heads when the cross was erected. St. John tells us that our Lord's title was written in three languages - Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. Such appears to be the proper order of the words, namely, the national, the official, and the common dialect. St. Mark, writing at Rome, would naturally mention the Latin title. It is quite possible that the superscription may have varied in the different renderings in which it was given. It is evident from St. John (John 21:19-22) that the title was much canvassed by the Jews and the chief priests. Bode says that this title was fitly placed over his head, because, although he was crucified in weakness for us, yet he shone with the majesty of a King above his cross. The title proclaimed that he was after all a King; and that from henceforth he began to reign from his cross over the Jews. And therefore Pilate was divinely restrained from making any alteration in the title, so that it should mean anything less than this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And with him they crucify two robbers (λησταί) - not \"thieves\" (κλέπται); St. Luke (Luke 23:32) shows that these two robbers formed a part of the procession to Calvary; but they were crucified after our Lord - one on his right hand, and one on his left. We know from St. Luke (Luke 23:40) that one of these malefactors was saved; while it would appear that the other died in his sins. And thus Christ upon his cross, between these two men, and with the title of King over his head, presented a striking and awful picture of the final judgment. Such is the view of St. Ambrose on St. Luke 22, and of St. Augustine, who says,\" This cross, if you mark it well, was a judgment-seat. For the Judge being placed in the midst, the one who believed was set free; the other who reviled him was condemned; and thus he signified what he will do with the quick and the dead. Some he will place on his right hand, and some on his left\" (Augustine, Tract. 31 in S. Johan.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - This verse is omitted in the oldest manuscripts. It is supposed to have been taken from St. Luke (Luke 22:37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads. Here was another fulfillment of prophecy, and other aggravation of the misery of Christ. \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him; let him deliver him, seeing he delighteth in him\" (Psalm 22:7, 8). The torment of crucifixion itself was terrible; but it was a still greater torment to the Crucified to be insulted in his agony. Our Lord may well have had these words in his mind, '\"They persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded\" (Psalm 69:26). They that passed by. Calvary was probably near to one of the thoroughfares leading to the city; so that there would be a continual stream of persons passing to and fro; more especially at this time, when Jerusalem was thronged with visitors. And no doubt the words of the accusation against him in its incorrect form would pass freely from mouth to mouth, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If you could make such a boast as this, show your power by coming down from the cross.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave thyself, and come down from the cross.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The chief priests and the scribes are more bitter than the people. In fact they had all along endeavored to rouse the bad passions of the people against our Lord. And now they take advantage of this his present degraded condition to renew the old charge that his miracles of healing had been wrought by Beelzebub, because, if they had been wrought by God, God would have interposed in this his sore extremity and have set him free. He saved others. They cannot deny this fact. But they now try to turn this fact against him, by alleging that he who pretended to work miracles upon others, wrought them, not by the finger of God, but by Beelzebub, seeing that, if they had been wrought by a Divine power, the same power would now be exercised for his deliverance. They desired to take advantage of this public opportunity of exposing him as an impostor, and so they hoped to get rid of him, and at the same time to blot the very name of Christianity from out of the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Christ might have come down from the cross; but he would not, because it was his Father's will that he should die upon the cross to redeem us from death. So he despised the taunts of the wicked, that he might teach us by his example to do the same. If he had chosen to descend from the cross, he would not have ascended. He knew that the death upon the cross was necessary for the salvation of men; and therefore he would go through the whole. He withheld the exercise of his power. His omnipotence restrained the natural longings of his suffering humanity to escape from these unutterable torments. So he would not come down from the cross, although within three days he would rise from the grave. And yet there was no word of indignation against his tormentors. On the contrary, he proclaimed mercy; for as he hung on his cross he said, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - And when the sixth hour was come. This would be midday, twelve o'clock; and the darkness continued until the ninth hour, that is, three o'clock. This supernatural darkness came when the day is wont to be at its brightest. The moon was now at the full, so that it could not have been caused by what we call an eclipse, for when it is full moon the moon cannot intervene between the earth and the sun. This darkness was doubtless produced by the immediate interference of God. An account of it is given by Phlegon of Tralles, a freedman of the Emperor Adrian. Euse-bius, in his records of the year A.D. , quotes at length from Phlegon, who says that, in the fourth year of the 202nd Olympiad, there was a great and remarkable eclipse of the sun, above any that had happened before. At the sixth hour the day was turned into the darkness of night, so that stars were seen in the heaven; and there was a great earthquake in Bithynia, which overthrew many houses in the city of Nicaea. Phlegon attributes the darkness which he describes to an eclipse, which was natural enough for him to do. The knowledge of astronomy was then very imperfect. Phlegon also mentions an earthquake. This brings his account into very close correspondence with the sacred narrative. There was darkness ever the whole land (ἐφ ὅλην τὴν γῆν). \"Land\" is a better rendering than \"earth.\" We are not informed precisely how far the darkness extended. Dionysius says that he saw this phenomenon at Heliopolis, in Egypt, and he is reported to have exclaimed, \"Either the God of nature, the Creator, is suffering, or the universe dissolving.\" St. Cyprian says, \"The sun was constrained to withdraw his rays, and close his eyes, that he might not be compelled to look upon this crime of the Jews. To the same purpose St. Chrysostom, \"The creature could net bear the wrong done to its Creator. Therefore the sun withdrew his rays, that he might not behold the deeds of the wicked.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani? St. Mark here uses the Aramaic form St. Matthew refers to the original Hebrew. St. Mark in all probability took his form from St. Peter. It seems from hence that our Lord was in the habit of using the vernacular speech. Why hast thou forsaken me? (εἰς τί με ἐγκατέλιπες;). This might be rendered, Why didst thou forsake me? It is generally supposed that our blessed Lord, continually praying upon his cross, and offering himself a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, recited the whole of the psalm (22.) of which these are the first words, that he might show himself to be the very Being to whom the words refer; so that the Jewish scribes and people might examine and see the cause why he would not descend from the cross; namely, because this very psalm showed that it was appointed that he should suffer these things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Notwithstanding the supernatural darkness, there were those who lingered about the cross. Indeed, the darkness would add greatly to the awfulness of the place. It was out of that darkness that the voice of Jesus was heard; and inasmuch as Elias, or Elijah, was believed to hold some relation to the Messiah, it was natural for some of those who stood by to understand the words to mean that our Lord was actually calling for Elias.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - There is a slight difference here in the narratives. St. Matthew (Matthew 27:49) says, \"And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him.\" Here in St. Mark the words are recorded as having been spoken by him alone who offered our Lord the vinegar. According to St. John (John 21:28), the offering of the vinegar followed immediately upon the words of our Lord, \"I thirst.\" This drink was not the stupefying potion given to criminals before their crucifixion, to lull the sense of pain, but the sour wine, the ordinary drink of the soldiers, called posen. The reed was most probably the long stalk of the hyssop plant. Dr. J. Forbes Royle, in an elaborate article on the subject, quoted in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible' (vol. 1 p. 846), arrives at the conclusion that the hyssop is none other than the caper plant, the Arabic name of which, asuf, bears a strong resemblance to the Hebrew. The plant is the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus. The apparent difference between the narratives of St. Matthew and St. Mark may be reconciled by weaving in the narrative of St. John with those of the synoptists - the \"Let be\" of the soldiers in the one case being intended to restrain the individual from offering the wine; and the \"Let be\" of the individual, corresponding to our \"Wait a moment,\" while he answered our Savior's cry, \"I thirst.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. The three synoptists all mention this cry, which appears to have been something different from the words which he uttered at or about the time of his death. It was evidently something supernatural, and was so regarded by the centurion who stood by; and who had no doubt been accustomed to scenes like these. Usually the voice fails the dying, more especially when the natural forces have been weakened by long agony, as in the case of our Lord. It seems, therefore, the right conclusion that he cried out, just before he expired, by that supernatural power which his Godhead supplied to him; and thus he showed that, although he had gone through all the pains which were sufficient in ordinary cases to produce death, yet that at length he did not die of necessity, but voluntarily, in accordance with what he had himself said, \"No one taketh my life from me... I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again\" (John 10:18). Victor Antiochanus, in commenting upon this chapter, says, \"By this action the Lord Jesus proved that he had his whole life, and his death, in his own free power.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. There were two veils - one before the holy place, and the other before the holy of holies. The holy place would correspond to what we call the nave of the church, in which the priests were continually present; the holy of holies would correspond to our chancel choir - the holiest part of the building. This was always kept closed; nor might any one enter it but the high priest, and that only once in the year, on the day of expiation. The veil which was rent at our Lord's death was that which was placed before the holy of holies; it was called the καταπέτασμα. The outer veil was called κάλυμμα. It was the duty of the officiating priest, on the evening of the day of preparation, at the hour of evening prayer, which would correspond to the time of our Lord's death, to enter into the holy place, where he would of course be between the two curtains, or veils, the outer veil, or κάλυμμα, and the inner veil, or καταπέτασμα It would then be his business to roll back the κάλυμμα, or outer veil, thus exposing the holy place to the people, who would be in the. outer court. And then and there they would see, to their amazement, the καραπέτασμα, the inner veil, rent asunder from the top to the bottom. These veils or curtains, according to Josephus, were each forty cubits in height and ten in breadth, of great substance, very massive, and richly embroidered with gold and purple. Now, this rending of the veil signifiedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the whole of the Jewish dispensation, with its rites and ceremonies, was now unfolded by Christ; and that thenceforth the middle wall of partition was broken down, so that now, not the Jews only, but the Gentiles also might draw nigh by the blood of Christ. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it further signified that the way to heaven was laid open by our Lord's death. \"When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.\" The veil signified that heaven was closed to all, until Christ by his death rent this veil in twain, and laid open the way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - And when the centurion, which stood by over against him (ὁ παρετηκὼς ἐξ ἐναντίας αὐτοῦ) saw that he so gave up the ghost. The words, \"so cried out,\" are not in the most important authorities. It was the business of the centurion to watch all that took place, and to see that the sentence was executed. He must have been standing close under the cress; and there was that in the whole demeanour of the dying Sufferer, so different from anything that he had ever witnessed before, that it drew from him the involuntary exclamation, Truly this man was the Son of God. He had observed him through those weary hours; he had noticed the meekness and the dignity of the Sufferer; he had heard those words, so deeply impressed upon the faith and reverence of Christians, which fell from him from time to time as he hung there; and then at last he heard the piercing cry, so startling, so unexpected, which escaped him just before he yielded up his spirit; and he could come to no other conclusion than this, that he was in very deed God's Son. It has been supposed by some that this centurion was Longiuus, who was led by the miracles which accompanied the death of Christ, to acknowledge him to be the Son of God, and to be a herald of his resurrection, and was ultimately himself put to death for the sake of Christ in Cappadocia. St. Chrysostom repeats the common report, that on account of his faith he was at last crowned with martyrdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And there were also women holding from afar (ἀπὸ μακρόθεν θεωροῦσαι). St. Matthew (Matthew 27:55) says that there were many. Amongst them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the wife of Clopas, or Alphaeus, and mother of James the less and of Joses, called brethren of our Lord, and the mother of Zebedee's children, that is, Salerno. The mother of our Lord had been there until the time when, having with St. John crept as near the cross of Jesus as she might venture, she was consigned by our Lord to St. John's care, and taken away by him. St. Mark mentions this to show the faith and love of these holy women, because in the very presence of the enemies of Christ they dared to stand by his cross, and shrank not from testifying their piety and devotion. St. John says that they stood near. He must have known; for at one time at least he was standing near. St. Matthew and St. Mark speak of them as at a distance. They were at a distance, no doubt, for the most part, as compared with the soldiers, whose duty it was to be in close attendance and to keep the people off. But these devoted women came as near as they could, so as to see and hear their Lord. Perhaps they were sometimes further off and sometimes nearer, as they saw opportunity, or as the humor of the officials suffered them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - From this verse we learn that these women followed him, and ministered unto him when he was in Galilee; and that many other women came up with him unto Jerusalem. The sublime beauty of his character, and the spiritual, influence which he wielded, attracted them; and they were able to minister to the various needs of his humanity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - And when even was now come. The sabbath commenced on the Friday evening at six o'clock. The evening commenced at three o'clock. Our Lord must be buried before six o'clock.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJoseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Joseph of Arimathaea. St. Jerome says that this city was called Ramathaim-Zophim (the lofty place), where dwelt Elkanah and Hannah of old, and where Samuel was born. Joseph was most probably a native of Arimathaea; but he was now a citizen and counsellor of Jerusalem. He was an honorable counsellor (εὐσχήμων βουλευτής), a councillor of honorable estate (Revised Version). St. Matthew says he was a rich man. It is evident that he regarded himself as a settled inhabitant of Jerusalem, since he had thus provided himself with a place of sepulture. He was waiting for (προσδεχόμενος) - literally, looking for - the kingdom of God. St. Matthew (Matthew 27:57) says that he was a disciple of Jesus. These circumstances explain his desire to bury our Lord. He boldly went in (τολμήσας εἰσῆλθε) - literally, he took courage and went in - unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. A poor man would not have dared to approach Pilate for such a purpose as this. St. Chrysostom says, \"The courage of Joseph is greatly to be admired, in that, for the love of Christ, he exposed himself to the danger of death.\" The fact that he was \"looking for the kingdom of God\" explains his conduct. It shows that he believed in Christ, and through his grace hoped for everlasting salvation; and in this hope he thought little of shelving his reverence for Christ, and so\" boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. It must have Been somewhat early in the afternoon, probably not long after three o'clock, when Joseph went. The day being the Preparation, the Jews were anxious to satisfy the letter of the Law (Deuteronomy 21:13), and that, more especially, because the coming sabbath was a \"high day.\" So they had gone early to Pilate to obtain permission to accelerate the deaths of the sufferers by the terrible additional punishment called σκελοκοπία. This violence was not inflicted upon our Lord, because he was already dead; and so another Scripture was fulfilled, \"A bone of him shall not be broken.\" But it was necessary that Pilate should be assured of the fact that death had taken place before he gave up the body; and thus, in the providence of God, another evidence was given of the reality of Christ's death. Joseph asked for the body (σῶμα). Then Pilate asked the centurion \"whether he had been any while dead.\" The verb here is in the aorist, and the adverb means \"formerly\" (εἰ πάλαι ἀπέθανε); literally, if he died some time ago.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted (ἐδωρήσατο) the corpse (τὸ πτῶμα) to Joseph.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - And he bought a linen cloth (σινδόνα). This was a fine linen garment, or shroud, something like that in which the young man fled the night before (Mark 14:51, 52). And taking him down (καθελὼν αὐτὸν). It appears from these words that Joseph himself, assisted probably by Nicodemus and others, actually took the body of our Lord down from the cross. wrapped the sindon round him, and laid him in his own new tomb, which had been hewn out of the rock. The word rendered \"tomb\" is μνημεῖον, as being intended to be a memorial of the departed. And he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. The door here means \"the opening,\" or \"entrance.\" Thus, while our Lord died with the wicked, he was with the rich in his death (Isaiah 53:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark15:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid (ἐθεώρουν ποῦ τίθεται); literally, were beholding where he was laid. These women were two of the group mentioned at ver. 40. They remained, after the body of our Lord had been deposited, in sad and silent contemplation. The women appear to have broken up into two groups. One group went alone to purchase spices and ointments, which it was necessary for them to do before six o'clock, when the sabbath commenced; in readiness for the embalming. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses and Salome appear to have bought them after six o'clock on the Saturday night.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices ἠγόρασαν ἀρώματα) that they might come and anoint him. A hasty but lavish embalming of our Lord's sacred body had been begun on Friday evening by Joseph and Nicodemus. They had \"brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight\" (John 19:39). This would be a compound - the gum of the myrrh tree, and a powder of the fragrant aloe wood mixed together, with which they would completely cover the body, which was then swathed with linen cloths (ὀθόνια), also steeped in the aromatic preparation. Then the sindon would he placed over all. Compare the ἐνετύλιξεν, of St. Luke (Luke 23:53), as applying to the sindon, with the ἔδησαν of St. John (John 21:40) as applying to the ὀθόνια. This verse records a further stage in the embalming. What had been done on the Friday evening had been done in haste, and yet sufficiently for the preservation of the sacred body, if that had been needful, from decay. The remaining work could be done more carefully and tenderly at the tomb. Observe the aorist in this verse (hJgo>rasan) \"they bought;\" not \"they had bought.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And very early on the first day of the week (λιάν πρωί' τῇ μιᾶ τῶν σαββάτων), they come (ἔρχονται - not \"they came,\" St. Mark is fond of the graphic present - to the tomb when the sun was risen. They bought the spices that they needed on the Saturday evening, after the sabbath was past; and then set out early the next morning, reaching the tomb when the sun was risen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And they were saying (ἔλεγον) among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb? The usual form of tombs in Palestine was the following: - There was generally an approach to the tomb open to the sky; then a low entrance on the side of the rock, leading into a square chamber, on one side of which was a recess for the body, about three feet deep, with a low arch over it. The stone here referred to by the women would be the stone which covered the actual entrance into the vault. It would probably be not less than six feet in breadth and three in height. This great stone had been rolled By Joseph to the mouth of the tomb; and then he had departed. Now, as the women approached, \"they were saying (ἔλεγον,) among themselves, Who shall roll us away (ἀποκυλίσει) the stone?\" They had seen the arrangements, and had observed the size of the atone on the Friday evening. (Mark 15:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And looking up (ἀναβλέψασαι) they see (θεωροῦσιν) that the stone is rolled back (ἀποκεκύλισται): for it was exceeding great (μέγας σφόδρα). At this point we learn from St. John that Mary Magdalene ran away to tell Peter and John (John 20:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed. They enter the tomb, the expression \"tomb\" including the ante-chamber They see that the stone has been rolled back, so as to expose the entrance into the place where Jesus had lain. On that stone a young man was sitting. The angel peared in the form of a young man, because youth indicates the vigor, the beauty, and the strength of angels. The good angels always appear in beauty and comeliness of form. There will be no deformity in heaven. The angel appeared as arrayed in a white robe. This white robe, or talar indicated a heavenly spiritual being. St. Matthew (Matthew 28:3) says that \"his countenance was like lightning,\" flashing with splendor, and his raiment was as white as snow. It may be that he appeared more terrible to the keepers (Matthew 28:4), and that he abated something of his dazzling brightness when he appeared to the women; but \"they were affrighted\" (ἐξεθαμβήθησαν); literally, they were amazed. Amazement was the dominant feeling, though probably not unmingled with fear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And he saith unto them, Be not amazed - μὴ ἐκθαμβεῖσθε, the same word - ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, which hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him; that is, here is the place where they laid him (ἴδε ὁ τόπος). St. Matthew (Matthew 28:6) says, \"Come, see the place where the Lord lay\" (Δεῦτε ἴδετε τὸν τόπον). This seems to imply that the women actually entered the inner chamber, and saw the very place where the Lord lay. Who does not see here how irrefragable is the evidence of his resurrection?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. St. Gregory ('Hom. in Evan.') says, \"If the angel had not named Peter, he would not have dared to come amongst the disciples. Therefore he is specially named, lest he should despair on account of his denial.\" It was evidently intended as a special message of comfort to Peter. St. Luke (Luke 24:34) records the personal appearance of our Lord first to Peter. Here St. Mark, with characteristic modesty, keeps Peter in the background. In Mark 14:28 our Lord is recorded to have said, \"After I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.\" He would go before them as their Shepherd, and lead them to that part of the Holy Land which, as he had honored it before his resurrection, so he would honor it again now.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And they went out - the word (ταχὺ) \"quickly\" is omitted - and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them (τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις) - agitation and ecstasy; they were in a state of the utmost excitement. And they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid. The vision of angels had terrified them. They were probably afraid to say anything to any one, on account of the Jews, lest it should be said that they had stolen the body of Jesus. It has been well remarked that independent accounts of events occurring a time of supreme excitement, and related by trustworthy witnesses, but from different points of view, naturally present difficulties which cannot be cleared up without a full knowledge of all the particulars. (See 'Speaker's Commentary' in Matthew 28:9)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils. St. Luke (Luke 8:2) mentions that \"seven devils had gone out of her;\" and St. Mark repeats it here, to show the power of love and penitence, that she was the first to be permitted to see the risen Savior. The vision of the angel had scared her, and she said nothing; but the actual sight of her risen Lord gave her confidence, and she went immediately, in obedience to his command, and told the disciples (see John 20:11-18). She had lingered about his tomb; her strong affection riveted her to the spot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - She went and told (ἐκείνη πορευθεῖσα ἀπήγγειλε) them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. The aorist here indicates immediate action. This word πορεύεσθαι occurs again in vers. 12 and 15, but nowhere else in St. Mark's Gospel It is to be noticed, however, that it occurs twice in the First Epistle of St. Peter, and once in his Second Epistle. This seems to connect St. Peter with the writer of these verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved (ἠπίστησαν). They refused to believe on the bare statement of Mary Magdalene, although M. Renan says, \"Sa grande affirmation de femme, 'Il est res-suscitei' a ete la base de la foi de l'humanite.\" They did not believe her until the risen Lord stood before them.

This want of faith happened by the permission and providence of God. \"This their unbelief,\" says St. Gregory, \"was not so much their infirmity as our future constancy on the faith.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And afterward (ὕστερον δὲ) he was manifested (ἐφανερώθη) unto the eleven themselves (αὐτοῖς τοῖς ἔνδεκα) as they sat at meat. There is an emphasis here on the word \"themselves.\" The former appearances had been to persons not having any official character. But now he appears to the eleven apostles, when they were all gathered together at the close of that memorable day. \"Unto the eleven.\" If, as seems evident, this appearance refers to the day of our Lord's resurrection, there would be only ten present; for Thomas was not then with them. Still, they might be called the eleven, because the apostolic college was reduced to eleven after the betrayal by Judas; so that they might still be called the eleven, although Thomas was absent. St. Bernard says on this, \"If Christ comes and is present when we sit at meat, how much more when we kneel in prayer!\" He upbraided them (ὠνείδισε). This is a strong word of rebuke. They ought to have received the testimony of competent witnesses. But their doubts were only removed by the evidence of their senses; just as afterwards in the case of Thomas. St. Mark is always careful to record the rebukes administered by our Lord to his apostles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation (πάσῃ τῇ κτίσει). He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. Here is a considerable interval of time, not noticed in any way by the evangelist. And he saith unto them; not on the day of his resurrection. It would seem that this charge was delivered to them in Galilee, and that it is the same as that recorded in St. Matthew (Matthew 28:19), which was again repeated immediately before his ascension from Bethany. Go ye into all the world; not into Judaea only, but everywhere. This command has expanded with the discovery in later times of new portions of the inhabited earth; and must ever be coextensive with geographic discovery. Preach the gospel to the whole creation; that is, \"among all nations.\" Man is the noblest work of God. All the creation is gathered up in him, created after the image of the Creator. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned. These words are very important. The first clause opposes the notion that faith alone is sufficient for salvation, without those works which are the fruit of faith. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; that is, he that believeth, and as an evidence of his faith accepts Christ's baptism, and fulfils the promises and vows which he then took upon himself, working out his own salvation with fear and trembling, shall be saved. But he that disbelieveth shall be condemned (ὁ δὲ ἀπιστήσας κατακριθήσεται,). The condemnation anticipates the doom which will be incurred by continual unbelief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - And these signs shall follow them that believe. Such evidences were necessary in the first dawn of Christianity, to attract attention to the doctrine; but our Lord's words do not mean that they were to be in perpetuity, as a continually recurring evidence of the truth of Christianity. St. Gregory (on 1 Corinthians 14:22) says, \"These signs were necessary in the beginning of Christianity. In order that faith might take root and increase, it must be nourished by miracle; for so even we, when we plant shrubs, only water them until we see that they are taking root, and when we see that they have rooted themselves, we cease to water them. And this is what St. Paul means where he says 'Tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving' (1 Corinthians 14:22).\" In my name shall they cast out devils. St. Mark, of all the evangelists, dwells most perhaps on this, as characteristic of our Lord's work, and as the evidence of his supreme dominion over the spiritual world. They shall speak with new tongues. This was the first intimation of the great miracle to be inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The gift was continued but for a very limited time. They shall take up serpents. The instance of St. Paul at Melita (Acts 28:3-5) would be familiar to St. Mark's readers. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them. There are some few traditionary notices of the fulfillment of this promise; as in the case of \"Justus Barsabas,\" mentioned by Eusebius ('H.E.,' 3, 19), and of St. John, mentioned by St. Augustine. It may be observed of this passage, that no one could have interpolated it after the cessation of the signs to which it refers, which took place very early.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven. Here is another interval. The evangelist has gathered up some few of the most important words and sayings of Christ; and now he takes his reader to Bethany, the scene of our Lord's ascension. It has been well observed (see Bishop Wordsworth, in loc.) that the fact of the Ascension is gradually revealed in the Gospels. St. Matthew does not mention it at all. St. Mark refers to it in this brief and very simple manner. But St. Luke describes it with great fullness, both in his Gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles, throughout which book he leads his readers to contemplate Christ as ascended into heaven, and as sitting at God's right hand, and as ruling the Church and the world from the throne of his glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen. These words are alluded to in several passages by Justin Martyr (about A.D. ), and, for the reasons given above, could not have been written later than the time of miracles being wrought. They form a fitting introduction to the Acts of the Apostles. Cornelius a Lapide concludes his Commentary upon St. Mark with the following beautiful apostrophe of St. Augustine: - \"O kingdom of everlasting blessedness, where youth never grows old, where beauty never fades, where love never waxes cold, where health never fails, where joy never decreases, where life never ends!\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. These words mean, not the title of the book, but the commencement of the narrative; and so they depend upon what follows, namely, \"as it is written\" (καθῶς for ὠς), \"even as it is written.\" The words \"the gospel of Jesus Christ\" do not signify the book which St. Mark wrote, but the evangelical teaching of Jesus Christ. St. Mark means that the gospel announcement by Jesus Christ had such a beginning as had been predicted by Isaiah and Malachi, namely, the preaching of John the Baptist, and his testimony concerning Christ, to be fully laid open by the preaching and the death of Christ. The preaching of repentance by the Baptist was the preparation and the beginning of the evangelical preaching by Christ, of whom John was the forerunner. It has been well observed that St. Matthew and St. John begin their Gospels from Christ himself; but St. Matthew from the human, and St. John from the Divine, generation of Christ. St. Mark and St. Luke commence from John the Baptist; but St. Luke from his nativity, and St, John from his preaching. The words, the Son of God, are rightly retained in the Revised Version, although they are omitted by some ancient authorities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Even as it is written in the prophets. The weight of evidence is here in favor of the reading \"in Isaiah the prophet.\" Three of the most important uncials (א, B, and L), and twenty-six of the cursives, have the reading \"Isaiah.\" With these agree the Italic, Coptic, and Vulgate versions. Of the Fathers, Irenaeus quotes the passage three times, twice using the words \"in the prophets,\" and once \"in Isaiah the prophet.\" Generally the Fathers agree that \"Isaiah\" is the received reading. The more natural reading would of course be \"in the prophets,\" inasmuch as two prophets are quoted; but in deciding upon readings, it constantly happens that the less likely reading is the more probable. In the case before us we can hardly account for \"Isaiah\" being exchanged for \"the prophets,\" although we can quite understand \"the prophets\" being interpolated for \"Isaiah.\" Assuming, then, that St. Mark wrote \"in Isaiah the prophet,\" we may ask why he mentions Isaiah only and not Malachi? The answer would seem to be this, that here the voice of Isaiah is the more powerful of the two. But in real truth, Malachi says the same thing that Isaiah says; for the messenger sent from God to prepare the way of Christ was none other than John, crying aloud and preaching repentance as a preparation for the receiving of the grace of Christ. The oracle of Malachi is, in fact, contained in the oracle of Isaiah; for what Malachi predicted, the same had Isaiah more clearly and concisely predicted in other words. And this is the reason why St. Mark here, and other evangelists elsewhere, when they cite two prophets, and two or more sentences from different places in the same connection, cite them as one and the same testimony, each sentence appearing to be not so much two, as one and the same declaration differently worded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJohn did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - John came, and preached the baptism of repentance. John came, that is, that he might rouse the people to repentance, and prepare them, by the outward cleansing of their bodies, to receive the cleansing of their souls through Christ's baptism, which was to follow his. So that the baptism of John was the profession of their penitence. Hence they who were baptized with his baptism confessed their sins, and thus made the first step towards the forgiving mercy which was to be found in Christ; and the seal of his forgiveness they were to look for in his baptism, which is a baptism for the remission of sins to all true penitents and faithful believers. Christ's baptism was, therefore, the perfection and consummation of the baptism of John.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Clothed with camel's hair. This was a rough, coarse garment, characteristic of the doctrine which John taught, namely, penitence and contempt of the world. Camels abounded in Syria. And a leathern girdle about his loins. Not only the prophets, but the Jews and the inhabitants of Syria generally, used a girdle to keep the long flowing garment more closely about them, so as to leave them more free for journeying or for labour. Thus our Lord says (Luke 12:35), \"Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning.\" And he did eat locusts and wild honey. The insect called the locust (ἀκρὶς) was permitted to be eaten (see Leviticus 11:22). It was used as food by the common people in Judaea. The Arabs eat them to this day; but they are considered as a common and inferior kind of food. They are a sign of temperance, poverty, and penitence. The wild honey (μέλι ἄγριον) was simply honey made by wild bees, either in the trees or in the hollows of the rocks. Isidorus says that it was of an inferior flavour. Both these kinds of food were consistent with the austere life and the solemn preaching of the Baptist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. This was the menial office of the slave, whose business it was to take off? and put on the shoes of his master, stooping down with all humility and respect for this purpose. Thus John confessed that he was the servant of Christ, and that Christ was his Lord. In a mystical sense the shoes denote the humanity of Christ, which by its union with the Word became of the highest dignity and majesty. St. Bernard says, \"The majesty of the Word was shod with the sandal of our humanity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with [or in] the Holy Ghost. It is as though he said, \"Christ will pour his Holy Spirit so abundantly upon you, that he will cleanse you from all your sins, and fill you with holiness and love and all his other excellent graces.\" Christ did this visibly on the day of Pentecost. And this he does invisibly in the. sacrament of Holy Baptism, and in the rite of Confirmation, which is the completion of the sacrament of Baptism. John baptized with water only, but Christ with water and the Holy Spirit. John baptized the body only, Christ baptizes the soul. By how much, therefore, the Holy Spirit transcends the water, and the soul excels the body, by so much is Christ's baptism more excellent than that of John, which was only preparatory and rudimentary. If it be asked why it was needful that our Lord should be baptized with John's baptism, the best answer is that given by Christ himself, \"Suffer it to be so now; for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness;\" it becometh us - me in receiving this baptism, and you in imparting it. Christ was sent to do the whole will of God; and as in his circumcision, so in his baptism, \"he was made to be sin for us, who knew no sin.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Straightway (εὐθέως) coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened (σχιζομένους); literally, rent asunder. The word εὐθέως occurs more than forty times in this Gospel, and is so characteristic of St. Mark that, in the Revised Version, it is uniformly rendered by the same English synonym, \"straightway.\" He saw. Elsewhere we are told (John 1:32) that St. John the Baptist saw this descent. The earliest heretics took advantage of this statement to represent this event as the descent of the eternal Christ upon the man Jesus for personal indwelling. Later critics have adopted this view. But it need hardly be said here that such an opinion is altogether inconsistent with all that we read elsewhere of the circumstances of the Incarnation, and of the intimate and indissoluble union of the Divine and human natures in the person of the one Christ, from the time of the \"overshadowing of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Highest.\" The Spirit descending upon him at his baptism was not the descent of the eternal Christ upon the man Jesus. It was rather the conveyance to one who was already prepared for it as God and man, of office and authority as the great Prophet that should come into the world. St. Luke says particularly (Luke 3:21) that it was when Jesus had been baptized and was praying, that the Holy Spirit descended upon him; plainly showing us that it was not through the baptism of John, but through the meritorious obedience and the prayer of the Son of God, that the heavens were \"rent asunder,\" and the Holy Spirit descended upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Driveth him (ἐκβάλλει); literally, driveth him forth. That Holy Spirit, which not long before he had received at his baptism, impelled him with great energy; so that of his own accord he went forth, armed with Divine power, into the desert, that there, as in a wrestling-place, he might contend alone with Satan. There Christ and antichrist met, and entered upon the conflict upon the issue of which our salvation depended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Forty days tempted of Satan. St. Mark gathers up the whole temptation into this one sentence; and the passage would seem to imply that the three temptations recorded by St. Matthew and St. Luke were not the only trials through which our Lord passed during those forty days, although they were no doubt the prominent and the most powerful assaults upon our Redeemer. And he was with the wild beasts (μετὰ τῶν θηρίων). This shows the extreme solitude of the place. It shows also the innocence of our Lord, that there, in that wild and desolate district, amongst lions, and wolves, and leopards, and serpents, he neither feared them nor was injured by them. He dwelt amongst them as Adam lived with them in his state of innocence in Paradise. These wild beasts recognized and revered their Creater and their Lord. And the angels ministered unto him. This, as we learn from St. Matthew (Matthew 4:11), was after his temptation and victory. Some have thought that Jesus became known to the devil as the Son of God, by the reverence and adoration of the angels. Thus Jesus showed in his own person, when alone he had striven with Satan and, had overcome him, that heavenly comfort and the ministry of angels are provided by God for those who overcome temptation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Now after that John was put in prison (μετὰ τὸ παραδοθῆναι); literally, was delivered up. This was our Lord's second coming into Galilee. Galilee had been specially designated as the scene of the Divine manifestation (see Isaiah 9:1, 2). The land of Galilee, or of Zebulun and Naphtali, had the misfortune to be the first in the sad calamity which fell upon the Jewish nation through the Assyrian invasion; and, in order to console them under this grievious affliction, Isaiah assures them that, by way of recompense, they, above the rest of their brethren, should have the chief share in the presence and ministry of the future promised Messiah. It seems probable that our Lord remained some time in Judaea after his baptism. From thence he went, with Andrew and Peter, two of John's disciples, into Galilee, where he called Philip. And then it was that he turned the water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana. This was his first coming out of Judaea into Galilee, related by St. John (John 1:43, etc.). But the Passover brought him back into Judaea, that he might present himself in the temple; and then occurred his first purging of the temple (John 2:14). Then came the visit of Nicedemus to him by night; and then he began openly to preach and to baptize (John 3:26), and thus incurred the envy of the scribes and Pharisees. Therefore he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee; and this is the departure here recorded by St. Mark and by St. Matthew (Matthew 4:12). Hence it came to pass that it was in Galilee that Christ called to himself four fishermen - Andrew and Peter, James and John.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The time is fulfilled; that is, the time for the coming of Messiah and of his kingdom. The kingdom which had been shut for so many ages was now to be reopened by the preaching and the death of Christ. The time is very accurately indicated. St. Matthew tells us (Matthew 4:12) that \"when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;\" and then presently afterwards he adds, \"From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand.\" The time and place are also accurately specified by St. Peter (Acts 10:36, 37), where he tells Cornelius that \"the word of peace, preached by Jesus Christ, was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached.\" It was necessary that these circumstances should be carefully detailed, because they were among the proofs of the Messiahship of Jesus. Elias must come first; and he had come in the person of the Baptist, although the prophecy probably awaits its full accomplishment in the actual reappearance of the great prophet of Israel before the second coming of our Lord. Repent ye, and believe the gospel. These words may be regarded as a summary of the method of salvation. Repentance and faith are the conditions of admission into the Christian covenant. Repentance has a special reference to God the Father, and faith, to Jesus Christ the eternal Son. It is in the gospel that Christ is revealed to us as a Saviour; and therefore we find Jesus Christ, as the object of our faith, distinguished from the Father as the object of our repentance. Repentance of itself is not sufficient - it makes no satisfaction for the Law which we have broken; and hence, over and above repentance, there is required from us faith in the Gospel, wherein Christ is revealed to us as a propitiation for sin, and as the only way of reconciliation with the Father. Without faith repentance becomes despair, and without repentance faith becomes only presumption. Join the two together, and the faithful soul is borne onwards, like a well-balanced vessel, to the haven where it would be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee; a better reading is (καὶ παράγων), and passing along. Our Lord came up from the south, passing through Samaria, till he reached Cana of Galilee. He then passed along by the seashore towards Capernaum; and on his way found the four disciples whom he had previously nominated, but who were now engaged in their calling of fishermen. St. Mark then relates the circumstances of their call in the exact words of St. Matthew, which were in all probability those of apostolical tradition ('Speaker's Commentary'). It will be seen that St. Mark's account, in this introductory portion of his Gospel, is very concise, and that there are many things to be supplied from the first chapter of St. John; as, for example, that after our Lord's baptism by John, and afar his fasting and temptation in the desert, the Jews sent messengers to the Baptist, to inquire of him whether he were the Christ. John at once confessed that he was not the Christ, but that there was One even then among them, though they knew him not, who was indeed the Christ And then, the very next day after, Jesus came to him, and John then said to those around him, \"Behold the Lamb of God!\" Upon this two of John's disciples at once betook-themselves to Jesus. The first was Andrew, who forthwith brought his own brother Simon, afterwards called \"Peter,\" to our Lord. Again, the day after the, our Lord called Philip, a fellow-citizen with Andrew and Peter, of Bethsaida. Then Philip brought Nathanael. Here, then, we have some more disciples nominated, who were with Jesus at the marriage in Cana of Galilee. Then Jesus retched again into Judaea; and those disciples \"nominate,\" as we might call them, went back for a time to their occupation of fishermen. Meanwhile our Lord, while in Judaea, wrought miracles and preached, until the envy of the scribes and Pharisees constrained him to return again into Galilee. And then it was that he solemnly called Andrew and Peter, and James and John, as recorded by St. Mark here. So that St John alone gives some account of the events of the first year of our Lord's ministry. The three synoptic Gospels give the narrative of his public ministry, commencing from the second year. He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea. (βάλλοντας ἀμφίβληστρον ἐν τῇ θαλάσση). Such was the text underlying the Authorized Version; but a better reading is (ἀμφιβάλλοντας ἐν τῇ θαλάσση). St. Mark thinks it unnecessary to mention the net at all; though doubtless it was the ἀμφίβληστρον, or casting-net. When our Lord likens his gospel to a net, he uses the figure of the drag-not (σαγήνη), a net of a much larger size. But whether it be the casting-net or the drag-net, the comparison is a striking one. It is plain that, in the pursuit of his calling, the fisherman has no power to make any separation between the good fish and the worthless. He has little or no insight into what is going on beneath the surface of the water. So with the \"fisher of men.\" He deals with the world spiritual and invisible; and how, then, can he be fully conscious of the results of his work? His work is pre-eminently a work of faith. It may be observed here that St. Mark, in this earlier part of his narrative, speaks of St. Peter as Simon, though afterwards (Mark 3:16) he calls him Peter. We may also notice here, once for all, St. Mark's constant use of the word \"straightway\" (εὐθέως or εὐθὺς). This word occurs no less than ten times in this chapter. In the Authorized Version the word (εὐθέως)is rendered indifferently by various English synonyms, as \"forthwith,\" \"immediately,\" etc.; whereas in the Revised Version it has been thought fit to note this peculiarity or mannerism in St. Mark's Gospel by the use of the same English synonym, \"straightway,\" throughout this Gospel. The Holy Spirit, while guiding the minds of those whom he moved to write these records, did not use an overpowering influence, so as to interfere with their own natural modes of expression. Each sacred writer, while guarded against error, has reserved to him his own peculiarities of style and expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - The calling of James and John, the sons of Zebedee. St. Mark here mentions that they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants (μετὰ τῶν μισθωτῶν). This mention of the \"hired servants\" is peculiar to St. Mark. He often follows the narrative of St. Matthew; but he adds little details such as this, here and there, which show that he knew St. Matthew's narrative to be true, and also that he was an independent witness. This circumstance here incidentally mentioned shows that there was a difference in position in life between Zebedee's family and that of Simon and Andrew. It appears that all Jews had free right of fishing in the sea of Galilee, which abounded in fish. Zebedee, therefore, whose home seems to have been at Jerusalem, had a fishing establishment in Galilee, probably managed by his partners, Andrew and Simon, during his absence. But he would naturally visit the establishment from time to time With his sons, and especially before the great festivals, when a larger supply of fish than usual would be required for the visitors crowding to Jerusalem at that time. (See 'Speaker's Commentary.')NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And they went into Capernaum; literally, they go into Capernaum (εἰσπορεύονται). St. Mark is fond of the historical \"present \"tense, which often adds life and energy to his narrative. Who go into Capernaum? Our Lord and these four disciples, the elementary Church of God, the nucleus of that spiritual influence which is to spread wider and wider unto the perfect day. It does not follow that this going into Capernaum took place on the same day. They would not have been fishing on the sabbath day. The synagogue here spoken of was the gift of the good centurion of whom we read in St. Matthew (Matthew 8:5) and St. Luke (Luke 7:2). Thus the first synagogue in which our Lord preached was the gift of a generous Gentile officer. It was an emblem of the union of Jews and Gentiles in one fold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They were astonished at his teaching (ἐξεπλήσσοντο ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ). The verb in the Greek is a very strong and expressive one; it is a very suitable word to express the first impressions of utter amaze-sent produced by our Lord's \"teaching.\" There were several things which caused his teaching (δίδαχη) to differ from that of the scribes. There was no lack of self-assertion in their teaching; but their words did not carry weight. Their teaching was based chiefly on tradition; it dwelt much on the \"mint and anise and cummin\" of religion, but neglected \"judgment and mercy and faith.\" Christ's teaching, on the contrary, was eminently spiritual. And then he practiced what he taught. Not so the scribes. Thus far St. Mark's narrative bears the character of brevity and conciseness, suitable to an introduction. From this point his record is rich in detail and in graphic description.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And straightway there was in their synagogne a man with an unclean spirit. According to the best authorities, the sentence in the Greek runs thus, Καὶ εὐθὺς η΅ν ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ αὐτῶν· And straightway there was in their synagogue, etc. This word \"straightway\" adds much force to the sentence. It marks the immediate effect of our Lord's preaching. A man with an unclean spirit. The words are literally, \"a man in an unclean spirit\" (ἐν πνεύματι ἀκάθαρτῳ); in his grasp, so to speak; possessed by him. There can be no reasonable doubt as to the personality of this unclean spirit (see Mark 4:24; Mark 12:41). The man was so absolutely in the power of this evil spirit that he seemed to dwell in him; just as the world is said by St. John (1 John 5:19) to lie \"in the evil one\" (ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ). And he cried out. Who cried out? Surely the unclean spirit, using the possessed man as his instrument. In the case of a true prophet, inspired by the Holy Spirit, he is permitted to use his own gifts, his reason, and even his own particular manner of speech; whereas here a false and lying spirit usurps the organs of speech, and makes them his own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The expression, Ἔα, incorrectly rendered Let us alone, has not sufficient authority to be retained here, though it is rightly retained in the parallel passage in St. Luke (Luke 4:34), where it is rendered in the Revised Version \"Ah!\" or \"Ha!\" If rendered, \"Let us alone,\" or \"Let alone,\" it must be assumed to be the imperative of ἐάω. It will be observed that this cry of the unclean spirit is spontaneous, before our Lord has addressed him. In real truth, the preaching of Jesus has already thrown the whole world of evil spirits into a state of excitement and alarm. The powers of darkness are beginning to tremble. They resent this intrusion into their domain. They feel that One greater than Satan has appeared, and they ask, What have we to do with thee? Wherein have we injured thee, that thou shouldest seek to drive us out of our possession? We have nothing to do with thee, thou Holy One of God; but we have a right to take possession of sinners. Beds says that the evil spirits, perceiving that \"our Lord had come into the world, believed that they were about at once to be judged. They knew that dispossession would be their entrance upon a condition of torment, and therefore it is that they deprecate it.\" I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. St. Mark is very careful to bring out the hidden knowledge possessed by evil spirits, which enabled them at once to recognize the personality of Jesus (see Mark 1:34; Mark 3:11). It was given to them by him who has supreme power over the spiritual as well as the material world, to know as much as he saw fit that they should know; and he was pleased to make known as much as was needful. \"But he made himself known to them, not as he makes himself known to the holy angels, who know him as the Word of God, and rejoice in his eternity, of which they partake. To the evil spirits he made himself known only so far as was requisite to strike with terror the beings from whose tyranny he was about to free those who were predestinated unto his kingdom and the glory of it\" (see St. Augustine, 'City of God,' bk. 9:§ 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Hold thy peace, and come out of him. It was necessary that our Lord should at once assert his absolute power over the evil spirits; and not only this, but also that he should show that he had nothing to do with them. Later on in his ministry it was objected to him that he cast out devils by the prince of the devils. Then, further, the time was not yet arrived when Christ was to be publicly proclaimed as the Son of God. This great truth was to be gradually unfolded, and the people were to be persuaded by many miracles. But at present they were not prepared for this, and therefore our Lord charged his apostles that they should not make him known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And when the unclean spirit had torn him; and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him (καὶ σπαράξαν αὐτὸν). The Greek word σπαράσσω may be rendered in the passive to be convulsed. It is so used by medical writers, as Galen. It could hardly here mean physically \"laceration,\" for St. Luke (Luke 4:35) is careful to say that \"when the devil had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no hurt.\" At all events, the expression indicates the close union of the evil spirit with the possessed man's consciousness and with his physical frame. And the manner in which he departed showed his malignity, as though, being compelled by the supreme authority of Christ to leave the man, he would injure him as far as he was able to do so. But the power of Christ prevented him from doing any real injury. And all this was doneNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that there might be clear evidence that the man was actually possessed by the evil spirit;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the anger and malice of the evil spirit might be shown; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that it might be manifest that the unclean spirit came out, not of his own accord, but constrained and vanquished by Christ. We may observe also that the power of Christ restrained him from the use of any articulate words. While he was in possession he used the possessed man's organs of speech; but when he came out there was no articulate speech - it was nothing but a cry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? The now generally approved text gives a different rendering, namely, What is this? a new teaching! (Τί ἐστὶ τοῦτο δὶδαχη καινή). If this is the true reading - and there is excellent authority for it - it would mean that the bystanders inferred that this new and unexampled power indicated the accompanying gift of a \"new teaching,\" a new revelation. Nay, more, it indicated that he who wrought these miracles must be the promised Messiah, the true God; for he alone by his power could rule the evil spirits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - All the region round about Galilee; more literally, all the region of Galilee, round about; and the best readings add \"everywhere\" (πανταχοῦ εἰς ὅλην τὴν περίχωρον τῆς Γαλιλαίας). This is, of course, said by anticipation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - They came; a better reading is, he came (ἤλθεν). St. Matthew and St. Luke speak of this house as the house of Simon Peter only; but St. Mark, writing probably under St. Peter's direction, includes Andrew as a joint owner with Simon Peter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - Lay sick of a fever (κατέκειτο πυρέσσουσα). St. Luke (Luke 4:38) uses a stronger expression, \"was holden with a great fever\" (συνεχομένη πυρετῷ μεγάλῳ). There were marshes in that district; hence the prevalence of fevers of a malignant character. There is no mention of the wife of Peter by name in the New Testament. We may infer, from the fact that his wish's mother lived with him, that he was the head of the family. St. Paul (1 Corinthians 9:5) intimates that he was a married man, and that his wife accompanied him on his missionary tours. According to the testimony of Clement of Alexandria, and of Eusebius (3:30), she suffered martyrdom, and was led away to death in the sight of her husband, whose last words to her were, \"Remember thou the Lord.\" St. Mark here tells us that Jesus came and took [Simon's wife's mother] by the hand, and raised her up. St. Luke (Luke 4:39) says that \"he stood over her and rebuked the fever.\" Immediately the fever left her. The word \"immediately\" (εὐθέως), familiar as it is to St. Mark, is here omitted by the best authorities. But the omission is of no importance; for the fact that \"the fever left her,\" and that she was at once strong enough to \"minister to them,\" proves that it was not like an ordinary recovery from fever, which is wont to be slow and tedious.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - At even, when the sun did set. It was the sabbath day; and, therefore, the sick were not brought to our Lord until six o'clock, when the sabbath ended. When the sun did set (ὅτε ἔδυ ὁ ἥλίος). St. Luke's phrase is (δύνοντος τοῦ ἡλίου), \"When the sun was, so to speak, submerged in the sea.\" So in Virgil, 'Aeneid,' lib. 7:100 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"...qua sol utrumque recurrensNEWLINEAdspicit Oceanum;\"NEWLINENEWLINEthe popular idea being that, when the sun sets, it sinks into the ocean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the city was gathered together at the door.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33, 34. - The whole city was gathered together at the door. This would probably be the outer door in the wall, opening into the street; so that this need not be regarded as a hyperbolic statement. It is evidently the description of an eye-witness, or of one who had it from an eye-witness. He healed all that had need of healing, and he suffered not the devils to speak, for the reasons. assigned at ver. 25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And in the morning, at great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed. Our Lord thus prepared himself by prayer for his first departure on a missionary tour. This would be the morning of the first day of the week. A great while before day he left the scene of excitement. That was not a time for preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom. The miracles attracted attention to him, but they were not the object for which he came. They were necessary as means of stirring and awakening men's minds, and of fixing their attention upon him and upon the great salvation which he came to reveal. So he left the miracles to do their subordinate work; and he himself went into a desert place, that he might pray with more quiet and less distraction. He retired that he might escape the applause of men, which they were ready to lavish upon him after seeing so many miracles; that he might thus teach us to shun the praise of men. Let us learn from Christ to give the early morning to prayer, and to rise with the dawn of day, that we may have time for meditation, and give the firstfruits of the morning to God. The early morning is favorable for study; but it is specially dear to God and his angels.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Simon and they that were with him followed after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And Simon and they that were with him followed after him κατεδίωξαν the word implies an \"earnest pursuing.\" They that were with him would doubtless include Andrew and James and John, and probably others whose enthusiasm had been kindled by Simon Peter. St. Luke, in the parallel passage (Luke 4:42). tells us that \"the multitudes sought after him, and came unto him, and would have stayed him, that he should not go from them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - All are seeking thee. The \"thee\" is here emphatic (πάντες ζητοῦσίσε).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38, 39. - These two verses indicate the extent and duration of our Lord's first missionary journey. It must have been considerable. He preached in the synagogues. This would be on successive sabbaths. According to Josephus, Galilee was a densely populated district, with upwards of two hundred villages, each containing several thousand inhabitants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - The healing of the leper is recorded in all the three synoptic Gospels; but St. Mark gives more full details. From St. Matthew we learn that it took place after the sermon on the mount; and yet not at the very close of his missionary circuit, St. Luke (Luke 5:12) says that the diseased man was \"full of leprosy\" (πλήρης λέπρας). The disorder was fully developed; it had spread over his whole body; he was leprous from head to foot. This leprosy was designed to be specially typical of the disease of sin. It was not infectious. It was not because it was either infectious or contagious that the leper was bidden under the Jewish Law to wars others off, in the words,\" Unclean! un-clean!\" It was in some cases hereditary. It was a very revolting disease. It was a poisoning of the springs of life. It was a living death. It was incurable by any human art or skill. It was the awful sign of sin reaching unto death; and it was cured, as sin is cured, only by the mercy and favor of God. No wonder, then, that our Lord specially displayed his power over this terrible disease, that he might thus prove his power over the still worse malady of sin. St. Mark here tells us that this leper knelt down (καὶ γονυπετῶν). St. Matthew says (Matthew 8:2) that he \"worshipped him,\" (προσεκύνει αὐτῷ); St. Luke says (Luke 5:12) that \"he fell on his face\" (πεσὼν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον). We thus see that the scriptural idea of worship is associated with some lowly posture of the body. But with this worship of the body, the leper offered also the homage of the soul. His prostration of himself before Christ was not merely a rendering of honor to an earthly being; it was a rendering of reverence to a Divine Being. For he does not say to him, \"If thou wilt ask of God, he will give it thee;\" but he says, \"If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\" It is as though he said, \"I know that thou art of equal power with the Father, and therefore supreme Lord over diseases; so that by thy word alone thou canst remove this leprosy from me. I ask, therefore, that thou wouldst be willing to do this, and then I know that the thing is done.\" The leper had faith in the Divine power of Christ, partly out of his own inward illumination, and partly by the evidence of the miracles which Christ had already wrought. If thou wilt, thou east. Observe the hypothetic expression, \"If thou wilt.\" He has no doubt as to Christ's power, but the words, \"If thou wilt\" show that his desire for healing was controlled by resignation to the will of God. For bodily diseases are often necessary for the health of the soul; and this God knows, though man knows it not. Therefore, in asking for earthly blessings, it behoves us to resign ourselves to the will and wisdom of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Observe in this verse that Jesus stretched forth his hand and touched the leper. Thus he showed that he was superior to the Law, which forbade contact with a leper. He touched him, knowing that he could not be defiled with the touch. He touched him that he might heal him, and that his Divine power of healing might be made manifest. \"Thus,\" says Bode, \"God stretched out his hand and touched the human nature in his incarnation, and restored to the Church those who had been cast out, that they might be able to offer their bodies a living sacrifice to him of whom it is said, 'Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Molchisedec.'\" I will; be thou clean; literally, be thou made clean (καθαρίσθητι). It is well observed here by St. Jerome that our Lord aptly answers both the petitions of the leper. \"If thou wilt;\" \"I will.\" \"Thou canst make me clean;\" \"Be thou made clean.\" Indeed, Christ gives him more than he asks for. He makes him whole, not only in body, but in spirit. Thus Christ, in his loving-kindness, exceeds the wishes of his supplicants, that we may learn from him to do the same, and to enlarge our hearts, both towards God and towards our brethren.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Straightway - St. Mark's favourite word - the leprosy departed from him. There is no interval between the command and the work of Christ. \"He spake, and it was done.\" His will is his omnipotence. By this act Christ showed that he came into the world as a great Physician, that he might cure all diseases, and cleanse us from all our defilements. The word \"straightway\" shows that Christ healed the leper, not by any natural means, but by a Divine power which works instantly. He is alike powerful both to commend and to do. St. Matthew says here (Matthew 8:3) that straightway \"his leprosy was cleansed\" (ἐκαθαρίσθη αὐτοῦ ἡ λέπρα). There is here what is called a \"hypallage,\" or inversion of the meaning, which is, of course, that \"he was cleansed from his leprosy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And he straitly charged him. The Greek verb here (ἐμβριμησάμενος) has a tinge of severity in it, \"he strictly [or sternly] charged him.\" Both word and action are severe. He straightway sent him out (ἐξεβάλεν αὐτὸν). It may be that he had incurred this rebuke by coming so near with his defilement to the holy Saviour. Christ thus showed not only his respect for the ordinances of the Jewish Law, but also how hateful sin is to the most holy God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - See thou say nothing to any man. St. Chrysostom says that our Lord gave him this charge, \"to shun ostentation, and to teach us not to boast of our virtues, but to hide them.\" It is evident that he wished to draw the thoughts of men away from his miracles, and to fix them upon his doctrine. Go thy way, show thyself to the priest; the priest who in the order of his course presided over the rest. Our Lord sent him to the priest, that he might be seen to recognize their special office in cases of leprosy; and further, that the priest himself might have clear evidence that this leper was cleansed, not after the custom of the Law, but by the operation of grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark1:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter. It seems difficult to blame the man for doing what he thought must tend to the honor of his Healer; though, no doubt, it would have been better if he had humbly obeyed. And yet it was to be expected that the knowledge of our Lord's mighty works would be published by others. In this particular instance the effect of this man's conduct was probably unexpected by himself; for it led to the withdrawal of Christ from Capernaum. The crowds who were attracted to him by the fame of his miracles would have hampered him, so that he could not have exercised his ministry; for even in the desert places they sought him out, and came to him from every quarter. It should be noticed here that this first chapter of St. Mark embraces, in very condensed form, about twelve months of our Lord's public ministry, from his baptism by John. And it is a record of uninterrupted progress. The time had not then come for the opposition of the scribes and Pharisees and Herodians to show itself. It was, no doubt, wisely ordained that his gospel should take root and lay hold of the hearts and consciences of men, as it must have done in the minds of the Galilaeans more especially, before it had to encounter the envy and malice of those who ultimately would bring him to his cross.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd again he entered into Capernaum, after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The first sentence of this verse is better rendered thus: And when he entered again (εἰσελθῶν πάλιν) into Capernaum after some days; literally, after days (δι ἡμερῶν). It is probable that a considerable interval had taken place since the events recorded in the former chapter. It was noised that he was in the house (ὅτι εἰς οϊκόν ἐστὶ); or, if the ὅτι be regarded as recitative, it was noised, He is in the house, at home, in his usual place of residence at Capernaum.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them (ὥστε μηκέτι χωρεῖν), no, not even about the door. The description is very graphic. The house could not contain them, and even its courtyard and approaches were inconveniently thronged. This is one of the many examples of minute observation of details, so observable in St. Mark's Gospel. And he preached (ἐλάλει) - more literally, was speaking - the word unto them. This little sentence indicates the great object of his ministry. The exercise of miraculous power was subordinated to this; the miracles being simply designed to fix the attention upon the Teacher as One sent from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - And they come, bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy, borne of four. Here again the minuteness of detail is very observable. It is also interesting to notice how the three writers of the synoptic Gospels supplement and illustrate one another. St. Matthew gives the outline, St. Mark and St. Luke fill up the picture. St. Luke (Luke 5:18) tells us how they sought means to bring the paralytic into Christ's presence. They carried him on his bed up the flight of steps outside the house, and reaching to the roof; and then both St. Mark and St. Luke tell us how, having first removed a portion of the tiling and broken up the roof, they then let him down through the opening thus made into the midst before Jesus. The chamber into which he was thus abruptly lowered was most probably what is elsewhere called the \"upper chamber,\" a large central room, convenient for the purpose of addressing both those who filled it and also the crowd that thronged the outer court below.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Son, thy sins be forgiven thee; literally, thy sins are forgiven. The word \"son\" is in the Greek the more endearing word (τέκνον) \"child.\" St. Luke uses the word \"man.\" St. Matthew adds the words \"Be of good cheer.\" It is here to be carefully observed that the spiritual gift, the gift of forgiveness, is first conveyed; and we must also notice the authoritative character of the address, \"Thy sins are forgiven.\" Bede observes here that our Lord first forgives his sins, that he might show him that his suffering was ultimately due to sin. Bede also says that he was borne of four, to show that a man is carried onwards by four graces to the assured hope of healing, namely, by prudence, and courage, and righteousness, and temperance. Jesus seeing their faith. Some of the Fathers, as Jerome and Ambrose, think that this faith was in the behavers of the sick man, and in them only. But there is nothing in the words to limit them in this way. Indeed, it would seem far more natural to suppose that the paralytic must have been a consenting party. He must have approved of all that they did, otherwise we can hardly suppose that it would have been done. We may therefore more reasonably conclude, with St. Chrysostom, that it was alike their faith and his that our Lord crowned with his blessing. Thy sins are forgiven. These words of our Lord were not a mere wish only; they were this sick man's sentence of absolution. They were far more than the word of absolution which Christ's ambassadors are authorized to deliver to all those who \"truly repent and unfeignedly believe.\" For Christ could read the heart, which they cannot do. And therefore his sentence is absolute, and not conditional only. It is not the announcement of a qualified gift, but the assertion of an undoubted fact. In his own name, and by his own inherent power, he there and then forgives the man his sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - The words, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? in accordance with the altered reading (βλασφημεῖ for βλασφημίας), should stand thus: Why doth this man thus speak? he blasphemeth. It is evident that the scribes, who were secretly amongst themselves finding fault with our Lord's words, understood that, by the use of these words, our Lord was assuming to himself a Divine attribute. And if he had been a mere man; if he had not really been, as he assumed to be, Divine, the only begotten Son of the Father, - then no doubt they would have been right in supposing that he blasphemed. But their error was that they could not perceive in him the glory of the only begotten Son. The light was shining in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-11. - It does not clearly appear whether these murmurers communicated their thoughts audibly to one another. At all events, their words were evidently not heard beyond themselves. But Jesus perceived in his spirit their reasonings. He knew their thoughts, not by communication from another, as the prophets of old had things made known to them by revelation, but by his own Spirit pervading and penetrating all things. From this the Christian Fathers, against the Arians, infer the divinity of Christ, that he inspected the heart, which it is the prerogative of God alone to do. St. Chrysostom says, \"Behold the evidences of the divinity of Christ. Observe that he knows the very secrets of your heart.\" Nor did Christ only perceive their thoughts. He perceived also the direction in which these thoughts were moving. Their feeling was no doubt this: \"It is an easy thing to claim the power of forgiving sin, since this is a power which cannot be challenged by any outward sign.\" Now, it is to this form of unbelief that the next words of our Lord are the answer. It is as though he said, \"You accuse me of blasphemy. You say that I am usurping the attributes of God when I claim the power of forgiving sin. You ask for the evidence that I really possess this power; and you say it is an easy thing to lay claim to a power which penetrates the spiritual world, and which is therefore beyond the reach of material proof. Be it so. I will now furnish that evidence. I will prove, by what I am now about to work upon the body, that what I have just said is effectual upon the spirit. I have just said to this paralytic, 'Thy sins are forgiven.' You challenge this power; you question my authority. I will now give you outward and sensible evidence that this is no fictitious or imaginary claim. You see this poor helpless, palsied man. I will say to him in presence of you all, ' Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.' And if simply at my bidding his nerves are braced, and his limbs gather strength, and he rises and walks, then judge ye whether I have a right to say to him, 'Thy sins are forgiven.' Thus, by doing that which is capable of proof, I will vindicate my power to do that which is beyond the reach of sensible evidence; and I will make manifest to you, by these visible tides of my grace, in what direction the deep under-current of my love is moving.\" (See Trench on the Miracles, p. 205.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The words are spoken, and the paralytic arose, and straightway took up the bed (ἠγέρθή καὶ εὐθὺς ἄρας) - such is the most approved reading - and went forth before them all. There is a spiritual application of this miracle which it is well to notice. The paralytic lifting up himself is a figure of him who, in the strength of Christ, has lifted himself up from the lethargy of sin. He has first applied to Christ, perhaps by his own sense of his need, perhaps with the help of others. He may have had difficulty in approaching him. A multitude of sinful thoughts and cares may have thronged the door. But at length, whether alone or with the kind assistance of faithful friends, he has been brought to the feet of Jesus, and has heard those words of love and power, \"Thy sins are forgiven thee.\" And then he will rise and walk. He will take up that whereon he lay. He will carry away those things whereon he has hitherto found satisfaction - his love of ease, his self-indulgence. His bed, whatever it may have been whereon he lay, becomes the proof of his cure. When the intemperate man becomes sober, the passionate man gentle, and the covetous man liberal, he takes up that whereon he lay. Thus does each penitent man begin a new life; setting forward with new hopes and new powers towards his true home, eternal in the heavens. We are not informed of the effect of this miracle upon the scribes and Pharisees. But it is too evident that, though they could not deny the fact, they would not acknowledge the power; while the mass of the people, more free from prejudice, and therefore more open to conviction, united in giving glory to God. Faith in Christ as sent by God was in fact increasing amongst the mass of the people; while unbelief was working its deadly result of envy and malice amongst those who ought to have been their guides and instructors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - It is probable that our Lord remained some time at Capernaum before he went forth again. The word \"again\" refers to his former going forth (see Mark 1:35). When he went forth on this occasion he appears to have traveled southwards along the sea-shore. There, not far from Capernaum, he saw Levi, the son of Alphseus, sitting at the receipt of custom (ἐπὶ τὸ τελώνιον); more literally, at the place of toll. This place would be in the direct line for traders from Damascus to Accho, and a convenient spot for the receipt of the duties on the shipping. It is observable that in St. Matthew's own Gospel (Matthew 9:9) he describes himself as \"a man named Matthew.\" St. Luke, like St. Mark, calls him Levi. The same person is no doubt meant. It is most likely that his original name was Levi, and that upon his call to be an apostle he received a new name, that of Matthew, or Mattathias, which, according to Gesenius, means \"the gift of Jehovah.\" In his own Gospel he names himself Matthew, that he might proclaim the kindness and love of Christ towards him, in the spirit of St. Paul, where he says, \"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief\" (1 Timothy 1:15). Follow me; me, that is, whom you have already heard preaching the gospel of the kingdom in Capernaum, and confirming it by many miracles, and especially by that conspicuous miracle spoken of by all, the healing of the paralytic. St. Chrysostom says that \"our Lord called Matthew, who was already constrained by the report of his miracles.\" The condescension of Christ is shown in this, that he called Matthew the \"publican,\" who on that account was odious to the Jews, not only to be a partaker of his grace, but to be one of his chosen followers, a friend, an apostle, and an evangelist. It has been urged against the truth of Christianity, by Porphyry and others, that the first disciples followed Christ blindly, as though they would have followed without reason any one who called them. But they were not men who acted upon mere impulse and without reason. The miracles, no doubt, produced an impression upon them. And then we may reasonably suppose that their moral faculties perceived the majesty of Deity shining through the countenance of the Son of God. As the magnet attracts the iron, so Christ drew Matthew and others to himself; and by this attractive power he communicated his graces and virtues to them, such as an ardent love of God, contempt of the world, and burning zeal for the salvation of souls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And it came to pass - ἐγένετο seems the best reading - as he was sitting at meat in his house. This was the house of Matthew. St. Matthew (Matthew 9:10) modestly says, \"in the house,\" keeping himself as much as possible in the background. St. Luke, with greater fullness, says (Luke 5:29) that \"Levi made him a great feast in his house.\" From this it appears that Matthew at once marked the occasion of his call by inviting his associates, publicans and sinners, that they too, being won by the example and teaching of Christ, might be led in like manner to follow him. Good is ever diffusive of itself; and Christian love prompts those who have experienced the love of Christ to draw others to the same fountain of mercy. We find publicans and sinners constantly associated together; for, although there is nothing necessarily unlawful in the office of a tax-gatherer, yet, since men frequently followed that calling because it offered the opportunity for fraud and extortion, hence the \"publicans\" were, generally speaking, odious to the Jews, and regarded as nothing better than \"sinners.\" More-over the Jews of old maintained that they were Abraham's seed, and protested that as a people dedicated to God, they ought not to be subject to the Romans, who were Gentiles and idolaters. They considered that it was contrary to the liberty and dignity of the children of God that they should pay tribute to them, a view which increased their prejudice against the tax-gatherers. And indeed this was one main cause of the rebellion of the Jews, which led finally to their overthrow by Titus and Vespasian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - According to the most approved readings, this verse should run thus: And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said unto his disciples, He eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners. The words \"publicans and sinners\" are thus inverted in their order in the two clauses, as though they were convertible terms. Of course, the scribes and Pharisees had not sat down at this feast, but some of them had probably found their way into the chamber in which the feast was going on, where they would comment freely upon what they saw, and condemn our Lord's conduct as inconsistent with his character. It is as though they said, \"By this conduct he transgresses the Law of God and the traditions of the elders. Why, then, do you follow him?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Jesus heard their murmurings, and his answer was, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. As the physician is not infected by the disease of the patient, but rather overcomes it and drives it from him, so it is no disgrace but rather an honor to the physician to associate himself with the sick, and so much the more, the greater the sickness. So that it is as though Christ said, \"I who am sent from heaven by the Father, that I might be the Physician of the souls of sinners, am not defiled by their sins and spiritual diseases when I converse with them; but rather I cure and heal them, which is alike for my glory and for their good, and so much the more, the greater their sins. For I am the physician of sinners, not their companion. But you, scribes and Pharisees, are not the physicians but the companions of sinners, and so you are contaminated. Nevertheless, you desire to be thought righteous and holy; and therefore I do not associate with you,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because the whole, such as you think yourselves to be, need not the spiritual Physician; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because your insincerity and pocrisy are an offense to me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The first sentence of this verse should be rendered thus: And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting (ῆσαν νηστεύ´οντες). In all the synoptic Gospels we find this incident following closely upon what goes before. It is not improbable that the Pharisees and the disciples of John were fasting at the very time when Matthew gave his feast. This was not one of the fasts prescribed by the Law; had it been so, it would have been observed by our Lord. There were, however, fasts observed by the Pharisees which were not required by the Law; there were two in particular of a voluntary nature, mentioned by the Pharisee (Luke 18:12), where he says, \"I fast twice in the week.\" It was a custom, observed by the stricter Pharisees, but not of legal obligation. It was not correct to say, but thy disciples fast not. They fasted, no doubt, but in a different spirit; they did not fast to be seen of men - they followed the higher teaching of their Master. It is remarkable to find the disciples of John here associated with the Pharisees. John was now in prison in the fort of Machaerus. It is possible that jealousy of the increasing influence of Christ may have led John's disciples to associate themselves with the Pharisees. The point of this particular attack upon Christ was this: It is as though they said, \"You claim to be a new teacher sent from God, a teacher of a more perfect religion. How is it, then, that we are fasting, while your disciples are eating and drinking?\" The disciples of John more especially may have urged this out of zeal for their master. Such an unworthy zeal is too often seen in good men, who love to prefer their own leader to all others, forgetting the remonstrance of St. Paul, \"While there is amongst you strife and contention, are ye not carnal, and walk after the manner of men?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The Bridegroom here is Christ, because he espoused the human nature, and, through it, the Church to himself in his holy incarnation. This holy union he began by his grace on earth, and he will consummate it gloriously with his elect in heaven, when \"the marriage of the Lamb shall have come, and his wife shall have made herself ready.\" Hence John the Baptist calls himself the friend of the Bridegroom, that is, of Christ. The sons (υἱοὶ) of the bridechamber are the special friends of the Bridegroom, those who are admitted into the closest fellowship with him. The expression is a Hebraism, like \"the children of disobedience,\" and many other similar forms of expression. So long, then, as the bridegroom is with them they cannot fast. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast. It is as though our Lord said, \"It is not surprising that they should not care to fast as long as they enjoy my presence; but when I am taken from thegn, then shall they fast.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This is the first occasion on which our Lord alludes to his removal from them. The bridegroom shall be taken away from them. The Greek word (ἀπαρθῇ) conveys the idea of a painful severance. And then will they fast in that day (ἐν ἐκείνῇ τῇ ἡμέρα). This is the true reading. After our Lord's death, his disciples frequently fasted as of necessity, and went through much privation and trial. And so it must be for the most part with all who will live godly in Christ Jesus, until he returns to take to himself his kingdom, when there will be a glad and everlasting festival.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - No man seweth a piece of new cloth - the Greek is (ῤακους ἀγνάφου) undressed cloth, cloth newly woven, and before it has been dressed by the fuller - on an old garment. The latter part of this verse is better rendered, as in the Revised Version, thus: Else that which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old; and a worse rent is made. The meaning of the words is this: An old garment, if it be torn, should be mended by a patch of old material; for if a patch of new material is used, its strength or fullness takes away from the old garment to which it is sewn; the old and the new do not agree, the new drags the old and tears it, and so a worse rent is made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - \"Bottles\" in this verse is better rendered literally wine-skins (ἀσκούς). And no man putteth new wine (οϊνον νέον) into old wine-skins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine perisheth, and the skins; but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins (ἀσκοὺς καινοὺς). The sense is this: New wine, in the process of fermentation, will burst old bottles made of wine-skins not strong enough to resist the strength of the fermenting fluid; so that there is a twofold loss - both that of the bottles and that of the wine. And therefore new wine must be poured into bottles made of fresh wine-skins, which, by reason of their strength and toughness, shall be able to resist the fermenting energy of the new wine. And by these very apt illustrations our Lord teaches us that it is a vain thing to attempt to mingle together the spiritual freedom of the gospel with the old ceremonies of the Law. To attempt to engraft the living spiritual energy of the gospel upon the old legal ceremonial now about to pass away, would be as fatal a thing as to piece an old garment with new material, or to put new wine into old wineskins. There is here, therefore, a valuable lesson for the Christian Church, namely, to treat new converts with gentleness and consideration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - If there is a rapid sequence in this part of the narrative, the fasting referred to in the last verses may have taken place the day before. St. Luke (Luke 6:1) here adds to St. Mark's account the words, \"and did eat, rubbing them [that is, the ears of corn] in their hands;\" an incidental evidence of a simple life, that they did not here eat prepared food, but the simple grains of wheat, which they separated from the chaff by rubbing the ears of corn in their hands. This passage marks with some nicety the time of the year. The corn in that district would be ripening about May. It would, therefore, be not long after the Passover. The difficult expression in St. Luke 6:1, ἐν σαββάτῳ δευτεροπρώτῳ, and which is rendered in the Authorized Version \"on the second sabbath after the first,\" is reduced by the Revisers of 1881 to the simple phrase (ἐν σαββάτῳ), \"on a sabbath,\" there not being sufficient evidence to persuade them to retain the word δευτεροπρώτῳ. But other evidences seem to show that the incident occurred earlier than as recorded by St. Matthew. The Fathers are fond of spiritual applications of this rubbing of the ears of corn. Bede, in remarking upon the fact of the disciples plucking the ears of corn, and rubbing them until they get rid of the husks, and obtain the food itself, says that they do this who meditate upon the Holy Scriptures, and digest them, until they find in them the kernel, the quintessence of delight; and St. Augustine blames those who merely please themselves with the flowers of Holy Scripture, but do not rub out the grain by meditation, until they obtain the real nourishment of virtue.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - That which is not lawful. The supposed unlawfulness was not the plucking of the ears of corn with the hand, which was expressly permitted by the Law (Deuteronomy 23:25), but the plucking and eating on the sabbath day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - David... and they that were with him. This seems opposed to what we read in 1 Samuel 21, where David is stated to have been alone. But the facts appear to have been these, that David, fleeing from Saul, went alone to Ahimelech the high priest, and sought and obtained five loaves of the \"shewbread,\" which he carried away with him to his companions in flight, and shared with them; for he says (1 Samuel 21:2), \"I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.\" This incident actually happened in the high priesthood of Ahimelech the father of Abiathar. Bede says that they were both present when David came in his distress and obtained the shewbread. But Ahimelech having been slain, together with eighty-six priests, by Saul, Abiathar fled to David, and became his companion in his exile. Moreover, when he succeeded to the high priesthood on the death of Ahimelech, he did far more good service than his father had done, and so was worthy of being spoken of with this special commendation, and as though he was actually high priest, even though his father was then living. The words may properly mean \"in the days when Abiathar was living who became high priest, and was more eminent than his father.\" The shewbread; literally, the bread of the face, that is, of the Divine presence, symbolizing the Divine Being who is the Bread of life. It was directed by the Law that within the sanctuary there should be a table of shittim (or acacia) wood; and every sabbath twelve newly baked loaves were placed upon it in two rows. These leaves were sprinkled with incense, and then remained there until the following sabbath. They were then replaced by twelve newly baked loaves, the old loaves being eaten by the priests in the holy place, from which it was unlawful to remove them. These twelve loaves corresponded to the twelve tribes. The force of our Lord's reasoning is this: David, a man after God's own heart, when sorely pressed by hunger, applied to the high priest and took some of these sacred loaves, loaves which under ordinary circumstances it was not lawful for the lay people to eat, because he wisely judged that a positive law, forbidding the laity to eat this bread, ought to yield to a law of necessity and of nature; which intimates to us that in a grave necessity of famine, life may be lawfully preserved by eating even sacred bread which has been dedicated to God. Therefore, in like manner, nay, much more, was it lawful for Christ and his disciples to pluck the ears of corn on the sabbath day, that by rubbing them in their hands they might pick out the good grain and satisfy their hunger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The sabbath was instituted for the benefit of man, that he might refresh and renew his body, fatigued and worn by six days' labour, with the restful calm of the seventh; and that he might have leisure to apply his mind to the things which concern his everlasting salvation; to consider and meditate upon the Law of God; and rouse himself, by the remembrance of the Divine greatness and goodness, to true repentance, to gratitude, and to love. The force of the argument is this: The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath. The sabbath, great and important as that institution is, is subordinate to man. If, then, the absolute rest of the sabbath becomes hurtful to man, a new departure must be taken, and some amount of labour must be undergone, that man may be benefited. Therefore was Christ justified in permitting to his disciples a little labour in plucking these ears of corn on the sabbath day, in order that they may appease their hunger. For it is better that the rest of the sabbath should be disturbed, though but a little, than that any one of those for whose sake the sabbath was instituted should perish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. \"The sabbath was made for man.\" It is the inferior institution, man being the higher, for whose sake the sabbath was appointed. But the Son of man is Lord of all men, and of all things that pertain to man's salvation; therefore he must of necessity be Lord even of the sabbath; so that when he sees fit he can relax or dispense with its obligations. It is true that for us Christians the first day of the week, the Lord's day, has taken the place of the ancient Jewish sabbath; but the principle here laid down by our Lord is applicable to the \"first\" day no less than to the \"seventh;\" and it teaches us that our own moral and religious advancement and that of our brethren is the object which we should all aim at in the manner of our observance of the Christian Sunday; while we strive to \"stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - He entered again into the synagogue. St. Matthew (Matthew 12:9) says, \"their synagogue\" (εἰς τὴν συναγωγὴν) This would probably be on the next sabbath after that named at the close of the last chapter. And there was a man there which had a withered hand (ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα); literally, which had his hand withered, or dried up. And they watched him (παρετήρουν αὐτὸν); kept watching him. There were probably scribes sent for this purpose from Jerusalem. St. Jerome informs us that in an apocryphal Gospel in use amongst the Nazarenes and Ebionites, the man whose hand was withered is described as a mason, and is said to have asked for help in the following terms: - \"I was a mason, seeking my living by manual labour. I beseech thee, Jesus, to restore me the use of my hand, that I may not be compelled to beg my bread.\" This is so far consistent with St. Mark's description (ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα) as to show that the malady was the result of disease or accident, and not congenital. St. Luke (Luke 6:6) informs us that it was the right hand. The disease probably extended through the whole arm according to the wider meaning of the Greek word It seems to have been a kind of atrophy, causing a gradual drying up of the limb; which in such a condition was beyond the reach of any mere human skill.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The scribes had already the evidence that our Lord had permitted his disciples to rub the ears of corn on the sabbath day. But this was the act of the disciple, not his. What he was now preparing to do was an act of miraculous power. And here the ease was stronger, because work, which was prohibited under pain of death by the Law (Exodus 31:14), was understood to include every act not absolutely necessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - Stand forth. The words in the original are Ἔγειραι εἰς τὸ μέσον Rise into the midst. In St. Matthew's account (Matthew 12:10), the scribes and Pharisees here ask our Lord, \"Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?\" The two accounts are easily reconciled if we first suppose the scribes and Pharisees to ask this question of our Lord, and then our Lord to answer them by putting their own question to them in another form. Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? Our Lord's meaning appears to be this: \"If any one, baying it in his power, omits to do an act of mercy on the sabbath day-for one grievously afflicted, as this man is, if he is able to cure him, as I Christ am able, he does him a wrong; for he denies him that help which he owes him by the law of charity.\" Our Lord thus plainly signifies that not to do an act of kindness to a sick man on the sabbath day when you are able to do it, is really to do him a wrong. But it is never lawful to do a wrong; and therefore it is always lawful to do good, not excepting even the sabbath day, for that is dedicated to God and to good works. Whence it is a greater sin to do a wrong on the sabbath than on other days; for thus the sanctity of the sabbath is violated, just as it is all the more honoured and sanctified by doing good. In our Lord's judgment, then, to neglect to save, when you have it in your power to do so, is to destroy. They held their peace. They could not answer him. They are obstinate indeed in their infidelity, who, when they can say nothing against the truth, refuse to say anything for it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - When he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved συλλυπούμενος) - the word has a touch of \"condolence\" in it - at the hardening of their heart. All this is very characteristic of St. Mark, who is careful to notice the visible expression of our Lord's feelings in his looks. The account is evidently from an eye-witness, or from one who had it from an eye-witness. He looked round about on them with anger. He was indignant at their blindness of heart, and their unbelief, which led them to attack the miracles of mercy wrought by him on the sabbath day as though they were a violation of the law of the sabbath. We see here how plainly there were in Christ the passions and affections common to the human nature, only restrained and subordinated to reason. Hero is the difference between the anger of fallen man and the anger of the sinless One. With fallen man, auger is the desire of retaliating, of punishing those by whom you consider yourself unjustly treated. Hence, in other men, anger springs from self-love; in Christ it sprang from the love of God. He loved God above all things; hence he was distressed and irritated on account of the wrongs done to God by sins and sinners. So that his anger was a righteous zeal for the honour of God; and hence it was mingled with grief, because, in their blindness and obstinacy, they would not acknowledge him to be the Messiah, but misrepresented his kindnesses wrought on the sick on the sabbath day, and found fault with them as evil. Thus our Lord, by showing grief and sorrow, makes it plain that his anger did not spring from the desire of revenge. He was indeed angry at the sin, while he grieved over and with the sinners, as those whom he loved, and for whose sake he came into the world that he might redeem and save them. Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored. The words \"whole as the other\" (הללאְ ץה שׁץו שׁםהגִץֻ) are not found in the best uncials. They were probably inserted from St. Matthew. In this instance our Lord performed no outward act. \"He spake, and it was done.\" The Divine power wrought the miracle concurrently with the act of faith on the part of the man in obeying the command.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Pharisees and the Herodians combine together against the Lord. This was a terrible crisis in his history, or rather in the history of those unbelieving men. They are now in this dilemma: they must either accept his teaching, or they must take steps against him as a sabbath-breaker. But what had he done? The miracle had been wrought by a word only. It would have been difficult, therefore, to have obtained a judgment against him. Therefore they secured some fresh allies. They had already gained to their side some of the disciples of John the Baptist (Mark 2:18), now they associate with themselves the Herodians. This is the first mention that we find made of the Herodians. They were the natural opponents of the Pharisees; but here they seem to have found some common ground of agreement, though it is not very easy to say what it was, in combining against our Lord. But it is no uncommon thing to find coalitions of men, strangely opposed to one another on most points, but united to effect some particular object; and it is easy to see how the purity and spirituality of our Lord and of his doctrine would be opposed, on the one hand, to the ceremonial formality of the Pharisee, and on the other to the worldly and secular spirit of the Herodian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea. This shows that the miracle just recorded took place in the interior of Galilee, and not at Capernaum, which was close by the sea. The chief city in Galilee at that time was Sepphoris, which Herod Antipas had made his capital. There the Herodiaus would of course be numerous, and so too would the Pharisees; since that city was one of the five places where the five Sanhedrims met (see Reland, 'Palestine,' p. 100, referred to in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' in lee.). The remainder of these two verses should be read and pointed thus: And a great multitude from Galilee followed: and from Judaea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, come unto him. The meaning of the evangelist is this, that, in addition to the great multitude that followed him from the parts of Galilee which he had just been visiting, there were vast numbers from other parts who had now heard of his fame, and flocked to him from every quarter. This description sets before us in a strikingly graphic manner the mixed character of the multitude who gathered around our Lord to listen to his teaching, and to be healed by him - as many, at least, as had need of healing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship (πλοιάριον) - literally, a little boat - should wait on him προσκαρτερῆ αὐτῷ) - literally, should be in close attendance upon him - because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. This shows in a very graphic manner how assiduously and closely the crowd pressed upon him, so that he was obliged to have a little boat always in readiness, in which he might take refuge when the pressure became too great, and so address them with greater freedom from the boat. St. Luke (Luke 5:3) says, \"He sat down, and taught the people out of the ship,\" making the boat, so to speak, his pulpit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As many as had plagues - the Greek word is μάστιγας; literally, scourges, painful disorders - pressed upon him (ὥστε ἐπιπίπτειν αὐτῷ); literally, fell upon him, clung to him, hoping that the very contact with him might heal them. This expression, \"scourges,\" reminds us that diseases are a punishment on account of our sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying. It is worthy of notice that the afflicted people fell upon him (ἐπίπιπτειν αὐτῷ); but the unclean spirits felt down before him (προσέπιπτεν αὐτῷ), and this not out of love or devotion, but out of abject fear, dreading lest he should drive them out of the \"possessed,\" and send them before their time to their destined torment. It is just possible that this homage paid to our Lord may have been an act of cunning - a ruse, as it were, to lead the people to suppose that our Lord was in league with evil spirits. Thou art the Son of God. Did, then, the unclean spirits really know that Jesus was the Son of God? A voice from heaven at his baptism had proclaimed him to be the Son of God, and that voice must have vibrated through the spiritual world. Then, further, they must have known him to be the Son of God by the numerous and mighty miracles which he wrought, and which they must have seen [o be real miracles, such as could only have been wrought by the supernatural power of God, and which were wrought by Christ for this very purpose, that they might prove him to be the promised Messiah, the only begotten Son of God. It may, however, be observed that they did not know this so clearly, but that, considering, on the other hand, the greatness of the mystery, they hesitated. It is probable that they were ignorant of the end and fruit of this great mystery, namely, that mankind were to be redeemed by the Incarnation, the Cross, and the Death of Christ; and so their own kingdom was to be overthrown, and the kingdom of God established. Blinded by their hatred of Jesus, whom they perceived to be a most holy Being, drawing multitudes to himself, they stirred up the passions of evil men against him, little dreaming that in promoting his destruction they were overthrowing their own kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - (See notes on Mark 1:44.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Into a mountain; literally, into the mountain (εἰς τὸ ὄρος). Similarly, St. Luke (Luke 6:12) says,\" He went out into the mountain to pray.\" The use of the definite article might either point to some well-known eminence, or to the high table-land as distinguished from the plain, and in which there would be many recesses, which would explain the use of the preposition Tradition indicates Mount Hatten as the place, about five miles to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The summit rises above a level space, where large numbers might stand within hearing. It is supposed, with good reason, that it was from thence that the sermon on the mount was delivered. It was at daybreak, as we learn from St. Luke (Luke 6:13), after this night of prayer, that he called unto him whom he himself would (ου{ς ἤθελεν αὐτός): and they went unto him (καὶ ἀπῆλθον πρὸς); literally, they went away to him, the word implying that they forsook their former pursuits. His own will was the motive power: he called \"whom he himself would;\" but their will consented. \"When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will seek.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - Out of those who thus came to him, he ordained twelve literally, he made or appointed twelve. They were not solemnly ordained or consecrated to their office until after his resurrection. Their actual consecration (of all of them at least but one, namely, Judas Iscariot) took place when he breathed on them and said, \"Receive ye the Holy Ghost\" (John 20:22). But from this time they were his apostles \"designate.\" They were henceforth to Be with him as his attendants and disciples. They were to go forth and preach under his direction, and by his power they were to cast out devils. Several manuscripts add here that they were \"to heal sicknesses,\" but the words are emitted in some of the oldest authorities. The authority over unclean spirits is more formally conveyed later on (see Mark 6:7), so that here St. Mark speaks by anticipation. But this shows how much importance was attached to this part of their mission; for it recognizes the spiritual world, and the special purpose of the manifestation of the Son of God, namely, that he might \"destroy the works of the devil.\" He appointed twelve. The number twelve symbolizes perfection and universality. The number three indicates what is Divine; and the number four, created things. Three multiplied by four gives twelve, the number of those who were to go forth as apostles into the four quarters of the world - called to the faith of the holy Trinity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Simon he surnamed Peter;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - And Simon he surnamed Peter. Our Lord had previously declared that Simon should be so called. But St. Mark avoids as much as possible the recognition of any special honor belonging to St. Peter; so he here simply mentions the fact of this surname having been given to him, a fact which was necessary in order that he might be identified. All the early Christian writers held that Peter was virtually the author of this Gospel. Simon, or Simeon, is from a Hebrew word, meaning \"to hear.\" James the son of Zebedee, so called to distinguish him from the other James; and John his brother. In St. Matthew's list, Andrew is mentioned next after Peter, as his brother, and the first called. But here St. Mark mentions James and John first after Peter; these three, Peter and James and John, being the three leading apostles. Of James and John, James is mentioned first, as the eldest of the two brothers. And them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder. \"Boanerges\" is the Aramaic pronunciation of the Hebrew B'ne-ragesh; B'ne, sons, and ragesh, thunder. The word was not intended as a term of reproach; although it fitly expressed that natural impetuosity and vehemence of character, which showed itself in their desire to bring down fire from heaven upon the Samaritan village, and in their ambitious request that they might have the highest places of honor in his coming kingdom. But their natural dispositions, under the Holy Spirit's influence, were gradually transformed so as to serve the cause of Christ, and their fiery zeal was transmuted into the steady flame of Christian earnestness and love, so as to become an element of great power in their new life as Christians. Christ called these men \"Sons of thunder\" because he would make their natural dispositions, when restrained and elevated by his grace, the great instruments of spreading his Gospel. He destined them for high service in his kingdom. By their holy lives they were to be as lightning, and by their preaching they were to be as thunder to rouse unbelievers, and to bring them to repentance and a holy life. It was no doubt on account of this zeal that James fell so early a victim to the wrath of Herod. A different lot was that which fell to St. John. Spared to a ripe old age, he influenced the early Church by his writings and his teaching. His Gospel begins as with the voice of thunder, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" Beza and others, followed by Dr. Morisen, have thought that this distinctive name was given by our Lord to the two brothers on account of some deep-toned peculiarity of voice, which was of much service to them in impressing the message of the Gospel of the kingdom upon their hearers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - Andrew is next mentioned after these eminent apostles, as the first called. The word is from the Greek, and means \"manly.\" Bartholomew, that is, Bar-tolmai, the son of Tolmay. This is a patronymic, and not a proper name. It has been with good reason supposed that he is identical with Nathanael, of whom we first read in John 1:46, as having been found by Philip and brought to Christ. In the three synoptic Gospels we find Philip and Bartholomew enumerated together in the lists of the apostles; and certainly the mode in which Nathanael is mentioned in John 21:2 would seem to show that he was an apostle. His birthplace, too, Cana of Galilee, would point to the same conclusion. If this be so, then the name Nathanael, the \"gift of God,\" would bear the same relation to Bartholomew that Simon does to Bar-jona. Matthew. In St Matthew's own list of the apostles (Matthew 10:3) the epithet \"the publican\" is added to his name, and he places himself after Thomas. This marks the humility of the apostle, that he does not scruple to place on record what he was before he was called. The word Matthew, a contraction of Mattathias, means the \"gift of Jehovah,\" according to Gesenius, which in Greek would be \"Theodore.\" Thomas. Eusebius says that his real name was Judas. It is possible that Thomas may have been a surname. The word is Hebrew meaning a twin, and it is so rendered in Greek in John 11:16. James the son of Alphaeus, or Clopas (not Cleophas): called\" the Less,\" either because he was junior in age, or rather in his call, to James the Great, the brother of John. This James, the son of Alphaeus, is called the brother of our Lord. St. Jerome says that his father Alphaeus, or Clopas, married Mary, a sister of the blessed Virgin Mary, which would make him the cousin of our Lord. This view is confirmed by Bishop Pearson (Art. 3:on the Creed). He was the writer of the Epistle which bears his name, and he became Bishop of Jerusalem. Thaddaeus, called also Lebbaeus and Judas; whence St. Jerome describes him as \"trionimus,\" i.e. having three names. Judas would be his proper name. Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus have a kind of etymological affinity, the root of Lebbaeus being \"heart,\" and of Thaddaeus, \"breast.\" These names are probably recorded to distinguish him from Judas the traitor. Simon the Canaanite. The word in the Greek, according to the best authorities, is, both here and in St. Matthew (Matthew 10:4), Καναναῖος, from a Chaldean or Syriac word, Kanean, or Kanenieh. The Greek equivalent is Ζηλωτής, which we find preserved in St. Luke (Luke 6:15). It is possible, however, that Simon may have been born in Cana of Galilee. St. Jerome says that he was called a Cananaean or Zealot, by a double reference to the place of his birth and to his zeal. Judas Iscariot. Iscariot. The most probable derivation is from the Hebrew lsh-Kerioth, \"a man of Kerioth,' a city of the tribe of Judah. St. John (John 6:7) describes him as the son of Simon. If it be asked why our Lord should have chosen Judas Iscariot, the answer is that he chose him, although he knew that he would betray him, because it was his will that he should be betrayed by one that had been \"his own familiar friend,\" and that had \"eaten bread with him.\" Bengel says well here that \"there is an election of grace from which men may fall.\" How far our Lord knew from the first the results of his choice of Judas belongs to the profound, unfathomable mystery of the union of the Godhead and the manhood in his sacred Person. We may notice generally, with regard to this choice by our Lord of his apostles, the germ of the principle of sending them forth by two and two. Here are Peter and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, and so on. Then, again, our Lord chose three pairs of brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, James the Less and Jude, that he might teach us how powerful an influence is brotherly love. We may also observe that Christ, in selecting his apostles, chose some of his kinsmen according to the flesh. When he took upon him our flesh, he recognized those who were near to him by nature, and he would unite them yet mere closely by grace to his Divine nature. Three of the apostles took the lead, namely, Peter and James and John, who were admitted to be witnesses of his transfiguration, of one of his greatest miracles, and of his passion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - The last clause of ver. 19, And they went into an house, should form the opening sentence of a new paragraph, and should therefore become the first clause of ver. 20, as in the Revised Version. According to the most approved reading, the words are (ἐξῆλθον), He cometh into an house, or, He cometh home. There is here a considerable gap in St. Mark's narrative. The sermon on the mount followed upon the call of the apostles, at all events so far as it affected them and their mission. Moreover, St. Matthew interposes here two miracles wrought by our Lord after his descent from the mount, and before his return to his own house at Capernaum. St. Mark seems anxious here to hasten on to describe the treatment of our Lord by his own near relatives at this important crisis in his ministry. So that they - i.e., our Lord and his disciples - could not so much as eat bread; such was the pressure of the crowd upon them. St. Mark evidently records this, in order to show the contrast between the zeal of the multitude and the very different feelings of our Lord's own connections. They, his friends, when they heard how he was thronged, went out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself. This little incident is mentioned only by St. Mark. When his friends saw him so bent upon his great mission as to neglect his bodily necessities, they considered that he was bereft of his reason, that too much zeal and piety had deranged his mind. His friends went out (ἐξῆλθον) to lay hold on him. They may probably have come from Nazareth. St. John (John 7:5) says that \"even his brethren did not believe on him;\" that is, they did not believe in him with that fuiness of trust which is of the essence of true faith. Their impression was that he was in a condition requiring that he should be put under some restraint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, etc. These scribes had apparently been sent down by the Sanhedrim, on purpose to watch him, and, by giving their own opinion upon his claims, to undermine his influence. They gave as their authoritative judgment, \"He hath Beelzebub.\" One of the most prominent characteristics of the public works of our Lord was the expulsion of evil spirits. There was no questioning the facts. Even modern scepticism is here at fault, and is constrained to admit the fact of sudden and complete cures of insanity. So the scribes were obliged to account for what they could not deny. \"He hath Beelzebub,\" they say; that is, he is possessed by Beelzebub, or \"the lord of the dwelling,\" as a source of supernatural power. They had heard it alleged against him,\" He hath a devil;\" and so they fall in with this popular error, and give it emphasis, by saying, Not only has he a devil, but he is possessed by the chief of the devils, and therefore has authority over inferior spirits. Observe the contrast between the thoughts of the multitude and of those who professed to be their teachers, the scribes and Pharisees. The multitude, free from prejudice, and using only their natural light of reason, candidly owned the greatness of Christ's miracles as wrought by a Divine power; whereas the Pharisees, filled with envy and malice, attributed these mighty works which he wrought by the finger of God, to the direct agency of Satan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-27. - How can Satan cast out Satan? Observe here that our Lord distinctly affirms the personality of Satan, and a real kingdom of evil. But then he goes on to show that if this their allegation were true, namely, that he cast out devils by the prince or the devils, then it would follow that Satan's kingdom would be divided against itself. As a house divided against itself cannot stand, so neither could the kingdom of Satan exist in the world if one evil spirit was opposed to another for the purpose of dispossessing, the one the other, from the minds and bodies of men. Our Lord thus employs another argument to show that he casts out evil spirits, not by Beelzebub, but by the power of God. It is as though he said, \"As he who invades the house of a strong man cannot succeed until he first binds the strong man; in like manner I, Christ Jesus, who spoil the kingdom of Satan, whilst I lead sinners who had been under his power to repentance and salvation, must first bind Satan himself, otherwise he would never suffer me to take his captives from him. Therefore he is my enemy, and not in league with me, not my ally in the casting out of evil spirits, as you falsely represent me to be. It behoves you, then, to understand that it is with the Spirit of God that I cast out devils, and that therefore the kingdom of God is come upon you.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, etc. St. Mark adds the words (ver. 30), \"Because they said, [ἔλεγον, 'they were saying,'] He hath an unclean spirit.\" This helps us much to the true meaning of this declaration. Our Lord does not here speak of every sin against the Holy Spirit, but of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. These words of St. Mark point to a sin of the tongue mere especially, although not excluding thoughts and deeds against the Holy Spirit. Observe what these scribes and Pharisees did; they cavilled at works manifestly Divine - works wrought by God for the salvation of men, by which he confirmed his faith and truth. Now, when they spake against these, and knowingly and of malice ascribed them to the evil spirit, then they blasphemed against the Holy Ghost, dishonoring God by assigning his power to Satan. What could be more hateful than this? What greater blasphemy could be imagined? And surely they must be guilty of this sin who ascribe the fruits and actions of the Holy Spirit to an impure and unholy source, and so strive to mar his work and to hinder his influence in the hearts of men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Hath never forgiveness. Not that any sinner need despair of forgiveness through the fear that he may have committed this sin; for his repentance shows that his state of mind has never been one of entire enmity, and that he has not so grieved the Holy Spirit as to have been entirely forsaken by him. But is in danger of eternal damnation. The Greek words, according to the most approved reading, are ἀλλ ἔνοχός ἐστιν αἰωνίου ἁμαρτήματος: but is guilty of an eternal sin; thus showing that there are sins of which the effects and the punishment belong to eternity. He is bound by a chain or' sin from which he can never be loosed. (See St. John 9:41, \"Therefore your sin remaineth.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they said, He hath an unclean spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-33. - Our Lord's brethren and his mother had now arrived (see ver. 21) to look after him. He was in the house teaching; but the crowd was so great that they could not approach him. The multitude filled not only the room, but the courtyard and all the approaches. St. Luke (Lujke 8:19) says,\" they could not come at him for the crowd.\" His brethren here spoken of were in all probability his cousins, the sons of Mary, the wife of Alphaeus or Clopas. But two of these, already chosen to be apostles, were most likely with him in the room, and of the number of those towards whom he stretched out his hand and said, \"Behold, my mother and my brethren!\" whilst Mary and the others had come (Mary, perhaps, induced by the others in the hope that the sight of his mother might the more move him) for the purpose of bringing him back to the quiet of Nazareth. We cannot suppose that the Virgin Mary came with any other feeling than that of a mother's anxiety in behalf of her Son. She may have thought that he was in danger, exposed to the fickle temper of a large multitude, who might at any moment have their passions stirred against him by his enemies, the scribes and Pharisees; and so she was willingly persuaded to come and use her influence with him to induce him to escape from what appeared evidently to be a position of some danger. If so, this explains our Lord's behavior on this occasion. The multitude was sitting about him, and he was teaching them; and then a message was brought to him from his mother and his brethren who were without, perhaps in the courtyard, perhaps beyond in the open street, calling for him. The interruption was untimely, not to say unseemly. And so he says, not without a little tone of severity in his words, Who is my mother and my brethren? Our Lord did not speak thus as denying his human relationship; as though he was not \"very man,\" but a mere \"phantom,\" as some early heretics taught; and still less as though he was ashamed of his earthly lationships; but partly perhaps because the messengers too boldly and inconsiderately interrupted him while he was teaching; and chiefly that he might show that his heavenly Father's business was more to him than the affection of his earthly mother, greatly as he valued it; and thus he preferred the spiritual relationship, in which there is neither male nor female, bond nor free, but all stand alike to Christ in the relationship of brother, sister, and mother. It is remarkable, and yet the reason for the omission is obvious, that our Lord does not mention\" father\" in this spiritual category.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Looking round on them περιβλεψάμενος <ΒΤΤ·Ξομμενταρψ Ωορδ>which sat round about him. Here is one of the graphic touches of St. Mark, reproduced, it may be, from St. Peter. Our Lord's intellectual and loving eye swept the inner circle of his disciples. The twelve, of course, would be with him, and others with them. His enemies were not far off. But immediately about him were those who constituted his chosen ones. As man, he had his human affections and his earthly relationships; but as the Son of God, he knew no other relatives but God's children, to whom the performance of his will and the promotion of his glory are the first of all duties and the dominant principle of their lives.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark3:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Mark.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And again he began to teach by the seaside. This return to the seaside is mentioned by St. Mark only. From this time our Lord's teaching began to be more public. The room and the little courtyard no longer sufficed for the multitudes that came to him. The Authorized Version says that \"a great multitude was gathered unto him.\" The Greek adjective, according to the most approved reading, is πλεῖστος the superlative of πολὺς, and should be rendered \"a very great\" multitude. They bad probably been waiting for him in the neighborhood of Capernaum. He entered into a boat - probably the boat mentioned at Mark 3:9 - and sat in the sea, i.e. in the boat afloat on the water, so as to be relieved of the pressure of the vast multitude (πλεῖστος ὄχλος) gathered on the shore.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He taught them many things in parables. This was a new system of teaching. For some months he had taught directly. But as he found that this direct teaching was met in some quarters with unbelief and scorn, he abandoned it for the less direct method of the parable. The parable (παραβολή) is etymologically the setting forth of one thing by the side of another, so that the one may be compared with the other. The parable is the truth presented by a similitude. It differs from the proverb inasmuch as it is necessarily figurative. The proverb may be figurative, but it need not of necessity be figurative. The parable is often an expanded proverb, and the proverb a condensed parable. There is but one Hebrew word for the two English words \"parable\" and \"proverb,\" which may account for their being frequently interchanged. The proverb (Latin) is a common sentiment generally accepted. The parable (Greek) is something put by the side of something else. Theologically, it is something in the world of nature which finds its counterpart in the world of spirit. The parable attracts attention, and so becomes valuable as a test of character. It reveals the seekers after truth, those who love the light. It withdraws the light from those who love darkness. And said unto them in his doctrine (ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ αὐτοῦ); literally, in his teaching, namely, that particular mode of teaching which he bad just introduced; \"he taught them\" (ἐδίδασκεν).

This word is introduced in St. Mark's narrative only; and it is very suitable to the warning at ver. 9, \"he hath ears to hear, let him hear. The sower went forth to sow. The scope of this beautiful parable is this: Christ teaches us that he is the Sower, that is, the great Preacher of the gospel among men.NEWLINENEWLINE1. But not all who hear the gospel believe it and receive it; just as some of the seed sown fell by the wayside, on the hard footpath, where it could not penetrate the ground, but lay upon the surface, and so was picked up by the birds.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Again, not all who hear and believe persevere in the faith; some fall away; like the seed sown on rocky ground, which springs up indeed, but for want of depth of soil puts forth no root, and is soon scorched by the rising sun, and, being without root, withers away.NEWLINENEWLINE3. But further, not all who show faith bring forth the fruit of good works; like the seed sown among the thorns, which, growing up together with it, choked it (συνέπνιξαν αὐτὸ); such is the meaning. St. Luke has the words (συμφυεῖσαι αἱ ἄκανθαι ἀπέπνιξαν), \"the thorns grew up with it and choked it.\"NEWLINENEWLINE4. But, lastly, there are those who receive the gospel in the love of it, and bring forth fruit, not, however, in equal measures, but some thirtyfold, some sixty, some a hundred; and this on account of the greater influences of grace, or on account of the more ready co-operation of the free-will of man with the sovereign grace of God. The whole parable marks a gradation. In the first case the seed produces nothing; in the second it produces only the blade; in the third it is near the point of producing fruit, but fails to bring forth to perfection; in the fourth it yields fruit, but in different measures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. St. Luke (Luke 8:8) bus a stronger word than (ἔλεγεν) \"he said.\" He (Luke 8:8) has (ἐφώνει) \"he cried.\" Our Lord uses this expression, \"he that hath ears to hear,\" etc, when the subject-matter is figurative or obscure, as though to rouse the attention of his hearers. He has \"ears to hear\" who diligently attends to the words of Christ, that he may ponder and obey them. Many heard him out of curiosity, that they might bear something new, or learned, or brilliant; not that they might lay to heart the things which they heard, and endeavor to practice them in their lives. And so it is with those who go to hear sermons on account of the fame of the preacher, and not that they may learn to amend their lives; and thus the words of Jehovah to Ezekiel (Ezekiel 33:32) are fulfilled, \"And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When he was alone. These words do not appear in St. Matthew's account. He simply says that \" the disciples came and said unto him.\" This must have been upon some other occasion. It could not have been when be was preaching from the boat; for St. Mark says, they that were about him with the twelve. He is the only evangelist who notices this. We must not forget that, besides the twelve, there were seventy other disciples. They asked of him the parables (τὰς παραβολάς), according to the best reading. The inquiry was a general one, although St. Mark here gives the explanation of one only.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - To know the mystery. The Greek verb γνῶναι, to know, is not found in the best manuscripts, in which the words are (ὑμῖν τὸ μυστὴριον δέδοται), unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God. Our Lord here explains why he spake to the mixed multitude in parables; namely, because most of them were as yet incapable of receiving the gospel: some would not believe it, others reviled it. Therefore our Lord here encourages his own disciples to search out his words spoken in parables, and humbly to inquire into their full meaning, that so they might become able ministers and efficient preachers of the gospel. Moreover, by this he shows that this efficiency cannot be obtained by our own strength, but must be humbly sought for from God. For it is his own gift which he bestows on the disciples of Christ, and denies to others, whom he leaves to the blindness of their own hearts. It is as though he said, \"To you, my disciples, my apostles, it is given, since you believe in me as the Messiah, to have continually more clear revelations from me of the mysteries of God and of heaven, by which you shall day by day increase in the knowledge and love of him. But from the scribes and others, because they will not believe in me as their own Messiah, God will take away even that small knowledge which they have of him and of his kingdom. Yea, he will deprive them of all the special privileges which they have hitherto possessed.\" But the words are not limited in their application to those who were living on the earth when Christ sojourned here. He says to all in every age who come within the reach of his gospel, \"Those who come to me with a sincere heart and a simple desire to know the truth, as you, my apostles, are doing, to them I will reveal the mysteries of my kingdom, and I will help them onwards in the path of holiness, by which they may at length attain to the heavenly kingdom. But they who have not this pure desire of truth, but indulge their own lusts and errors, from them that little knowledge of God and of Divine things will by degrees be taken away, and they will become altogether blind.\" Observe the expression (ἐκείνοις δὲ τοῖς ἔξω), but unto them that are without. There were then, just as there are now, those who were outside the realm of spiritual things; not caring for, not understanding, not desirous of spiritual truth. Lest at any time they should be converted (μήποτε ἐπιστρέψωσι) - lest haply they should turn again (the verb is active) and their sins should be forgiven them. According to the best reading, τὰ ἁμαρτήματα is omitted; so it runs, and it should be forgiven them. The use of the active verb brings out the sinner's responsibility with respect to his own conversion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables? that is, \"How, then, can you expect to understand all parables, as they ought to do who are instructed unto the kingdom of heaven?\" It is St. Mark alone who recalls and records these words. They are striking and vivid, as illustrating the condition of mind of the disciples at this time - slow of apprehension, and yet desirous to learn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sower soweth the word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. -The sower soweth the word. St. Matthew (Matthew 13:19) calls it \"the word of the kingdom\" - an expression equivalent to \"the gospel of the kingdom,\" not merely moral truth, but spiritual and eternal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Straightway cometh Satan. St. Matthew (Matthew 13:19) says, \"then cometh (ὁ πονηρὸς) the evil one;\" the same expression which our Lord uses in the Lord's Prayer, and which helps to justify the English rendering in the Revised Version there. As the seed failing by the wayside is refused by the hard and well-trodden ground, and so is readily picked up by the birds; in like manner, the seed of God's Word, falling upon a heart rendered callous by the custom of sinning, is straightway snatched away by \"the evil one,\" urging the heart again to its accustomed sins. Well may we pray to be delivered from this \"evil one.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground. This sentence would be better rendered, And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky places, where the words \"likewise,\" or \"in like manner,\" mean \"by a similar mode of interpretation.\" This is the second condition of soil on which the seed is sown - a better condition than the former; for the former plainly refused the seed, but this, having some soil layout. able to the germination of the seed, receives it, and the seed springs up, though but for a little while. So the rocky ground is like the heart of that hearer who hears the Word of God, and receives it with joy. He is delighted with its beauty, its justice, its purity; and he breaks forth with holy affections. But alas he has more of the rock than of the good soil in his heart. Hence the Word of God cannot strike a deep root into his soul. He is not constant in the faith. He endures but for a time, and in the hour of temptation he falls away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And these are they which are sown among thorns. According to the best authorities, the words are (καὶ ἄλλοι εἰσιν), and others are they, etc. This marks a considerable difference between the two classes. This is the third condition of soft; and it is so much better than the former, inasmuch as the thorns present less obstacles to the growth of the seed than the rocky ground does. This similitude indicates the heart of that hearer who is beset with the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The cares of the world (τοῦ αἰῶνος); literally, of the age; that is, temporal and secular cares, incident to the age in which our lot is cast, and which are common to all. These, like thorns, distress and trouble, and often wound the soul; while, on the other hand, the care of the soul and the thought of heavenly things compose and establish the mind. The deceitfulness of riches. Riches are aptly compared to thorns, because, like thorns, they pierce the soul. St. Paul (1 Timothy 6:10) speaks of some who, through the love of riches, \"have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\" Riches are deceitful, because they often seduce the soul from God and from salvation, and are the cause of many sins. \"How hardly,\" says our Lord, \"shall a rich man enter into the kingdom of God I\" They have a tendency to choke the Word of God, and to weaken the power of religion. \"Those are the only true riches,\" says St. Gregory, \"which make us rich in virtue.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Those are they that were sown upon the good ground. The good ground represents the heart which receives the Word of God with joy and desire, and true devotion of spirit, and which steadfastly retains it, whether in prosperity or in adversity; and so yields fruit, \"sows thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold.\" St. Jerome remarks that, as of the bad ground there were three different kinds - the way, side, the rocky, and the thorny ground; so of the good ground there is a threefold gradation indicated in the amount of its productiveness. There are differences of conditions in the hearts both of those who believe and of these who do not believe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, etc.? The Greek is ὁ λύχνος, and is better rendered the lamp. The figure is recorded by St. Matthew (Matthew 5:15) as used by our Lord in his sermon on the mount. It is evident that he repeated his sayings, and used them sometimes in a different connection. The lamp is here the light of Divine truth, shining in the person of Christ. Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel? It comes to us. The light in our souls is not of our own kindling; it comes to us from God, that we may manifest it for his glory. \"The bushel\" (μόδιος), from the Latin medias, a measure containing flour, was the flour-bin, a part of the furniture of every house, as was the tall lampstand with its single light. St, Luke (Luke 8:16) calls it \"a vessel\" (καλύπτει αὐτὸν σκεύει). The light is to be set on \"a lamp-stand,\" and in like manner the light which we have received is to shine before men. As Christians, we are Christ's light-bearers. By this illustration our Lord teaches that he was unwilling that the mysteries of this great parable of the sower and of other parables should be concealed, but that his disciples should unfold these things to others as he had to them, although at present they might not be able to receive them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested. The Greek of the latter part of this sentence, according to the best authorities, runs thus: ἐὰν μὴ ἵνα φανερωθῇ; so the true rendering of the words is, there is nothing hid save that it should be manifested; that is, there is nothing now hid, but in order that it may be made known. There is a great principle of the Divine operations here announced by our Lord. Much, very much, is now hidden from us, in nature, in providence, and in grace. But it will not always be hidden. In natural things more and more is revealed as science advances, and in providence and in grace the mysteries of the kingdom will one day, and at the fitting time, be laid open to all. \"What I tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light\" (Matthew 10:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man have ears to hear, let him hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Take heed what ye hear. Attend, that is, to these words which ye hear from me, that ye may understand them, and commit them to memory, and so be able to communicate them effectually to others. Let none of my words escape you. Our Lord bids us to pay the greatest attention to his words, and so to digest them that we may be able to teach them to others. With what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you: and more shall be given unto you. Our Lord's meaning is clearly this: If you freely and plentifully communicate and preach my doctrine to others, you shall receive a corresponding reward. Nay, you shall have a return in far more abundant measure. For thus the fountains, the more water they pour out below, so much the more do they receive from above. Here, then, is great encouragement to all faithful teachers of the Word, of whatever kind; that by how much they give to others in teaching them, by so much the more shall they receive of wisdom and grace from Christ; according to those words of the apostle, \"He that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully\" (2 Corinthians 9:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For he that hath, to him shall be given. He that uses his gifts, whether of intellect or of goodness, bestowed upon him by God, to him shall be granted an increase of those gifts. But from him who uses them not, God will gradually take them away. Christ here encourages his apostles and disciples to diligent and earnest preaching of his gospel, by promising them in return yet greater influxes of his wisdom and grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-28. - This parable is recorded by St. Mark alone. It differs greatly from the parable of the sower, although both of them are founded upon the imagery of the seed cast into the ground. In both cases the seed represents the doctrine of the gospel; the field represents the hearers; the harvest the end of the world, or perhaps the death of each individual hearer. So is the kingdom of God, in its progress from its establishment to its completion. The sower casts seed upon the earth, not without careful preparation of the soil, but without further sowing. And then he pursues his ordinary business. He sleeps by night; he rises by day; he has leisure for other employment; his work as a sower is finished. Meanwhile the seed germinates and grows by its own hidden virtues, assisted by the earth, the sun, and the air, the sower knowing nothing of the mysterious process. First comes the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. Such is the preaching of the gospel. Here, therefore, the sower represents human responsibility in the work. The vitality of the seed is independent of his labour. The earth develops the plant from the seed by those natural but mysterious processes through which the Creator is ever working. So in spiritual things, the sower commences the work, and the grace of God perfects it in the heart which receives these influences. The earth beareth fruit of herself. In like manner, by degrees, the faith of Christ increases through the preaching of the gospel; and the Church grows and expands. And what is true of the Church collectively is true also of each individual member of the Church. For the heart of each faithful Christian produces first the blade, when it conceives good desires and begins to put them into action; then the ear, when it brings them to good effect; and lastly the full corn in the ear, when it brings them to their full maturity and perfection. Hence our Lord in this parable intimates that they who labour for the conversion of souls ought, with much patience, to wait for the fruit of 'their labour, as the husbandman waits with much patience for the precious fruits of the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - But when the fruit is ripe (ὅταν δὲ παραδῷ ὁ καρπὸς). The verb here is active; it might be rendered delivereth up, or alloweth. It is a peculiar expression, though evidently meaning \"when the fruit is ready.\" He putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come. As soon as Christ's work is completed, whether in the Church or in the individual, \"immediately\" the sickle is sent forth. As soon as a Christian is ready for heaven, God calls him away; and therefore we may infer that it is unwise, if not sinful, for a Christian, pressed it may be with sickness or trouble, to be eager in wishing to leave this world. \"It is one thing to be willing to go when God pleases; it is another thing to speak as though we wished to hasten our departure.\" \"When the fruit is ripe, immediately he putteth forth the sickle.\" If therefore, the sickle is not yet sent forth, it is because the fruit is not yet fully ripe. The afflictions of the faithful are God's means to ripen them for heaven. They are the dressing which the Lord of the vineyard employs to make the tree more fruitful, to make the Christian more fruitful in grace, and more ripe for glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-32. - Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it! In the first clause of this verse the best authorities give πῶς for τίνι, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? and in the second clause, instead of the Greek of which the Authorized Version is the rendering, the best-approved reading is (τίνι αὐτὴν παραβολῇ θῶμεν), in what parable shall we set it forth? Our Lord thus stimulates the intellect of his hearers, by making them his associates, as it were, in the search for appropriate similitudes (see Dr. Morison, in loc.). The kingdom of God, that is, his Church on earth, is like a grain of mustard seed. By this image our Lord shows the great power, fertility, and extension of the Church; inasmuch as it started from a very small and apparently insignificant beginning, and spread itself over the whole world. It is not literally and absolutely true that the grain of mustard seed is less than all seeds. There are other seeds which are less than it. But the expression may readily be allowed when we compare the smallness of the seed with the greatness of the results produced by it. It is one of the least of all seeds. And so the preaching of the Gospel and the establishment of the Church was one of the smallest of beginnings. Perhaps the well-known pungency of the seed of the mustard plant may suggest the quickening, stimulating power of the Gospel when it takes root in the heart. The mustard plant shoots out large branches, which are used as fuel in some countries, quite large enough for shadow for the birds. A traveler in South America says that it grows to so large a tree upon the slopes of the mountains of Chili that he could ride under its branches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33, 34. - With many such parables; such, that is, as he had just been delivering - plain and simple illustrations which all might understand; not abstruse and difficult similitudes, but sufficiently plain for them to perceive that there was heavenly and Divine truth lying hidden beneath them, so that they might be drawn onwards through that which they did understand, to search into something hidden beneath it, which at present they did not know. But privately to his own disciples he expounded (ἐπέλυε) all things. This word (ἐπιλύω) occurs nowhere else in the Gospels. But it does occur in St. Peter's second Epistle (2 Peter 1:20), \"No Scripture is of any private (ἐπιλύσεως) exposition, or interpretation.\" This suggests a connection between St. Mark's Gospel and that Epistle, and may be accepted as an auxiliary evidence, however small, as to the genuineness of the Epistle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35, 36. - And on that day, - the day, that is, on which the parables were delivered, at least those recorded by St. Mark - when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side. And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. It was the boat from which he had been preaching. They made no special preparation. They did not land first to obtain provisions. It would have been inconvenient to go ashore in the midst of the crowd. They made at once, as he told them to do, for the other side. And other boats were with him. This is another interesting circumstance. Probably those who were in these boats had availed themselves of them to get nearer to the great Prophet, the boatmen themselves having seen the vast crowd that was gathered on the shore, and so having been attracted thither. Thus he had a large audience on the sea as well as on the land. And not it was so ordered that he was surrounded by a fleet and by a multitude of witnesses when he stilled the tempest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - And there arose a great storm of wind; literally, there ariseth (γίνεται λαίλαψ). St. Mark often uses the historical present, which gives vigor and point to his narrative. And the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling (ἤδη γεμίζεσθαι). St. Matthew says (Matthew 8:24), \"the boat was covered with the waves.\" St. Luke (Luke 8:23), \"they were filling with water, and were in jeopardy.\" Bede and ethers have thought that the boat in which Christ was the only boat that was tossed by this storm; in order that Christ might show his power in limiting the area of the tempest. But it is far more probable that the ether boats were subject to it; for they were very near to the boat in which Christ was. There must have been some reason for the allusion to these boats; and the wider the reach of the tempest, the greater would appear the Divine power of Christ in stilling it, and the greater the amount of testimony to the reality of the miracle. The miracle was wrought to show his power over all creation, the sea as well as the dry land; and that they, his disciples, and all who were with him might believe in him as the Omnipotent God. But further, this tempest on the sea of Galilee was a type and symbol of the trials and temptations which should come on the Church. For the Church of God is as a ship in a storm, ever tossed upon \"the waves of this troublesome world.\" And then, moreover, as the rude storm urges the ship onwards, so that it more quickly reaches the desired haven, so afflictions and temptations quicken Christ's disciples to the greater desire of holiness, by which they are borne onwards more speedily to \"the haven where they would be.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow; more literally, he himself was in the stern (η΅ν αὐτὸς ἐπὶ τῇ πρύμνῃ) asleep on the cushion (ἐπὶ τὸ προσκεφάλαιον καθεύδων). He had changed his posture. He was weary with the labour of addressing the great multitude. He had sought the momentary rest which the crossing of the lake offered to him. He was resting his head upon the low bench which served both for a seat and for a pillow. But while he slept as man, he was watchful as God. \"Behold, he that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps.\" Master, carest thou not that we perish? This question savours of impatience, if not of irreverence. Who so likely to have put it as St. Peter? Nor would he be likely afterwards to forget that he had put it. Hence, probably, its appearance in St. Mark's Gospel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - And he arose - literally, he awoke (διεγερθεὶς) - and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still (Σιώπα πεφίμωσο); literally, Be silent! be muzzled! The Greek perfect implies that before the word was uttered, the thing was done by the simple fiat of his will preceding the word. The combined descriptions of the synoptists show that the storm was very violent, such as no human power could have composed or stilled. So that these words indicate the supreme authority of Christ as God, ruling the sea with his mighty power. Thus Christ shows himself to be God. In like manner, Christ is able to overrule and control the persecutions of the Church and the temptations of the soul. St. Augustine says that \"when we allow temptations to overcome us, Christ sleeps in us. We forget Christ at such times. Let us, then, remember him. Let us awake him. He will speak. He will rebuke the tempest in the soul, and there will be a great calm.\" There was a great calm. For all creation perceives its Creator. He never speaks in vain. It is observable that, as in his miracles of healing, the subjects of them usually passed at once to perfect soundness, so here, there was no gradual subsiding of the storm, as in the ordinary operations of nature, but almost before the word had escaped his lips there was a perfect calm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful! have ye not yet faith? Not πῶς οὐκ ἔχετε, but οὔπω ἔχετε. If they had faith, they would have known that, though asleep, he could preserve them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark4:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? This would seem to have been said by the sailors, though it was doubtless assented to by all.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And they came to the other side of the sea. The other side of the sea would be the south-east side of the sea. Into the country of the Gadarenes, or rather, Gera-senes, which is now generally admitted to be the true reading, from Gerasa, Gersa, or Kersa. There was another Gerasa, situated at some distance from the sea, on the borders of Arabia Petraea. The ruins of the Gerasa, here referred to, have been recently discovered by Dr. Thomson, ('The Land and the Book'). Immediately over this spot is a lofty mountain, in which are ancient tombs; and from this mountain there is an almost perpendicular declivity, literally (κρημνός) corresponding accurately to what is required by the description in the narrative of the miracle. Dr. Farrar ('Life of Christ') says that in the days of Eusebius and Jerome, tradition pointed to a \"steep place\" near \"Gerasa\" as the scene of the miracle. The foot of this steep is washed by the waters of the lake, which are at once very deep.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-5. - There met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. St. Matthew says that there were two. St. Luke, like St. Mark, mentions only one, and him \"possessed with devils,\" The one mentioned by St. Mark was no doubt the more prominent and fierce of the two. This does not mean merely a person with a disordered intellect. No doubt, in this case, as in that of insanity, physical causes may have helped to lay the victim open to such an incursion; and this may account for cases of possession being enumerated with various sicknesses, though distinguished from them. But our Lord evidently deals with these persons, not as persons suffering from insanity, but as the subjects of an alien spiritual power, external to themselves. He addresses the unclean spirit through the man that was possessed, and says,\" Come forth thou unclean spirit\" (Ver. 8). There met him out of the tombs. The Jews did not have their burial-places in their cities, lest they should be defiled; therefore they buried their dead without the gates in the fields or mountains. Their sepulchres were frequently hewn out of the rock in the sides of the limestone hills, and they were lofty and capacious; so that the living could enter them, as into a vault. So this demoniac dwelt in the tombs, because the unclean spirit drove him thither, where the associations of the place would accord with his malady and aggravate its symptoms. St. Matthew, speaking of the two, says that they were \"exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass that way.\" The demoniac particularly mentioned by St. Mark is described as having been possessed of that extraordinary muscular strength which maniacs so often put forth; so that all efforts to bind and restrain him had proved ineffectual. No man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain (οὐδὲ ἁλύσειύ). Chains and fetters had often been tried, but in vain. Frequently too, in the paroxysms of his malady, he would turn his violence against himself, crying out, and cutting himself with stones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And when he saw Jesus from afar. These words, \"from afar,\" explain the fact of our Lord being immediately met by the man as soon as he left the boat. Vers. 3-5 inclusive must be regarded as parenthetical. They describe the ordinary condition of the demoniac, and his sad wild life from day to day. From the high ground which he frequented he had seen the boat, in which Jesus was, nearing the shore. He had seen the other boats. Perhaps he had seen the sudden rise of the storm and its equally sudden suppression; and he, like others who witnessed it, was affected by it. So he hastened to the shore; he ran and worshipped him. He felt the power of his presence, and so he was constrained through fear to do him reverence, for \"the devils also believe and shudder (φρίσσουσι)\" (James 2:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He cried with a loud voice; that is, the evil spirit cried out, using the organs of the man whom he possessed. What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the Most High God? From hence it appears that, although at the great temptation of our Lord in the wilderness, Satan had but an imperfect knowledge of him: yet now, after the evidence of these great miracles, and more especially of his power over the evil spirits, there was a general belief amongst the hosts of evil that he was indeed the Son of God, the Messiah. I adjure thee by God, torment me not. The torment which he dreaded was that which he might suffer after expulsion. So St. Luke says that they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss. Great as this mystery of evil is, we may believe that the evil spirits, although while they roam about upon this earth they are in misery, still it is some alleviation that they are not yet shut up in the prison-house of hell, but are suffered to wander about and their depraved pleasure in tempting men; so that, if possible, they may at last drag them down with them into the abyss. For they are full of hatred of God and envy of man; and they find a miserable satisfaction in endeavoring to keep men out of those heavenly mansions from which, through pride, they are themselves now for ever excluded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man; literally, for he was saying (ἔλεγε). The unclean spirit endeavored to arrest, before it was spoken, that word of power which he knew he must obey. So in what follows, He was asking him (ἐπηρώτα), What is thy name? Why does our Lord ask this question? Clearly to elicit from him an answer that would reveal the multitude of the evil spirits, and so make his own power over them to be fully known. And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many. The Roman legion consisted of six thousand soldiers. But the word is here used indefinitely for a large number. St. Luke so explains it where he says (Luke 8:30), \"And he said, Legion: for many devils were entered into him.\" This revelation is doubtless designed to teach us how great is the number as well as the malignity of the evil spirits. If one human being can be possessed by so many, how vast must be the host of those who are permitted to have access to the souls of men, and if possible lead them to destruction! Satan here imitates him who is \"The Lord of hosts.\" He too marshals his hosts, that he may fight against God and his people. But \"for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. It would appear as though this evil spirit felt (speaking in the name of the other evil spirits) that if they were driven out from their present dwelling-places, their condition would be changed for the worse; and that until the time should come when they were to be cast into the abyss, their best relief was to possess some materialism, to occupy flesh and blood, and that flesh and blood tenanted by a spiritual being, through whom they might torment others. They could find no rest, no relief, but in this. \"The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not\" (Matthew 12:43). Even the swine were better than nothing; but that dwelling did not serve the evil spirits long.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now there was there nigh unto the mountains - literally, on the mountain side (πρὸς τὰ ὅρη) - a great herd of swine feeding. St. Matthew says (Matthew 8:30), \"There was a good way off from them:\" our Lord's interview with the demoniac was on the seashore. \"The herd of swine,\" two thousand in number (as St. Mark tells us, with his usual attention to details), were at a distance, feeding on the slopes of the mountain; The Jews were not allowed to eat swine's flesh. But Jews were not the only inhabitants of that district. It had been colonized, at least in part, by the Romans immediately after the conquest of Syria, some sixty years before Christ. It was in this district that ten cities are said to have been rebuilt by the Romans, whence the territory acquired the name of \"the Decapolis.\" And though the Jews were forbidden their Law to eat this kind of food, yet they were not forbidden to breed swine for other uses, such as provisioning the Roman army.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And he gave them leave. They could not enter even into the swine without Christ's permission; how much less into \"the sheep of his pasture\"!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place (κατὰ τοῦ κρημνοῦ) - literally, down the steep - into the sea,... and were choked in the sea. By this Christ shows of how little worth are earthly possessions when set in the balance with the souls of men. The recovery of this demoniac was worth far more than the value of the two thousand swine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And they that fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. St. Matthew mentions only the city. St. Mark's narrative is more full. No doubt many of these swineherds lived in the country districts; and so the fame of the miracle was spread far and wide. The swineherds would take care that the owners should understand that it was through no fault or carelessness on their part that the swine had perished; but that the destruction was caused by a power over which they had no control. And they - i.e. the owners - came to see what it was that had come to pass. Their first care was to see the extent of their loss; and this was soon revealed to them. They must have seen the carcases of the swine floating hither and thither in the now calm and tranquil sea; and when they had thus satisfied themselves as to the facts, \"they came to Jesus.\" St. Mark here uses the historic present, \"they come to Jesus,\" that they might behold him of whom these great things were told, as well as the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone when they entered into the swine. They were, of course, concerned to know the magnitude of their loss, and the mode in which it had happened, that they might see whether there were any means by which it might be made up to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And they come to Jesus, and behold him that was possessed with devils sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him that had the legion; and they were afraid. St, Luke adds that they found him sitting at the feet of Jesus. It is likely enough that the man, as soon as he found himself dispossessed, had east himself at the feet of Jesus, and was worshipping him; but that, when hidden by Christ to sit, he chose to place himself at his feet. \"He was clothed, and in his right mind.\" What a contrast to the previous description! \"And they were afraid.\" They dreaded Christ's power. They saw that he was almighty; but they did not seek to know his love, and so to attain to that love which \"casteth out fear.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - How it befell him that was pessessed with devils, and concerning the swine. The loss of the swine. They could not get over that. They thought far more of the worldly loss than of the spiritual gain; and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders. St. Luke (Luke 8:37) says that \"they were taken (συνείχοντο) [literally, were holden] with great fear.\" This was the dominant feeling. They did not entreat him to depart out of humility, as though they felt themselves unworthy of his presence; but out of servile, slavish fear, lest his continued presence among them might bring upon them still greater losses. They saw that Jesus, a Jew according to the flesh, was holy, powerful, Divine. But they knew that they were Gentiles, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Wherefore they feared lest he should punish them more grievously, both on account of their being Gentiles and on account of their past sins. It was not, therefore, so much on account of hatred, as out of a timorous fear, that they besought Jesus that he would depart out of their borders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - And as he was entering into the boat, he that had been possessed with devils besought him that he might he with him. It was natural that he should desire this. It would be grateful and soothing to him to be near to Christ, from whom he had received so great a benefit and yet hoped for more. And he suffered him not, but saith unto him; Go to thy house unto thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee. Our Lord here takes a different course from what lie so often took. He saw, no doubt, that this restored demoniac was fitted for missionary work; and there was no reason to apprehend any inconvenience to himself in consequence from a people who wished to get rid of him. And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis - in Decapolis, i.e. through the whole district of the ten cities - how great things Jesus had done for him. This would bring him into contact alike with Gentiles and with Jews; and so this dispossessed demoniac became a missionary to both Jew and Gentile. Here he planted the standard of the cross.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Jesus now crosses over the sea again, and apparently in the same boat, to the other side, the opposite shore, near to Capernaum. St. Matthew (Matthew 4:13) distinctly tells us that he had left Nazareth, and was now dwelling at Capernaum, thus fulfilling the ancient prophecy with regard to Zebulun and Nephthalim. The circumstances under which he quitted Nazareth are given by St. Luke (Luke 4:16-31). St. Matthew (Matthew 9:1) calls Capernaum his own city. Thus as Christ ennobled Bethlehem by his birth, Nazareth by his education, and Jerusalem By his death, so he honored Capernaum by making it his ordinary residence, and the focus, so to speak, of his preaching and miracles. When Jesus returned, a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea. St. Luke says that the people welcomed him, for they were waiting for him. Again he placed himself by the sea, probably for the conveniences of addressing a multitude, and of relieving himself of the pressure, as before, by taking refuge in a boat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - One of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name. He appears to have been one of the \"college of elders,\" who administered the affairs of the synagogue. The name Jairus, or \"Ya eiros,\" is probably the Greek form of the Hebrew Jair, \"he will illuminate.\" He fell at his feet, and besought him greatly; it is literally (πίπτει καὶ παρεκάλει), he falleth at his feet, and beseecheth him. We picture him to ourselves, making his way through the crowd, and as he approached Jesus, kneeling down, and then bending his head towards him, until his forehead touched the ground. My little daughter is at the point of death. St. Matthew says, \"is even now dead;\" St. Luke says, \"she Jay a dying.\" The broken sentences of the father are very true to nature. All the expressions point to the same conclusion, that she was in articulo mortis. In each narrative the ruler is represented as asking that Christ would hasten to his house. He had not reached the higher faith of the Gentile centurion, \"Speak the word only.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And he went (καὶ ἀπῆλθε μετ αὐτοῦ) - literally, and he went away with him - and a great multitude followed him, they thronged him (συνέθλιβον αὐτόν); literally, pressed close upon him, compressed him. This is mentioned purposely by St. Mark, on account of what follows. St. Matthew says (Matthew 9:19), \"And Jesus arose, and so did his disciples.\" Observe here the promptitude of Christ to assist the afflicted. St. Chrysostom suggests that our Lord purposely interposed some delay, by healing, as he went, the woman with the issue of blood, in order that the actual death of the daughter of Jairus might take place; and that so there might be full demonstration of his resurrection power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - A woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years. All the synoptic Gospels mention the length of time during which she had been suffering. Eusebius records a tradition that she was a Gentile, a native of Caesarea Philippi. This disease was a chronic hoemorrhage, for which she had found no relief from the physicians. Lightfoot, in his 'Horae Hebraicae,' gives a list of the remedies applied in such cases, which seem quite sufficient to account for St. Mark's statement that she was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse. St. Luke, himself a physician, says that she \"had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed of any.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - This woman, having heard of Jesus - literally (τὰ περί τοῦ Ἰησοῦ), the things concerning Jesus - came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment. St. Matthew and St Luke say \"the border (τοῦ κρασπέδου) of his garment.\" St. Matthew tells us that \"she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.\" From this it appears that, though she had faith, it was an imperfect faith. She seems to have imagined that a certain magical influence was within Christ and around him. And the touching of the border of his garment (the blue fringe which the Jews were required to wear, to remind them that they were God's people) was supposed by her to convey a special virtue. Yet her faith, though imperfect, was true in its essence, and therefore was not disappointed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And straightway - St. Mark's favourite word - the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt (ἔγνω) - literally, she knew - in her body that she was healed of her plague (ὅτι ἴαται ἀπὸ τῆς μάστιγος); literally, that she hath been healed of her scourge, The cure was instantaneous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The words in the Greek are ἐπιγνοὺς ἐν ἑαυτῷ τὴν ἐξ αὑτοῦ δύναμιν ἐξελθοῦσαν: Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power emanating from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments? Christ sees the invisible grace in its hidden operations; man only sees its effects, and not always these.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - St. Luke (Luke 8:45) adds here, \"When all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush thee. But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.\" This incident shows the mysterious connection between the spiritual and the physical. The miraculous virtue or power which went forth from the Saviour was spiritual in its source and in the conditions on which it was imparted, but it was physical in its operation; and that which brought the two together was faith. Multitudes thronged the Saviour, but only one of the crowd touched him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - He looked round about (περιεβλέπετο) - another favourite word of St. Mark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The woman fearing and trembling, etc. Every word in this verse is expressive. It was her own act. She seemed to herself as though without permission she had stolen a blessing from Christ; and so she could hardly venture to hope that the faith which had prompted her would be accepted. Hence her fear and terror, and her free and full confession. We thus see the gentleness of Christ in his dealings with us. Perhaps the woman had intended to escape, satisfied with a temporal benefit, which would hardly have been a blessing at all, if she had been suffered to carry it away without acknowledgment. But this her loving Saviour would not permit her to do. It was the crisis of her spiritual life. It was necessary that all around should know of the gift which she had endeavored to snatch in secret. Our Lord might have demanded from her this public confession of her faith beforehand. But, in his mercy, he made the way easy to her. The lesson, however, must not be forgotten, that it is not enough to believe with the heart. The lips must do their part, and \"with the mouth confession must be made unto salvation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Our Lord here reassures this trembling woman, who feared, it may be, lest, because she had abstracted the blessing secretly, he might punish her with a return of her malady. On the contrary, he confirms the benefit, and bids her be whole of her plague. The Greek expression here is stronger than that which is given as the rendering of what she had used when we read that she said within herself, \"I shall be saved (σωθήσομαι).\" Here our Lord says, Go in peace, and be whole (ἴσθι ὑγιὴς). It is as though he said, \"It is not the mere fringe of my garment, which you have touched with great faith, and with some hope of obtaining a cure - it is not this that has cured you. You owe your healing to my omnipotence and your faith. Your faith (itself my gift) has delivered you from your issue of blood; and this deliverance I now confirm and ratify. 'Go in peace.'\" The original Greek here (ὕπαγε εἰς εἰρήνην) implies more than this. It means \"Go for peace.\" Pass into the realm, the element of peace, in which henceforth thy life shall move. It is here obvious to remark that this malady represents to us the ever-flowing bitter fountain of sin, for which no styptic treatment can be found in human philosophy. The remedy is only to be found in Christ. To touch Christ's garment is to believe in his incarnation, whereby he has touched us, and so has enabled us by faith to touch him, and to receive his blessing of peace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Our Lord had lingered on the way to the house of Jairus, perhaps, as has already been suggested, that the crisis might first come, and that so there might be full evidence of his resurrection power. The ruler must have been agonized with the thought that, while our Lord lingered, the life of his dying child was fast ebbing away. And now comes the fatal message to him. Thy daughter is dead (ἀπέθανε); the aorist expresses that her death was now a past event. Why troublest thou the Master any further? (τί ἔτι σκύλλεις τὸν διδάσκαλον). The Greek word here is very strong. It is to vex or weary; literally, to flay. The messengers from the ruler's house had evidently abandoned all hope, and so probably would Jairus, but for the cheering words of our Lord, \"Fear not, only believe.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The words of the narrative, as they stand in the Authorized Version, are: As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. But there is good authority for the reading παρακούσας instead of εὐθέως ἀκούσας which requires the rendering, but Jesus, not heeding, or overhearing. This word (παρακούω) occurs in one other place in the Gospels, namely, in Matthew 18:17, \"And if he refuse to hear them (ἐὰν δὲ παρακούσῃ αὐτῶν).\" Here the word can only have the meaning of \"not heeding,\" or \" refusing to hear.\" This seems to be a strong reason for giving the word a somewhat similar meaning in this passage. And therefore, on the whole, \"not heeding\" seems to be the best rendering. Indeed, it seems to cover both meanings. Our Lord would overhear, and yet not heed, the word spoken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Here we have the first occasion of the selection of three of the apostles to be witnesses of things not permitted to be seen by the rest. The other two occasions are those of the transfiguration, and of the agony in the garden. We now follow our Lord and these three favored disciples, Peter and James and John, to the house of death. They are about to witness the first earnest of the resurrection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - St. Matthew here says (Matthew 9:23) that when Jesus came into the ruler's house, he\" saw the minstrels (τοὺς αὐλητὰς),\" i.e. the flute-players, \"and the people making a noise.\" This was the custom both with Jews and with Gentiles, to quicken the sorrow of the mourners by funeral dirges. The record of these attendant circumstances is important as evidence of the fact of death having actually taken place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39.- Some have regarded the words of our Lord, the child is not dead, but sleepeth, as really meaning that she was only in a swoon. But although she was actually dead in the ordinary sense of that word, namely, that her spirit hNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - They laughed him to scorn. He suffered this, in order that the actual death might be the more manifest, and that so they might the more wonder at her resurrection, and thus pass from wonder and amazement to a true faith in him who thus showed himself to be the Resurrection and the Life. He now put them all forth; and then, with his three apostles, Peter, James, and John, and the father and the mother of the child, he went in where the child was. The common crowd were not worthy to see that in which they would not believe. They were unworthy to witness the great reality of the resurrection; for they had been deriding him who wields this power. It is remarked by Archbishop Trench that in the same manner Elisha (2 Kings 4:33) cleared the room before he raised the son of the Shunammite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark5:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - The house was now set free from the perfunctory and noisy crowd; and he goes up to the dead child, and takes her by the hand and says, Talitha cumi; literally Little maid, arise.

And they were astonished with a great astonishment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 42, 43. - Here, as in other miracles, the restoration was immediate and complete: straightway the damsel rose up, and walked. Well might the father and the mother of the maiden and the three chosen apostles be amazed with a great amazement (ἐξέστησαν ἐκστάσει μεγάλῃ). And then, for the purpose of strengthening that life which he rescued from the jaws of the grave, our Lord commanded that something should be given her to eat. It has often been observed that in the examples of his resurrection power given by Christ there is a gradation:NEWLINENEWLINE1. The daughter of Jairus just dead.NEWLINENEWLINE2.

Nazareth would be about a day's journey from Capernaum. This was not the first public exercise of his ministry at Nazareth. Of that and its results St. Luke gives us the account (Luke 4:16). It would seem reasonable to suppose that, after the fame which he had now acquired, he should again visit the place where he had been brought up. His sisters were still living there. St. Mark here again uses the historical present ἔρχεται, \"he cometh,\" for which there is better authority than for ῆλθεν. His disciples follow him. Only the chosen three had been with him in the house of Jairus. The presence of the whole body of the disciples would be valuable at Nazareth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - As usual, he made the sabbath the special time for his teaching. And many hearing him were astonished. They were astonished at the ability, the sublimity, the holiness of his teaching, as well as at the signs and wonders by which he confirmed it. \"Many\" hearing him; not all. Some listened with faith; but \"the many\" (there is some authority for οἱ πολλοὶ)were envious of him. Whence hath this man these things? The expression, \"this man,\" is repeated, according to the best authorities, in the next clause, What is the wisdom that is given (not \"unto him,\" but) unto this man? There is a contemptuous tone about the expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Is not this the carpenter? St. Matthew (Matthew 13:55) says, \"the carpenter's son.\" We infer from this that our Lord actually worked at the trade of a carpenter, and probably continued to do so until he entered upon his public ministry. We may also infer that Joseph was now no longer living, otherwise it would have been natural for his name to have been mentioned here. According to St. Chrysostom, our Lord made ploughs and yokes for oxen. Certain]y, he often drew his similitudes from these things. \"No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God\" (Luke 9:62). \"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me \"(Matthew 11:29). Christ was the son of a carpenter. Yes; but he was also the Son of him who made the world at his will. Yea, he himself made the world. \"All things were made by him,\" the Eternal Word. And he made them for us, that we might judge of the Maker by the greatness of his work. He chose to be the son of a carpenter. If he had chosen to be the sou of an emperor, then men might have ascribed his influence to the circumstances of his birth. But he chose a humble and obscure condition, for this, among other reasons, that it might be acknowledged that it was his divinity that transformed the world. Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? Some have thought that these were literally brethren of our Lord, sons of Joseph and Mary. Others have considered that they were his legal half-brothers, sons of Joseph by a former marriage. This view is held by many of the Greek Fathers, and has something to recommend it. But, on the whole, the most probable opinion is that they were cousins of our Lord - sons of a sister of the Virgin Mary, also called Mary, the wife of Cleophas, Clopas, or Alpheeus. There is evidence that there were four sons of Clopas and Mary, whose names were James, and Joses, and Simon (or Symeon), and Judas. Mary the wife of Clopas is mentioned by St. Matthew (Matthew 27:56) as the mother of James the less and of Joses. Jude describes himself (Jude 1:5) as the brother of James; and Simon, or Symeon, is mentioned in Eusebius as the son of Clopas. It must be remembered also that the word ἀδελφός, like the Hebrew word which it expresses, means not only \"a brother,\" but generally \"a near kinsman.\" In the same way the \"sisters\" would be cousins of our Lord. According to a tradition recorded by Nicephorus (2:3), the names of these sisters or cousins were Esther and Tamar. And they were offended in him. They took it ill that one brought up amongst them as a carpenter should set himself up as a prophet and a teacher; just as there are those in every age who are apt to take it amiss if they see any one spring from a trade into the doctor's chair. But these Nazarencs knew not that Jesus was the Son of God, who of his great love for man vouchsafed to take a low estate, that he might redeem us, and teach us humility by his example. And thus this humility and love of Christ, which ought to have excited their admiration and respect, was a stumbling-block to them, because they could not receive it, or believe that God was willing thus to humble himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, etc. One reason for this is that it is almost natural for persons to hold of less account than they ought, those with whom they have been brought up and have lived on familiar terms. Prophets are commonly least regarded, and often most envied, in their own country. However unworthy may be the feeling, the inhabitants of a district, or members of a community, do not like to see one of themselves put above them, more especially a junior over a senior, or a man of humble origin over a man well born. But it should be remembered that God abhors the envious, and will withhold the wonders of his grace from those who grudge his gifts to others. The men of Nazareth, when they saw Christ eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and working at his trade, like others, despised him when he claimed respect and reverence as a Prophet, and especially because his relations according to the flesh were of humble condition; and Joseph more particularly, whom they supposed to be his real father, for they could not imagine or believe that he was born of a virgin, and had God alone for his Father.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - And he could there do no mighty work. This is a remarkable expression. He could do no mighty work there. The words imply want of power - that in some sense or other he was unable to do it. He did indeed perform some miracles. He laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them; but he wrought none of his greater miracles there. Of course, even these less striking miracles ought to have sufficed. in a miracle there must be the suspension of some known law of nature; and one clear instance of such suspension ought to be as conclusive as a hundred. Then it must be remembered that it is not God's method in his dealings with his creatures to force conviction upon them when the ordinary means prove insufficient. For men's actions must be free if they are to be made the test of judgment, and they would not be free if God constrained men to obey his will. The men of Nazareth had sufficient evidence had they not chosen to be blinded, and a greater amount of evidence would only have increased their condemnation. So their unbelief thwarted his purposes of mercy, and he went in and out amongst them like one hampered and disabled, marvelling at their unbelief, or rather marveling because of their unbelief (διὰ τὴν ἀπιστίαν αὐτῶν). The condition of mind of these Nazarenes was what caused amazement to the Saviour. At length he turned away from Nazareth, never, so far as we know, to visit it again; for this was their second opportunity, and the second occasion which they deliberately rejected him. What, however, they refused he immediately offered to others. He was not discouraged. He went round about the villages teaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - At Mark 3:7 we had the account of our Lord's selection of the twelve. Here we find the notice of their being first sent forth. Their names have already been recorded. He gave them authority - mark the imperfect (ἐδίδου) - over unclean spirits. St. Matthew (Matthew 10:1) adds, \"and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.\" But St. Mark here fixes the attention upon the great central object of Christ's mission - to contend against evil in every form, and especially to grapple with Satan in his stronghold in the hearts of men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only. St. Matthew says (Matthew 10:10), according to the best authorities (μηδὲ ῤάβδον), they were not to take a staff. St. Luke says the same as St. Matthew. The meaning is that they were not to make any special provision for their journey, but to go forth just as they were, depending upon God. Those who bad a staff might use it; those who had not one were not to trouble themselves to procure one. The scrip (πήρα) was the wallet for food. They were to take no money in their purse (μὴ εἰς τὴν ζώνην χαλκόν); literally, brass in their girdle. St. Mark, writing for Romans, uses this word for money. St. Luke, writing for Greeks, uses the term (ἀργύριον) \"silver.\" St. Matthew (Matthew 10:9) says, \"provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But be shod with sandals. This is quite consistent with what St. Matthew says (Matthew 10:9), that they were not to provide themselves with shoes (μηδὲ ὑποδήματα). According to St. Matthew, shoes are forbidden directly; according to St. Mark, they are forbidden by implication, where he says that they were to be shod with sandals. Shoes are here forbidden which cover the whole foot, not sandals which only protect the soles of the feet lest they should be injured by the rocky ground. The soil of Judaea was rocky and rough, and the climate hot. The sandals therefore protected the soles of the feet, and yet, being open above, kept the feet more cool, and therefore fit for the journey. It is worthy of our notice that, after our Lord's ascension, we find St. Peter using sandals when the angel, who delivered him out of prison, said to him (Acts 12:8), \"Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - There abide, till ye depart thence. They were not to change their lodgings in any place. This direction was given to them, lest, if they did, they might appear to be fickle and restless; or lest they might hurt the feelings of those with whom they had first lodged. And they were not to stay too long anywhere, lest they should be burdensome to any.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shake off the dust (τὸν χοῦν) literally, the soil - that is under your feet. St. Matthew and St. Luke use the word (κονιορτὸν) \"dust.\" A very significant action. The dust was shaken off as an evidence of the toil and labour of the apostles in journeying to them. It witnessed that they had entered the city and had delivered message, and that their message had been refused. The very dust, therefore, of the place was a defilement to them. \"It shall be more tolerable,\" etc. This clause is omitted by the best authorities; it was probably copied from St. Matthew.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went out, and preached that men should repent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They preached that men should repent. This was their great work, to which the miracles were subordinate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. It is hardly possible to separate this from the reference to the use of oil for the sick, in James 5:14. Unction was employed extensively in ancient times for medicinal purposes. It is recorded of Herod the Great by Josephus ('Antiq.,' 17:6, 5) that in one of his sicknesses he was \"immersed in a bath full of oil,\" from which he is said to have derived much benefit. The apostles used it, no doubt not only on account of its supposed remedial virtues, but also as an outward and visible sign that the healing was effected by their instrumentality in the name of Christ, and perhaps also because the oil itself was significant of God's mercy, of spiritual comfort and joy\" the oil of gladness.\" Neither this passage nor that in St. James can properly be adduced to support the ceremony of \"extreme unction;\" for in both these cases the result was that the sick were restored to health. The so-called sacrament of\" extreme unction \"is administered immediately before death, when the sick person is in articulo morris.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - This Herod is called by St. Matthew (Matthew 14:1) \"the tetrarch;\" and so also by St. Luke (Luke 9:7); though it should be noticed that St. Matthew, in the same context, at Ver. 9, calls him \"king.\" The word \"tetrarch\" properly means the sovereign or ruler of the fourth part of a territory. He is known as Herod Anti-pus, son of Herod the Great, who had appointed him \"tetrarch\" of Galilee and Peraea. Herod Antipas had married the daughter of Arctas, King of Arabia, but deserted her for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. John the Baptist is risen from the dead; that is, \"is risen in the person of Jesus Christ.\" St. Luke. (Luke 9:7) says that at first Herod was \"much perplexed (διηπόρει)\" \"about him. At length, however, as he heard more and more of the fame of Christ's miracles, he came to the conclusion that our Lord was none other than John the Baptist risen again. Such is the opinion of St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and others. At that time the views of Pythagoras respecting the transmigration of souls were generally current, and probably influenced the troubled mind of Herod. He had put to death an innocent and holy man; and it is a high testimony to the worth of the Baptist that, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, Herod should have come to the conclusion that he had risen from the dead, thus probably giving the lie to his own opinions as a Sadducee; and terrified lest the Baptist should now avenge his own murder. \"What a great thing,\" exclaims St. Chrysostom,\" is virtue! for Herod fears him, even though dead.\" It should not be forgotten that this is the same Herod who set Jesus at nought and mocked him, when Pilate sent him to him, in the hope of relieving himself of the terrible responsibility of condemning one whom he knew to be innocent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOthers said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In prison. Josephus ('Antiq.,' 18:5, 2) informs us that this prison was the fort of Machaerus, on the confines of Galilee and Arabia, and that there John was beheaded. Herod's father had built a magnificent palace within that fort; and so he may have been keeping the anniversary of his birthday there,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - For John said unto Herod. The Greek tense (ἔλεγε) implies more than the simple expression, \"he said;\" it implies a repeated warning. We learn from St. Matthew (Matthew 14:5) that Herod would have killed John before, but he feared the people. Here St. Mark says that Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not; for Herod feared John. There is no contradiction between the two evangelists. The case appears to have been this: that at first Herod desired to put John to death, because John had reproved him on account of Herodias. But by degrees John gained an influence over Herod by the force of his character, and by his holy life and teaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The words in the Authorized Version are, When he heard him, he did many things (πολλὰ ἐποίει), and heard him gladly. But according to the best authorities the reading should be (πολλὰ ἠπόρει), he was much perplexed. In St. Luke, as stated above, we have (διηπόρει), \"he was much perplexed.\" Nor is there any inconsistency in the next clause in St. Mark, if we accept this reading. Herod was not utterly depraved. There was to him a charm, not only in the character, but in the discourses of John the Baptist. But he was an inconsistent man, and was continually the victim of a conflict between the good and the evil within him, in which evil, alas! triumphed. Herodias, on the other hand, had always wished to get rid of John, as the stern and uncompromising reprover of her adultery and incest; and so at length she persuaded Herod to give way. \"For,\" says Bede, \"she feared lest Herod should at length repent, and yield to the exhortations of John, and dissolve this unreal marriage, and restore Herodias to her lawful husband.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The words should run thus: And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in καὶ εἰσελθούσης τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτῆς τῆς Ἡρωδιάδος. The intention of the evangelist is to point out that it was Herodias's own daughter who danced, and not a mere professional dancing-girl. Josephus mentions that dancing-women were admitted to feasts by the Jews; and Xenophon testifies to the same custom amongst the Greeks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? (τί αἰτήσομαι)- according to the best authorities (τί αἰτήσωμαι), What should I ask?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I will that thou forthwith give me in a charger (ἐπὶ πίνακι) the head of John the Baptist. John the Baptist seems to have had a presentiment of his speedy end when he said, \"He must increase, but must decrease.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And the king was exceeding sorry. We cannot suppose that this was a pretended grief. The true reason is doubtless to be found in the relentless animosity of Herodias. Herod must have known well that he could not be bound by his oath in reference to a petition so unreasonable and so iniquitous. Nevertheless he thought that \"the words of a king were law.\" St. Augustine says, \"The girl dances; the mother rages. A rash oath is made amidst the excitement and the voluptuous indulgence of the feast; and the savage desires of Herodias are fulfilled.\" For the sake of his oaths (διὰ τοὺς ὅρκους); the plural shows that he repeated the rash promise once and again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He sent forth an executioner (σπεκουλάτωρα); literally, a soldier of his guard; one of his body-guard, in constant attendance as messenger or executioner. It is a Roman word from speculari, to watch. St. Jerome relates that when the head of the Baptist was brought, Herodias barbarously thrust the tongue through with a bodkin, as Fulvia is said to have done over and over again, the tongue of Cicero; thus verifying what Cicero had once said while living, that \"nothing is more revengeful than a woman.\" Because they could not bear to hear the truth, therefore they bored through with a bodkin the tongue that had spoken the truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The taking up of the corpse by the disciples would seem to intimate that it lay uncared for and unburied until the disciples showed their respect for it. Josephus says that after the beheading, the mutilated remains were east out of the prison and left neglected. God's judgments at length found out Herod. For not long after this he was defeated by Aretas in a great battle, and put to an ignominious flight. Herodias herself and Herod were banished by a decree of the Roman Senate to Lyons, where they both perished miserably; and Nicephorus relates that Salome, the daughter of Herodias, died by a remarkable visitation. She fell through some treacherous ice over which she was passing, and fell through it in such a manner that her head was caught while the rest of her body sank into the water, and thus it came to pass that in her efforts to save herself her head was nearly severed by the sharp edges of the broken ice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The narrative, which had been interrupted by this parenthesis relating to John the Baptist, is now taken up again. The apostles. This is the only place where St. Mark calls them apostles. In the parallel passage, St. Luke (Luke 9:10) says that they told him all that they had done. St. Mark adds, with more detail, and whatsoever (ὅσα) they had taught. They gave him a full account of their mission.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Our Lord cared for his disciples. They required rest after the labour and excitement of their ministry; and it was impossible to find the needful refreshment and repose where they were so thronged by the multitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed into a desert place by ship privately.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And they went away in the boat (τῷ πλοίῳ) to a desert place apart - the boat, no doubt, which our Lord had ordered to be always in attendance upon him. We learn from St. Luke (Luke 9:10) that this desert place was near to \"a city called Bethsaida.\" It seems that there were two places called Bethsaida - one in Galilee proper, and the other to the north-east of the Sea of Galilee. It was to the neighborhood of this latter place that our Lord here directs the boat to take him. The other Bethsaida is mentioned lower down at Ver. 45. The word Bethsaida means the \"fish village.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - This is very graphic. The Greek in the first part of this verse runs thus, according to the best authorities: Καὶ εϊδον αὐτοὸς ὑπάγοντας καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτὸν πολλοί: And they - i.e. the people - saw them going, and many knew them. They saw them departing, and observed what direction the boat took, and then hastened thither on foot, and outwent them; and so were ready to meet them again on the opposite shore when they landed. The distance by land from the place where they started would be about twenty miles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Our Lord had gone to this desert place for retirement and rest; but finding the multitude waiting For him, his compassions were stirred, and he began to teach them many things. He was moved with compassion, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. No animal is more helpless, more stupid, more in need of a shepherd, than the sheep. St. Chrysostom observes that the scribes were not so much pastors as wolves, because, by teaching errors both by word and by example, they perverted the minds of the simple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And when the day was now far spent. The English, like the Greek, is here very idiomatic (καὶ ἤδη ὥρας πολλῆς γενομένης). The English is retained in the Revised Version as it came through the Authorized Version from Tyndale. The present participle γενομένης appears in the Sinaitic Manuscript and in the Cambridge Codex. His disciples came unto him, and said. The best reading is (καὶ ἔλεγον), and were saying. St. Matthew (Matthew 14:16) says, \"They need not depart; give ye them to eat.\" Thus our Lord prepared the way for his miracle, he detained the multitude till the day was far spent, so that the disciples might be induced to pray him to dismiss them. This would open the way for him to direct the disciples to feed them. And thus the miracle would appear all the more evident in proportion as they found themselves in a strait, and utterly destitute of the needful supplies of food for such a multitude in the desert. St. John's account here is much more full. He tells us (John 6:5) that Jesus, addressing Philip, said, \"Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?\" And he adds, \"This he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.\" Our Lord, it would seem, asked Philip rather than the others, because Philip was simple-minded, sincere, and teachable, rather than clever, and so was accustomed to ask things which appeared plain to others. We have an instance of this simplicity of mind in the question which he asks (John 14:8), \"Lord show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Two hundred pennyworth of bread. The penny, or \"denarius,\" was the chief Roman silver coin, worth about eight-pence halfpenny. Upon the breaking up of the Roman empire, the states which arose upon its ruins imitated the coinage of the old imperial mints, and in general called their principal silver coin the \"denarius.\" Thus the denarius found its way into this country through the Anglo-Saxons, and it was for a long period the only coin. Hence the introduction of the word into the Authorized Version. Two hundred pennyworth would be of the value of nearly seven pounds. But considering the constant fluctuation in the relation between money and the commodities purchased by money, it is in vain to require what number of loaves the same two hundred denarii would purchase at that time, although it was evidently the representation of a large supply of bread.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Five (loaves), and two fishes. St. John tells us (John 6:9) that the loaves were of barley, and that the fishes were small (ὀψάρια); St. Mark says δύο ἰχθύας. Barley bread was considered an inferior and homely kind of food, very inferior to bread made of wheat flour. The comparative value of the two kinds of bread is given in Revelation 6:6. \"A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny.\" The psalmist alludes to the greater excellence of wheat flour: \"He would have fed them also with the finest wheat flour\" (Psalm 81:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - All were to sit down by companies (συμπόσια συμπόσια) - St. Luke (Luke 9:14) says that the companies were about fifty each (ἀνὰ πεντήκοντα) - upon the green grass. St. John says (John 6:10) that \"there was much grass in the place.\" This indicates the time of the year. The grass was growing, and it was green. It would not be green in that district after April. Thus St. Mark's account of the state of the grass at that time (an account evidently repeated from an eye-witness) coincides with the account of St. John, who says that \"the Passover, a feast of the Jews, was at hand\" (John 6:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And they sat down in ranks (ἀνέπεσον πρασιαὶ πρασιαὶ); literally, they reclined. The Greek word πρασια means \"a garden plot\" or \"bed,\" literally, a bed of leeks. They were disposed symmetrically. Probably the English word \"ranks\" expresses the meaning as clearly as any could do. This arrangement was probably made, partly that the numbers might be better known, partly that all things might be done in an orderly manner, and that each might have his portion. St. Matthew's account (Matthew 14:21) seems to imply that the \"men\" were separated from the \"women and children.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - All the synoptists give our Lord's acts in the same words. The taking of the food into the hands would seem to have been a formal act before the\" blessing,\" or \"giving of thanks,\" for it. Probably our Lord used the ordinary form of benediction. This is one amongst other instances showing the fitness and propriety of\" grace before meat.\" In considering the miraculous action which followed the benediction, our reason is baffled. It eludes our grasp. It is best simply to behold in this multiplying of the food, both the bread and the fishes, an act of Divine omnipotence; not indeed now, as at the beginning, a creation out of nothing, for here there was the nucleus of the five loaves and the two fishes, but an act of creative development of the food in its best kind; for all the works of God are perfect, He gave (ἐδίδου) would be better rendered, he was giving. It was in his hands that the miracle was wrought, and the food continually multiplied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they did all eat, and were filled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 42, 43. - They did all eat, and were filled (ἐχορτάσθησαν). It might be rendered, were fulfilled, according to the old meaning of \"fulfill.\" It is probable that the women and children were a considerable number; for they would be, if possible, even more eager then the men to see the great Prophet. When all had eaten and were satisfied, they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fishes. St. John tells us that this was done by the express command of Christ (John 6:12); and the existence of these fragments, far more in quantity than the original supply, was a striking testimony to the reality of the miracle, and that there was enough and more than enough for all. It does not become us to pry too curiously into the method of our Lord's working; but the number of these baskets (κοφίνους), namely, twelve, seems to suggest that he first broke the loaves, and in breaking multiplied them, and distributed them into these baskets, one for each apostle, and that the food, as it was distributed by the disciples, was more and more multiplied, as needed, so that at length they brought back to Christ as many basketfuls of fragments as they had first received from him, and much more than the original supply. It is obvious here to remark that by this stupendous miracle our Lord showed himself to be the true Bread of life, by which the spiritual wants of all hungering souls may be supplied. \"For,\" says St. Augustine,\" he was the Word of God, and all the acts of the Word are themselves words for us. They are not as pictures, merely, to look at and admire; but as letters which we must seek to read and understand.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The other side. It would seem, as has already been stated, that there were two Bethsaidas (or \"places of fish\" - fish-villages) - one to the north-east of the Sea of Galilee, not far from where the Jordan enters it, called Bethsaida Julias; and the other on the western side of the sea itself, near to Capernaum. Again and again our Lord crossed this sea to escape the crowds who followed him about, and now wished \"to take him by force and make him a king.\" He desired for a time to be in retirement, in order that he might pray with the greater earnestness, and freedom from interruption. He also wished to make occasion for the miracle which was to follow, namely, the stilling of the tempest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 46, 47. - St. Mark is careful, like St. Matthew, to tell us that when the even was come he was alone on the land. Both the evangelists desire to call attention to the fact that, when night came on, the disciples were alone in their boat and Jesus alone on the land. It was nightfall; and St. John informs us that \"the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew.\" Then it was that the Lord left his place of prayer on the mountain, and walked upon the sea, that he might succor his disciples now distressed by the storm. It would appear that our Lord had been obliged to use a little pressure to induce his disciples to leave him: \"He constrained them (ἠνάγκασε τοὺς μαθητὰς αὑτοῦ) Verse 46 - And when he had sent them away (ἀποταξάμενος) - more literally, had taken leave of them, that is, the multitude - he departed into a mountain (εἰς τὸ ὄρος); literally, into the mountain; that is, the high table-land at the foot of which the multitude had been fed. Towards the north-east of the Sea of Galilee the land rises rapidly from the shore. To pray (προσεύξασθαι). This is a very full word, implying the outpouring of the heart to God. Our Lord did this that he might teach us in our prayers to shun the crowd, and to pray in silence and in secret, with collected mind. There is here, too, a special example for the clergy, namely, this: that when they have preached they should go apart and pray that God would make effectual that which they have delivered; that he would himself give the increase where they have planted and watered, and renew their spiritual strength, that they may return again to their labour refreshed by communion with him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - And when even was come. It was now advancing onwards into night; the wind was rising and blowing against them. Then it was that the Lord left his place of prayer on the mountain, that he might succor his disciples in their difficulties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 48-50. - And he saw them toiling in rowing. The Greek is, according to the best readings καὶ ἰδὼν (not εϊδεν) αὐτοὺς βασανιξομένους ἐν τῷ ἐλαύνειν. The word βασανιξομένους means more than \"toiling;\" it means literally, tormented. It is well rendered in the Revised Version by distressed. It was only by painful effort that they could make head against the driving storm blowing upon them from the west, that is, from the Mediterranean Sea. About the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking on the sea. The Jews formerly divided the night into three watches; but when Judaea became a Roman province they adopted the Roman division. The Romans changed the watches every three hours, lest through too long watches the guards might slumber at their posts. These periods were called \"watches.\" If the night was short, they divided it into three watches; if long, into four. Therefore the fourth watch began at the tenth hour of the night, that is, at three o'clock in the morning, and continued to the twelfth, that is, to six o'clock. It would seem, therefore, that this storm lasted for nine hours. During that time the disciples had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, that is about three Roman miles - eight furlongs - making a mile. The Sea of Galilee is not more than six miles broad at its widest part. They were therefore now (ἐν μέσῳ τῆς θαλάσσης) \"in the midst of the sea,\" as St. Mark expresses it; so that, after rowing for nine hours, they had hardly crossed more than half over the sea. The Sea of Galilee is, speaking roughly, about twelve miles from north to south and six from east to west. It may be asked why our Lord suffered them to be tempest-tossed so long; and the answer is:NEWLINENEWLINE1. It was a trial of their faith, so as to urge them to seek more earnestly the help of God.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It was a lesson to accustom them to endure bard-ness.NEWLINENEWLINE3. It made the stilling of so tedious and dangerous a storm all the more grateful and welcome to them at last. The Fathers find a fine spiritual meaning in this. Jerome says, \"The fourth watch is the last.\" So, too, St. Augustine, who adds that \"he who has watched the ship of his Church will come at length at the fourth watch, at the end of the world, when the night of sin and evil is ended, to judge the quick and the dead.\" Theophylact says, \"He allows his disciples to be tried by dangers, that they may be taught patience, and does not come to them till morning, that they may learn perseverance and faith.\" Hilary says, \"The first watch was the age of the Law, the second of the prophets, the third of the gospel, the fourth of his glorious advent, when he will find her buffeted by the spirit of antichrist and by the storms of the world. And by his reception into the ship and the consequent calm is prefigured the eternal peace of the Church after his second coming\" (see Wordsworth's 'New Testament:'St. Matthew 14). He walked on the sea. This he did by his Divine power, which he possessed as God, and which, when he pleased, he could assume as man. Infidelity is at fault here. Paulus the rationalist, revived the ridiculous idea that Christ walking on the sea merely meant Christ walking on the shore, elevated above the sea; but the interpretation was rightly denounced by Lavater as \"a laughable insult on logic, hermeneutics, good sense, and honesty.\" Was it because our Lord simply walked on the shore that the disciples \"cried out and were troubled\"? Was it merely for this that they were \"sore amazed at themselves beyond measure and wondered\"? Yet such are the shifts to which unbelief is reduced when it ventures to measure itself against the acts of Omnipotence. He would have passed by them. An expression something like that in St. Luke (Luke 24:28), \"He made as though he would go further,\" although there the Greek in St. Luke is different (προσεποιεῖτο πορρωτέρω πορεύεσθαι). Here it is ἤθελε παρελθεῖν: literally, he wished to pass by them; so at least it appeared to the disciples. It has been suggested that our Lord did this that the disciples might more clearly see how the wind was stilled in his presence. They supposed that it was an apparition (ἔδοξαν ὄτι φάντασμα εϊναι); literally, a phantom. Why did they suppose this? Partly from the idea that spectres appear in the night and in the darkness to terrify men, and partly because in the darkness they could not so readily recognize that it was Jesus. Then the fact that our Lord\" would bare passed by them,\" flitting past them as though he eared nothing for them and had nothing to do with them, but was going elsewhere; this must have increased their terror. But now came the moment for him to calm their fears. Straightway he talked with them soothingly. Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid. Now, Christ did this that he might teach his disciples to conquer fear and temptation, even when they are very great, and that so the deliverance and the consolation might impress them all the more powerfully and sweetly in proportion to their former terror. \"'It is I' - I, your Lord and Master, whom you know so well, and of whose goodness and omnipotence you have already had so much experience; I, your Master, who do not come to mock you as a phantom, but to deliver you both from fear and from storm.\" It will be observed that St. Mark omits all mention of Peter's act of faith \"in going down from the boat, and walking upon the waters to come to Jesus,\" as recorded by St. Matthew (Matthew 14:28). Throughout this Gospel, as already noticed, St. Peter is kept in the background.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 51, 52. - The amazement of the disciples was very great. Nor was the impression confined to them alone. St. Matthew (Matthew 14:33) tells us that they who were in the boat came and worshipped him. They felt, at least for the 'moment, that they were brought into awful nearness to One whose \"way is in the sea,\" and whose \"path is in the great waters,\" and whose \"footsteps are not known.\" They needed not, however, to have been so amazed, for they had just witnessed his power in the miracle of the loaves; but they understood not (ἐπὶ τοῖς ἄρτοις) concerning the loaves, but their heart was (πεπωρωμένη) hardened; literally, stupefied and blinded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - They came into the land of Gennesaret; literally (ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν η΅λθον εἰς Γεννησαρέτ), they came to the land unto Gennesaret. This was the plain on the western side of the sea sometimes called \"the lake of Gennesaret.\" The name Gennesaret (says Cornelius a Lapide) means \"a fertile garden.\" There was a city originally called \"Chinnereth\" or \"Cinneroth,\" mentioned in Joshua 19:25, which probably gave one of its names to this lake.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 54-56. - Straightaway the people knew him. Some, no doubt, had known him before, he was now the general object of interest and attraction wherever he went. They began to carry about on their beds (ἐπὶ τοῖς κραββάτοις) those that were sick, where they heard he was. The original is very expressive (ὅπου ἤκουον ὅτι ἐκεῖ ἐστι where they heard, He is there. But the best authorities omit ἐκεῖ. Villages, or cities, or fields (Greek, ἀγρούς); literally, country, where the pursuits of agriculture would be going on. They laid the sick in the streets (Greek, ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς) - literally, market-places; the proper rendering - that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment. The border (κράσπεδον) means the\" fringe\" or \"hem;\" the garment was the outer robe worn over the tunic. And as many as touched him were made whole (ὅσοι α}ν ἤψαντο αὐτοῦ ἐσώζοντο); ΧΧΧ might mean either \"him\" or \"it,\" that is, \"the border of his garment.\" But the difference is of little importance; for it was faith in those who touched which brought the healing virtue to the sick, whether they touched the Saviour himself or only his clothes.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark6:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Mark.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - These verses, according to the Greek construction, should run thus: And there are gathered together unto the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which had come from Jerusalem, and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands. The word (ἐμέμψαντο) translated in the Authorized Version, \"they found fault,\" does not appear in the best authorities. It seems to have been interpolated to help the construction. St. Mark explains the meaning of the word κοιναῖς (literally, common), by the word (ἀνίπτοις) \"unwashen.\" The disciples, doubtless, washed their hands, but they abstained from the multiplied ceremonial washings of the Pharisees, which they had received by tradition and punctiliously observed. The scribes and Pharisees, who had come from Jerusalem, were doubtless sent as spies, to watch and to report in no friendly spirit the proceedings of the great Prophet of Nazareth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Except they wash their hands oft. The Greek word here rendered \"oft\" is πυγμῇ: literally, with the fist, i.e. with the closed hand, rubbing one against the other. This word has caused a vast amount of criticism; and the difficulty of explaining it seems to have led to the adoption of a conjectural reading (πυκνῷς or πυκνῇ) rendered \"oft;\" crebro in the Vulgate. But the Syriac Peshito Version renders the Greek word by a word which means \"diligently,\" and it is interesting and helpful, as a matter of exegesis, to know that it also renders the Greek word (ἐπιμελῶς) in Luke 15:8 by the same Syriac synonym, \"diligently.\" The \"clenched fist\" implies vigor and resolution, and points to \"diligence,\" and there are very high authorities in favor of this rendering, as, Epiphanius, Isaac Casaubon, and Cornelius a Lapide, to say nothing of our best modern expositors. It is also adopted in the Revised Version. Holding the tradition of the elders. The Pharisees pretended that this tradition had been orally delivered by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, and then transmitted orally down to their time. These oral precepts were afterwards embodied in the Talmud.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And when they come from the market (ἀπὸ ἀγορᾶς); literally, and from the market-place; there is no verb in the principal manuscripts, although the Cambridge Codex has ὅταν ἔλθωσιν, and the old Latin gives redeuntes. In the market-place there would be every kind of men and things, clean and unclean, by contact with which they feared that they might be polluted; and so they considered that they had need to cleanse themselves from this impurity by a more careful and complete ablution. Another Greek word is used here, namely, βαπτίσωνται. In the former verse the word is νίψωνται, a more partial and superficial kind of washing than that implied in βαπτίζω. It should, however, be added that two of the great uncials, Vatican and Sinaitic, have ῤαντίσωνται, \"sprinkle themselves,\" instead of βαπτίσωνται ( an authority sufficient to justify the Revisers of 1881 in putting it into the margin. The washing of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels, and of tables. The words (καὶ κλινῶν) wrongly rendered, \"and of tables\" - because they could only mean \"couches\" - have not sufficient authority to be retained in the text. \"Cups\" (ποτηρίων) mean \"drinking vessels.\" The \"pot\" (ξεστὴς) is a Roman word, sextarius, a small liquid measure, the sixth part of a congius, corresponding nearly to the English gallon, so that ξεστὴς would be rather more than a pint measure. Brasen vessels. These would probably be copper vessels, such as are still used in Syria for cooking purposes. These are particularly mentioned. Earthenware vessels would be broken. Which they have received to hold (α} παρέλαβον κρατεῖν); literally, which they received to hold: observe the aorist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Law of Moses prohibited contact with many things deemed to be unclean; and if any one had touched them he was counted unclean, so that he might not approach the temple until he had cleansed himself by the washing prescribed in the Law; the design being that by means of these ceremonial and bodily washings the Jews might be awakened to the necessity of spiritual cleansing. Hence the Jews, and especially the Pharisees, who wished to be esteemed more righteous than others, placing their whole religion in these external ceremonies, frequently washed themselves before their meals, and even at their meals. At the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee we read that there were placed \"six waterpots of stone (λίθιναι ῦδρίαι)\" for these purifying purposes; so that if any Jew had by accident come into contact with any unclean thing, and so had contracted any ceremonial impurity, he might remove it. This, however, was only a custom, and not a thing of legal obligation until it was exalted into a law by the Pharisees. Now, this punctilious observance of traditions by the Pharisees and other Jews yielded little or no religious profit; for it occupied their time with external purifications, and so drew away their attention from the duty of far greater moment - the cleansing of the soul from sin. They made clean \"the outside of the cup and platter,\" but neglected the inward cleansing of the heart. Therefore our blessed Lord, who came to put an end to the old ceremonial law, and to these vain and frivolous traditions which now overlaid it, and who wished to direct all the care of his disciples to the making of the heart clean, cared not to enforce these external washings upon his disciples, although he did not say this in so many words to the Pharisees, lest he should provoke their envy and their malice. He therefore meets their question in another way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Our Lord quotes against them a prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 29:13), This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men. The prophet here gives the cause of the blindness of the Jews, because they honored God with their lips, while their heart was far from him; and their worship of him (for that is the meaning of \"their fear\") was the commandment of men, which they had been taught; that is, they worshipped God, not according to that spiritual worship which he had commanded, but after the traditions of men and of their own scribes, partly futile, partly perverse, and contrary to God's Law. So he says, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you. The word is καλῶς, \"excellently - beautifully - did he prophesy concerning you (τῶν ὑποκριτῶν), the hypocrites.\" Not that the prophet had the hypocrites of our Saviour's time in his mind when he uttered these words, but that the Spirit of God which was within him enabled him to describe accurately the character of those who seven centuries afterwards would be doing the same things as their forefathers. And observe how they were punished. For as they gave a lip-service only to God, praising him with their mouth indeed, but giving their heart to vanity and the world; so God on his part would give them the words only - the shell, so to speak, the letter which killeth; but take away from them the kernel the spirit and the life, so that they might not lay hold of it nor taste it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Here the word καλῶς is repeated. Full well (kalw = ) do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition. It is as though our Lord said, \"Your traditions are not instituted by God, or by his servants the prophets, but they are modern inventions, which you desire to defend, not out of love or reverence for them, but because you are the successors of those who invented them, and arrogate to yourselves the power of adding to them and making similar new traditions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Our Lord now gives an example of one of these human traditions. Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; - that is, obey and love them, and succor them, if they need it; for here \"honor\" means not only reverence and love, but support, as is clear from Ver. 12 - and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death; that is, let him \"surely die,\" without any hope of pardon. Our Lord means this: \"That if he who by words only speaks evil of his father or his mother is, by law, guilty of death, how much more is he guilty of death who wrongs them by deed, and deprives them of that support which he owes them by the law of nature; and not only so, but teaches others so from Moses' seat, as you scribes and Pharisees do when you say, 'It is Corban.'\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God - these words, \"that is to say, Given to God,\" are St. Mark's explanation of \"corban\" - ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered. Now, this the scribes and Pharisees did for their own covetous ends. For most of them were priests, who received offerings made to God as his ministers, and then converted them to their own uses. In this they greatly erred; because the obligation of piety by which children are bound to support their parents when they need it, is a part of the law of nature, to which every vow, every oblation, ought to yield. Thus, if any one had devoted his goods to God, and his father or his mother became needy, those goods ought to be given to his parents and not to the temple. The word \"corban\" is a Hebrew word, meaning \"that which is brought near,\" \"a gift or offering to God.\" Hence, figuratively, the place where these offerings were deposited was called the \"corbanas,\" or, \"sacred treasury\" (see Matthew 27:6, κορβανᾶν). Hence to say of anything, \"It is Corban,\" was to say that it had a prior and more sacred destination. And when it was something that a parent might need, to say, \"It is Corban,\" i.e. it is already appropriated to another purpose, was simply to refuse his request and to deny him assistance, and so to break one of the first of the Divine commandments. Thus the son, by crying \"Corban\" to his needy parents, shut their mouths, by opposing to them a scruple of conscience, and suggesting to them a superstitious fear. It was as much as to say, \"That which you ask of me is a sacred thing which I have devoted to God. Beware, therefore, lest you, by asking this of me, commit sacrilege by converting it to your own uses.\" Thus the parents would be silenced and alarmed, choosing rather to perish of hunger than to rob God. To such extremities did these covetous scribes and Pharisees drive their victims, compelling a son to abstain from any kind offices for his father or his mother. St. Ambrose says, \"God does not seek a gift wrung out of the necessities of parents.\" Making void (ἀκυροῦντες); literally, depriving it of its authority, annulling. In Galatians 3:17 the same word is rendered \"disannul.\" By your traditions; the traditions, that is, by which they taught children to say \"Corban\" to their parents. Observe the words, \"your tradition\" (τῇ παρδόσει ὑμῶν); your tradition, as opposed to those Divine traditions which God has sanctified, and his Church has handed down from the beginning. And many such like things ye do. This is added by St. Mark to fill up the outline, and to show that this was only a sample of the many ways in which the commandment of God was twisted, distorted, and annulled by these rabbinical traditions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMaking the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - In the Authorized Version the beginning of this verse runs thus: \"And when he had called all the people unto him, he said.\" But according to the best authorities, the adverb πάλιν should be inserted, and the words will run as follows: - And he called to him the multitude again. It is probable that he had waved them from him while he held this discourse with the scribes from Jerusalem. But now he calls the people near to him again, that all might hear that which concerned all alike. It is probable, indeed, that this discussion with the scribes may have taken place in the house, into which he again returned after having made this authoritative declaration to the multitude. The words are given with more emphasis here than as recorded by St. Matthew. Every one was solemnly invited to hearken and understand, while he announced a principle of the highest importance. Our Lord did not intend to disparage the difference between clean and unclean meats as it had been laid down in the Levitical Law. His object rather was to clear that teaching from the obscurities in which it had been involved by the scribes and Pharisees, who laid stress only on external acts. His object was to show that all impurity springs from the heart; and that, unless the heart is cleansed, all external washings are in vain. It is as though he said, \"The scribes teach you that it is not lawful to eat with unwashen hands because unwashen hands make the food clean, and unclean food defiles the soul. But in this they err; because not that which enters from without into the mouth, but that which proceeds from within through the mouth, and so from the heart, if it be impure, - this defiles the man;\" as he more fully explains at ver. 21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man have ears to hear, let him hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - This verse has some good authority, but not sufficient to be retained in the text. The Revisers of 1881 have placed it in the margin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Our Lord, having proclaimed this great principle to the multitude in the presence of their teachers, the scribes and Pharisees, returned into the house (the true reading is here εἰς οϊκον, without the article). It means, of course, the house where he was lodging. And then his disciples asked of him the parable. St. Matthew (Matthew 15:15) says that the question was put to him by St. Peter speaking in the name of the other disciples - another instance of the reserve main-rained in this Gospel with reference to this apostle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - Our Lord had already, in his sermon on the mount, taught his disciples fully wherein purity or impurity of heart consists, and he might, therefore, with good reason, ask them how it was that they, even they who had been so favored by being constantly with him, had forgotten or misunderstood him. Our Lord's illustration is physically accurate. The portion carried off is that which by its removal purifies what remains. The part which is available for nourishment is, in its passage through the system, converted into chyle, the matter from which the blood is formed. What is not available for nourishment passes away into the ἀφεδρών, or draught, Purging all meats. The most approved reading here is undoubtedly the masculine (καθαρἰζων), and not the neuter (καθαρίζον). This change of reading compels a somewhat different construction. Accepting, therefore, the masculine as the true reading, the only possible rendering is that which makes this last clause a comment by the evangelist upon our Lord's previous words, in which he indicates to the reader that our Lord intended by this illustration to show that no food, of whatever kind, when received with thanksgiving, can make a man unclean. The clause must, therefore, be connected with the preceding words, by the introduction of the words, in italics, \"This he said, making all meats clean.\" The passage, thus rendered, becomes a very significant exposition of what has gone before. It is well worthy of notice that this explanation is to be found in St. Chrysostom (Homily on St. Matthew 15.): Ὁ δὲ Μάρκος φησὶν ὅτι καθαρίζων τὰ βρώματα ταῦτα ἔλεγεν: \"But Mark affirms that he said these things, making the meats clean.\" It may be added that this explanation agrees finely with the words in Acts 10:15, \"What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-23. - From within, out of the heart of men; that is, from the reason and the will, of which the heart is the symbol and the labouratory. For the heart ministers the vital fore to the intellect to enable it to understand, and to the will to enable it to live, although the seat of the intellect is in the brain. St. Mark's enumeration of evil things is in a somewhat different order from that of St. Matthew; and he adds to St. Matthew's list (ἀφροσύνη), foolishness, showing how all evil terminates in the loss of all moral and intellectual illumination. All these evil things proceed from within: and defile the man. Dr. Morison, in his admirable commentary on St. Mark, well observes here that \"these things have an inward origin, and are vomited forth from the crater of the heart or soul;\" and further on he says, \"In a little sphere of things, and as regards acts, though not as regards substances or essences, men may be spoken of as creators. Men, that is to say, are the efficient causes of their own choices. If they were not, they would not be really free. If it was not so, there would be no real responsibility.\" St. Matthew (Matthew 15:20) adds here, \"But to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.\" This is the end and scope of the parable, which is to show that unwashen hands and unclean meats defile not a man, but only an impure and depraved will. It seems almost needless to observe that our Lord does not condemn the washing of the hands before meats as a thing in itself in any way wrong. All nations approve of ablutions as tending to cleanliness and health.NEWLINENEWLINE\"Dant famuli manibus lymphas, Cereremque canistrisNEWLINEExpediunt, tousisque ferunt mantelia villis.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Virgil, 'Aeneid,' 1:701, 702.) It was thought sordid and mean to sit down to meals with unwashen hands. Whence not the clergy only, but the people, washed their hands before prayer. The moral of all is this, how carefully is the heart to be guarded, instructed, and adorned, seeing that it is the instrument and labouratory of all evil and all good, of all vice and all virtue! \"Keep thy heart with all diligent,\" so that nothing may enter therein and nothing go out therefore and you not be conscious of it, and your reason may not approve; \"for out of it are the issues of life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these evil things come from within, and defile the man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Our Lord now passes out of Galilee into a heathen country, Syro-phoenicia, into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, that he might begin to impart his miracles and his doctrine, which the scribes and Pharisees had rejected, to the Gentiles. There is not sufficient authority for omitting \"Sidon\" from the text. Both these cities were renowned for their extensive commerce and for their wealth. It is probable that the true reading in Ver. 31, which will be noticed presently, may have led to the omission by some authorities of \"Sidon\" here. But there is really no inconsistency in retaining the words \"and Sidon\" here; and accepting the reading\" through Sidon\" there. Tyro, which was the capital of Phoenicia, lay to the south, bordering on Judaea; Sidon to the north: and multitudes flocked to Christ from these parts. He entered into a house, and would have no man know it: and he could not be hid. He would have no man know it, partly for the sake of quiet, and partly lest he should rouse the Jews more bitterly against him, and give them occasion to cavil that he was not the Messiah promised to the Jews, because, having left them, he had turned to the Gentiles. St. Mark (Mark 3:8) has already informed us that his fame had spread to those about Tyro and Sidon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-27. - The construction of this verse is Hebraistic (see Acts 15:17). Instead of ἀκούσασα γὰρ, the approved reading is ἀλλ εὐθὺς ἀκούσασα: But straightway a woman, whose young daughter literally, little daughter; St. Mark is fond of diminutives - had an unclean spirit. All ages were liable to this incursion of unclean spirits. The woman seems to have come from a distance. She was a Greek - that is, a Gentile - a Syro-phoenician by race, as distinguished from the Libyan Phoenicians, of Carthage. She was a descendant from those seven nations of Canaan which had been driven out by God's command. They were called in their own language \"Canaanites,\" And she besought him (ἠρώτα); literally, asked him. St. Matthew (Matthew 15:22) says that \"she cried (ἐκραύγασεν), have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David.\" Aristotle says that \"parents love their children more than their children love them; because love descends, and because parents desire that their children should survive them, that they may live on in their children, as it were, after death; that they become, so to speak, immortal through their children, and possess that eternity, which they cannot have in themselves, in their children and their children's children.\" St. Matthew (Matthew 15:23) tells us that at first \"he answered her not a word,\" and he does not record the remarkable saying, Let the children first be filled, which in St. Mark precedes the words, it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs. Dogs abound in Palestine and the surrounding districts, but they are not cared for. They go about in packs, with no particular masters and no particular homes. They seem to be chiefly useful as scavengers. Nevertheless, the dog of the East is amenable to kindness shown him by man, and there, as in England, children and young dogs soon become friendly. It is of (κυνάρια) \"little dogs\" that our Lord here speaks. Our Lord here speaks after the manner of the Jews, who called the Gentiles dogs, as distinguished from themselves, the children of the kingdom. Let the children first be filled. Suffer me first to heal all the Jews who need my help. Our Lord makes at first as though he would refuse her request; and yet it is not an absolute denial. There might be hope for her when the children were filled. Thus Christ oftentimes deals with holy souls, namely, by humbling and mortifying them when they desire anything at his hands, in order that with yet greater importunity and humility they may seek and obtain it. St. Chrysostom says, \"Whether we obtain that which we seek for, or whether we obtain it not, let us ever persevere in prayer. And let us give thanks, not only if we obtain, but even if we fail to obtain. For when God denies us anything, it is no less a favor than if he had granted it; for we know not as he does what is most expedient for us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - In this verse there is a slight change of reading, causing a change of rendering; namely, thus: Yea, Lord: even - καὶ instead of καὶ γὰρ the dogs τὰ κυνάρια the little dogs - under the table eat of the children's crumbs. Observe the antithesis: \"the children\" (the little daughter) sitting at the table; the \"little dogs\" under the table. It is as though she said, \"Give me, most gracious Lord, only a crumb (a small mercy compared with thy greater mercies), the healing of my little daughter, which may fall as it were obiter from thee upon us Canaanites and Gentiles, and be gratefully picked up as one of thy lesser benefits.\" Cornelius a Lapide enlarges beautifully upon this: \"Feed me, then, as a little dog. To me, a poor Gentile, let a crumb of thy grace and mercy be vouchsafed; but let the full board, the plentiful bread of grace and righteousness, be reserved for the Jewish children. I cannot leave the table of my Lord, whose little dog I am. No; if you spurn me away with your foot, or with a blow, I will go away; but I will come back again, like a little dog, through another door. I will not be driven away by blows. I will not let thee go until thou hast given me what I ask of thee.' For this Canaanite constrains Christ, arguing her case from his own words, prudently, modestly, forcibly, and with a humble faith which perceives that he is not unwilling to be overcome by petition and by reason. Indeed, she entangles him in the meshes of his own words. So great is the plenteousness of his table, that it shall abundantly suffice for her if she may but partake of the crumbs which fall from the table of his children.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - St. Matthew says here (Matthew 15:28), \"O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.\" If we suppose St. Mark's words to come in after St. Matthew's words \"be it done unto thee even as thou wilt,\" the two narratives are perfectly consistent. Our Lord could no longer restrain himself, or resist these wonderful appeals of faith. Overcome by the skillful reasoning and importunity of the Canaanite, he gives her that which she asks, and more. He heals her daughter, and he sets a crown of gold upon her head. It is here obvious to remark that this child vexed by the unclean spirit represents the soul tempted by Satan and polluted by sin. In such a condition we must distrust our own strength, and rely only on Christ, and call upon him with humility and repentance; acknowledging ourselves to be but as dogs in his sight; that is, miserable sinners; yet not such as that we should despair of pardon, but rather that we should hope for the mercy of Christ the greater we feel our misery to be. For it is worthy of a great Saviour to cleanse and save great sinners. Again, this Gentile daughter represents the Church of the Gentiles, which, shut out from salvation by the justice of God, enters the kingdom of heaven through the door of mercy. Here was a great conversion indeed; for now the Jews through their unbelief change places with the Gentiles, and, like them, can only be admitted through the same gate of Divine mercy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - There is an inversion in the order of the clauses in this verse, according to the best authorities. The words should run thus: And she went away unto her house, and found the child (τὸ παιδίον) laid upon the bed, and the devil gone out. She found her little daughter set free from the possession, but exhausted by the convulsions which he caused in departing from her; weary with the violence of the struggle, but restful and composed. So the sinful soul, set free from sin by the absolution of Christ, rests upon the couch of a conscience pacified by the blood of Christ, and at peace with God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - According to the most approved authorities this verse should be read thus: And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis. St. Matthew (Matthew 15:29) simply says that he \"departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee.\" But from the more full statement of St. Mark we learn that he made a circuit, going first northwards through Phoenicia, with Galilee on his right, as far as Sidon; and thence probably over the spurs of Libanus to Damascus, mentioned by Pliny as one of the cities of the Decapolis. This would bring him probably through Caesarea Philippi to the eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee. Here, according to St. Matthew, he remained for a time in the mountainous district above the plain; choosing this position apparently for the sake of quiet and retirement, as also that, being conspicuous to all from the mountain, he might there await the multitude coming to him, whether for instruction or for healing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - They bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech (πωφὸν καὶ μογιλάλον). The radical sense of κωφός (from κόπτω) is \"blunt\" or \"dull;\" and so it is used to represent both deafness and dumbness. But in St. Mark it means deafness as distinguished from dumbness (see Mark 9:95). This patient, however, was not ἄλαλος absolutely, but μογιλάλος, i.e. he spoke with difficulty. Long-continued deafness is apt to produce imperfect utterance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - And he took him aside from the multitude privately. This was done, no doubt, to fix the attention of the afflicted man upon himself, and upon the fact that he was about to act upon his ears and his tongue. And he put (ἔβαλε) - literally, cast or thrust - his fingers into his ears. The action was very significant. It was as though he said, \"I am about to open a passage for hearing through these ears.\" And he spat, and touched his tongue; that is, he touched his tongue with saliva from his own sacred lips. These symbolical actions must have had a great meaning for the afflicted man. They were a tableau vivant, an acted metaphor, teaching him what he might expect from the mercy of Christ. The analogy of the miracle recorded in St. John (John 9:6) should be noticed here. It is an interesting circumstance (noticed in the 'Speaker's Commentary') that, in the Latin Church, the officiating priest touches the nostrils and ears of those who are to be baptized, with saliva from his own mouth. We may be assured that, in the case before us, these signs used by our Lord were intended to awaken the afflicted man's faith, and to stir up in him the lively expectation of a blessing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. He looked up to heaven, because from thence come all good things - words for the dumb, hearing for the deaf, healing for all infirmities; and thus he would teach the infirm man by a manifest sign to what quarter he was to look for the true source of his cure. he sighed (ἐστέναξε); literally, he groaned. Why did our Lord sigh at such a moment? We know indeed that he was \"a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief;\" but now we might almost have expected a momentary smile of loving joy when he was about to give back to this afflicted man the use of these valuable instruments of thought and action. But he sighed even then; for he was touched with the feeling of human infirmity, and no doubt his comprehensive eye would take in the vast amount of misery, both bodily and spiritual, which has come upon the world through sin; and this, too, immediately after having looked up to heaven, and thought of the realm of bliss which for a time he had left \"for us men, and for our salvation.\" Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. This word is, of course, addressed to the man himself; and the evangelist has retained the original Syro-Chaldaic word, as he has retained \"Talitha cumi\" elsewhere: so that the actual word which passed through the Saviour's lips, and restored speech and hearing to the afflicted, might be handed on, as doubtless it will be, to the end of time. The word applies of course, primarily, though not exclusively, to the ear; for not only were his ears opened; but the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36, 37. - He charged them (διεστέλλετο). The word is a strong one: \"he gave them clear and positive orders.\" The injunction seems to have been given, both to the deaf and dumb man, and to those who brought him. And it was given partly, no doubt, for his own sake, and for reasons connected with his gradual manifestation of himself to the world, and partly for the instruction of his disciples, and to show that he did not desire by his miracles to win the vain applause of men. St. Augustine says that \"our Lord desired, by putting this restraint upon them, to teach how much more fervently they ought to preach him, whom he commissions to preach, when they who were forbidden could not be silent.\" He hath done all things well. He did nothing that the Pharisees, captious and envious as they were, could reasonably find fault with. St. Matthew (Matthew 15:30, 31) intimates that at this time our Lord exhibited a vast number of miracles, a bright galaxy of wonders, amongst which this shone out conspicuously, as a very prominent and instructive one. But, indeed, \"he went about doing good.\" His whole life on earth was one connected, continued manifestation of loving kindness.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark7:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Mark.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - The opening words of the first verse seem to imply that our Lord remained for some time on this, the north-east, side of the Sea of Galilee. The multitude being very great. The word here rendered \"very great\" is παμπόλλου, a word not to be found anywhere else in the New Testament. But according to the best authorities, the true reading is πάλιν πόλλου; so that the words would run, when there was again a great multitude. It has been supposed with some reason that, as an old ecclesiastical Lection began with this chapter, this may have led to the substitution of παμπόλλου for πάλιν πόλλου, in order to make the Lection more complete in itself, avoiding this reference to the context. In the original Greek construction the word ὄχλος, in the singular, is disintegrated in the next clause by a passage into the plural (καὶ μὴ ἐχόντων τί φάγουσι). This is properly marked in the Revised Version by the words, a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat. Our Lord has compassion on them. He desires not only to heal the sick, but to feed the hungry. We may here notice the burning zeal of the multitude. They were so intent upon hearing Christ, that they forgot to provide themselves with the necessaries of life. They continued with him for three days and had nothing to eat. Whatever small supplies they might have Brought with them at first were now exhausted; and still they remained, \"esteeming his words to be more than their necessary food.\" Our Lord on his part was so. full of zeal for their good, that during all that time, with little interval, he had been preaching to them, denying himself rest, refreshment, and sleep. So true were those words of his, \"My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For divers of them came from far. These words, as they stand in the Authorized Version, might be supposed to be an observation thrown in by the evangelist himself. But the correct rendering of ἥκασι, is not \"came,\" but have come, or rather, are come and instead of τινὲς γὰρ at the beginning of the clause, the more correct reading is καὶ τινὲς. This change makes the clause almost of necessity to be a part of our Lord's own words going before. It was not until the third day that our Lord interposed with a miracle, when the people were absolutely without food, and would therefore feel more sensibly the blessing as well as the greatness of the miracle. Their extremity was his opportunity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place? St. Matthew (Matthew 15:33) gives the question thus: \"Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place, as to fill so great a multitude?\" The disciples, measuring the difficulty by human reason, thought that it was impossible to find so many loaves in the desert. But Christ in this necessity, when human resources fail, supplies Divine; and meanwhile the disciples' estimate of the impossibility illustrates the grandeur of the miracle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The seven loaves and the few small fishes appear to have been the modest provision for our Lord and his disciples. As he often retired into the desert, they were no doubt accustomed to carry small supplies about with them, though poor and scanty. In the former miracle of the multiplying of the loaves (Mark 6:35), we find that their stock consisted of five loaves and two fishes. It was, of course, just as easy for our Lord to multiply the smaller quantity as the larger. But he chose so to order it that the original quantity of food, as well as the number requiring to be fed, should in each case be different, in order that it might be evident that they were different occasions, although the miracles were of the same kind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And he commandeth the multitude to sit down (ἀναπεσεῖν) - literally, to recline - on the ground (ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς); not the green grass, as before. It was a different season of the year. \"He gave thanks.\" In this expression is included the recognition of the Divine power to enable him to work the miracle. Christ indeed, as God, was able of his own will and by his own power to multiply the loaves. But as man he gave thanks. And yet, as Dr. Westcott excellently remarks, \"The thanksgiving was not for any uncertain or unexpected gift. It was rather a proclamation of his fellowship with God. So that the true nature of prayer in the case of our blessed Lord was the conscious realization of the Divine will, and not a petition for that which was contingent.\" And having given thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples (ἔκλάσε καὶ ἐδίδου). Observe the aorist and the imperfect. The giving was a continual act, till all were filled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And they did eat, and were filled (ἐχορτάσθησαν). Wycliffe renders it, \"were fulfilled;\" according to the original meaning of \"to fulfill,\" namely, \"to fill full.\" And they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets - as many as there were loaves. In the record of the other similar miracle, the number of baskets corresponded to the number of the disciples. Here, as in the former miracle, far more food remained after all were fed than the original supply on which our Lord exercised his miraculous power; for each basket would contain much more than one loaf. The Greek word here rendered \"basket\" (σπυρίς) is a different word from that used for \"basket\" in the record of the other miracle (Mark 6:43). There it is κόφινος. The κόφινος was a hand-basket of stout wicker-work. The was a much larger basket, made of a more flexible material, perhaps \"rushes,\" like our \"frail.\" It was by means of such a basket, called in Acts 9:25 σπυρίς, but σαργάνη in 2 Corinthians 11:33, that St. Paul was let down through a window at Damascus. This supplies another evidence, if it were needed, that these two recorded miracles took place on different occasions. Cornelius a Lapido mentions an opinion that the σπυρίς was double the size of the κόφινος, a large basket carried by two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He entered into a ship (εἰς τὸ πλοῖον) - literally, into the boat; probably the same boat which he had ordered to be in attendance upon him (Matthew 3:9) - and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. (St. Matthew 15:39) has \"the coasts of Magdala;\" more properly, \"the borders of Magaden.\" This place was in all probability about the middle of the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, where now stand the ruins of the village of El-Mejdel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the Pharisees came forth - St. Matthew (Matthew 16:1) says that the Sadducees came with them - and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. They had already asked for a sign from heaven (Matthew 12:38); but now this miracle gives them occasion to ask again. For when they saw how greatly it was extolled by the multitudes who had benefited by it, it was easy for them to urge that it was an earthly sign, and might have been wrought by him who is called \"the God of this world;\" and so they insinuated that he had wrought this miracle as well as his other miracles by the power of Satan. Therefore they seek a sign from heaven, that he who dwells in heaven might thus bear witness that he came from God, and that his doctrine was Divine; the Pharisees probably meant that if he did this they would believe in him as the Messiah, and lead the people to the same faith. The Sadducees, who were practically atheists, thought that no sign could be given from heaven by God, seeing that in their opinion it was doubtful whether there was any God to give it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He sighed deeply in his spirit (ἀναστενάξας) Another graphic touch of this evangelist; such as he had learnt in all probability from St. Peter. The word occurs nowhere but here. It is the outcome of grief and indignation, in which, however, grief predominates. There shall no sign be given unto this generation (εἰ δοθήσεται σημεῖον). This is a Hebrew idiom, based upon a form of taking an oath which prevailed amongst the Jews. The full form would be, \"God do so and so to me, if so and so.\" Hence the hypothetical part of the clause came to be used alone, expressing a very strong form of denial or refusal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And he left them, and again embarking - ἐμβὰς for ἐμβὰς εἰς τὸ πλοῖον - departed to the other side. Again and again our Lord crossed this sea, that he might instruct the Galileans dwelling on either side; in fulfillment of Isaiah 9:1, \"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,... by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And they had forgotten (ἐπελάθοντο) - literally, they forgot - to take bread (ἄρτους); loaves. The conversation which follows took place on the boat while they were crossing. The passage would take perhaps six hours. And it was during that time that they would want food; for when they reached the port, they would find it in abundance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. St. Matthew (Matthew 15:6) says, \"Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees;\" thus St. Mark identifies the leaven of the Sadducees with that of Herod. \"Leaven\" here means \"doctrine.\" They were not to beware of this, so far as the Pharisees rightly taught and explained the Law of Moses; but only so far as they corrupted that Law by their own vain traditions, contrary to the Law of God, St. Luke (Luke 12:11) calls this leaven \"hypocrisy;\" because the Pharisees only regarded outward ceremonies, and neglected the inward sanctification of the Spirit. St. Jerome says, \"This is the leaven of which the Apostle speaks where he says, 'A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.' Marcion and Valentinus and all heretics have had this kind of leaven, which is on every account to be avoided. Leaven has this property, that, however small it may be in quantity, it spreads its influence rapidly through the mass. And so if only a little spark of heretical doctrine be admitted into the soul, speedily a great flame arises, and envelopes the whole man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - According to the most approved readings, this verse should be read thus: And they reasoned one with another, saying, We have no bread. There is something very artless and simple in this narrative. Our Lord speaks of\" leaven;\" and the mention of this word reminds the disciples that they had forgotten to bring bread with them in the boat; and fearing lest Christ should direct them, according to his wont, to land on some desert shore, they were in some anxiety how they might obtain what they would need; and so they disputed among themselves; one, it may be, throwing the blame upon another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And when Jesus knew it (καὶ γνοὺς ὁ Ἰησοὺς) - literally and far more correctly, and Jesus perceiving it - he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? Jesus perceived the direction in which their thoughts were moving, by the power of his divinity. It is as though he said, \"Why reason ye because ye have no bread, as though I was referring to natural things, and speaking concerning bread for the body, and wishing you to be anxious about that; as though I could not provide that for you, if nccessary, just as easily here on the sea as I did just now in the desert?\" Dr. John Lightfoot ('Hebrew Excrcitations on St. Matthew,' vol. 2:p. 201) says, \"The rule of the Jews was very strict as to the kind of leaven that was to be used; and the disciples supposed that our Lord was alluding to this when he cautioned them to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees.\" Perhaps they also thought that our Lord was conveying a silent reproof to them for not having brought a sufficient supply of bread with them. The whole incident, while it shows their transparent simplicity of character, exhibits also their dulness of apprehension.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaving eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - Here St. Mark is as careful as St. Matthew to mention the details of the two miracles, even to the reference to the two kinds of baskets in which the fragments were gathered up. They had a distinct recollection of the facts, but they had failed to catch their spiritual import.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - How is it that ye do not understand? A better reading here is οὔπω instead of πῶς οὐ. Therefore the words should run, Do ye not yet understand? It is as though our Lord said, \"You ought to have perceived, both from my words and from my actions, that I was not speaking concerning earthly leaven or earthly bread, but concerning spiritual doctrine.\" St. Matthew here (Matthew 16:12) is careful to tell us that this reproof of Christ quickened their intellects, and forced them to understand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - This miracle is recorded by St. Mark alone. And he cometh to Bethsaida. A better reading is ἔρχονται for ἔρχεται, they come unto Bethsaida. Which Beth-saida? It seems most probable that it was Bethsaida Julias. This Bethsaida was in the tetrarchy of Philip, who improved and adorned it, and named it Julias, in honor of the emperor's daughter Julia. A reference to Ver. 27 seems to make it quite clear that it must have been this Bethsaida, and not the Galilean Bethsaida on the other side of the lake. It is not surprising that there should have been, adjoining this great lake, more than one place called Beth-saida, i.e. the \"place of fish.\" And they bring a blind man unto him, and besought (παρακαλοῦσιν) - literally, beseech - him to touch him. St. Mark is fond of the graphic present. There is here, as at Mark 7:32, something almost like dictating the mode of cure. They seem to have imagined that the healing virtue could not go forth from Christ except by actual contact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And he took (ἐπιλαβόμενος) - literally, took hold of - the blind man by the hand, and led him - this is the rendering of ἐξήγαγεν; but a great weight of manuscript authority points to ἐξήνεγκεν as the better reading, brought him - out of the village (ἔξω τῆς κώμης). This Bethsaida was a village; but Philip had raised it to the rank of a city (πόλις), though it still seems to have retained its old appellation. Our Lord \"led\" or \"brought\" the blind man out of Beth-saida, for the same reason that he led the deaf and dumb man (Mark 7:33) away from the multitude:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) for the sake of prayer, that he might collect his mind, and unite himself more closely to God, and pray more intently and earnestly;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he might shun vain-glory and human praise, and teach us to shun it also. And when he had spit on his eyes - this act had a mystical meaning; it was the instrument by which his Deity operated - and laid his hands upon him, he asked him, Seest thou aught? Here were three acts -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the spitting,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the laying of the hands on him,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the questioning of him.NEWLINENEWLINEWe gather from ver. 25 that our Lord's hands were applied to the blind man's eyes. From the analogy of the miracle in the last chapter (Mark 7:33), we may perhaps infer that our Lord touched the man's eyes with saliva on his finger, and that the hands were withdrawn before he asked him if he saw aught.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. He looked ups natural action. He instinctively looked in the direction of the source of light. The words in the Greek of the next clause are as follows: - βλέπω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ὅτι ὡς δένδρα ὁρῶ περιπατοῦντας: I see men; for I behold them as trees, walking; that is, \"I see something confusedly and obscurely, not clearly; for I see what I think must be men, and yet so dimly that they look to me like trees, only that I know that men move from their places, whereas trees do not.\" The word \"walking\" refers to the men, and not to the trees, as is evident from the Greek. This man, as yet partially blind, saw men as in shadow, magnified by the mist, looking much larger than they really were.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes, and made him look up - this is the Authorized Version rendering of ἐποίησεν αὐτον ἀναβλέψαι: but the better authenticated reading is simply καὶ διέβλεψε, and he looked steadfastly - and was restored, and saw all things clearly. Now, here it pleased our Lord, not suddenly, but by degrees, to give perfect sight to this blind man. And this he didNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that he might give examples of different kinds of miracles, showing that\" there are differences of operations,\" and that he, as sovereign Lord, was not absolutely tied to any one particular method of working; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he might administer his power in increasing measures, as the faith of the recipient waxed stronger; that so he might gradually kindle greater hope and desire in him. It may be that the spiritual condition of this blind man was one which specially needed this gradual method of treatment. Our Lord was a wise and skillful Physician. At first he healed him in part, as one who imperfectly believed; that he who as yet saw little with a little sight, might believe more perfectly, and so be healed at last more perfectly; and thus by this miracle Christ teaches us that for the most part the unbeliever and the sinner is by degrees illuminated by God, so as to advance step by step in the knowledge and worship of God. \"By this miracle,\" says Bede, \"Christ teaches us how great is the spiritual blindness of man, which only by degrees, and by successive stages, can come to the light of Divine knowledge.\" The experiences of this blind man in gradually recovering his eyesight show as in a parable the stages of the spiritual change from absolute darkness to glimmering light, and thence to bright and clear vision. Cornelius a Lapide says, \"We see an example of this in children and scholars, who must be taught and instructed by degrees. Otherwise, if the master, impatient of delay and labour, seeks to deliver all things to them at once, he will overwhelm their mind and their memory, so that they will take in nothing; as wine, when it is poured into a narrow-necked vessel, if you attempt to pour in the whole at once, scarcely any will enter, but almost all is wasted.\" A Lapide adds the well-known Italian proverb, \"Piano, piano, siva lontano.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - This verse, according to the best reading, runs thus: And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village. It thus appears that Bethsaida was not the home of this blind man. He might naturally have wished to exhibit himself in Bethsaida, where many must have known him, and to have sung the praises of his great Benefactor. But this was far from what Christ wished. He wished to be in seclusion. He had no desire to excite more than could be helped the idle curiosity of the multitude. His miracles were for the sake of his doctrine, and not his doctrine for the sake of his miracles. The whole character of his administration was retiring and gentle. \"My doctrine shall distil as the dew.\" \"He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any hear his voice in the streets.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. This verse seems to corroborate the view that the Bethsaida just referred to was Bethsaida Julias. Caesarea Philippi lies at the roots of Libanus. Cornelius a Lapide says that it was originally celled Dan, the place where two little streams united, namely, Jeor and Daniel These two streamlets so united make the Jordan, whence the name Jeer-Dan, or Jordan. But since Pan, the God of shepherds, was better known to the Gentiles than Dan, a Hebrew tribe, it was hence called by them \"Paneas.' It is celled Bahias at the present day. It lay at the extreme north, as Beersheba lay at the extreme south. Hence the phrase, \"from Dan even to Beersheba.\" On this account many neighboring Gentiles, especially the Phoenicians, flocked to this city, as is frequently the case with border towns. And so Christ visited this neighborhood, not only because it presented favorable opportunities to him for teaching Jews and Gentiles alike, but also that he might speak more freely than he could have done in Judaea concerning a Messiah, whom the Jews expected as their king. in Judaea itself, and especially in the neighborhood of Jerusalem, it would have been perilous to speak on such a subject; for the scribes would at once have accused him to the Roman power that he was seeking the kingdom. The student who wishes for further information respecting the site of Caesarea Philippi may consult with advantage Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine' (ch. 11, \"The Lake of Merom and the sources of the Jordan\" ). A more familiar derivation of the Jordan than that given by A Lapide is that of the \"descender,\" from Jarad, \"to descend.\" Our Lord went from Bethsaida Julias directly northwards towards Paneas, named by Philip the Tetrach Caesarea Philippi, to distinguish it from the other Caesarea in Samaria on the Mediterranean coast. It will be observed that he went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi, avoiding the city itself. In the way thither he asked his disciples,... Who do men say that I am? This incident is mentioned also by St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Luke (Luke 9:18) says that he was alone praying, his disciples being doubtless not far off. According to this evangelist, our Lord says, \"Who do the multitudes say that I am? \"thus distinguishing them more particularly from his own disciples. The common people among the Jews knew that not long after the Babylonish Captivity the gift of prophecy had ceased amongst their nation. So they thought that Christ was not a new Prophet, but one of the old. They could not but see in him the renewal of the powers of the old prophets, their miracles and their teaching; but there were very few of them who believed that he was the Messiah. The great body of them were offended at his poverty and humility; for they thought that Messiah would appear amongst them with royal state as a temporal king. So that when some said, moved it might be by the sight of his miracles, \"This is that Prophet that should come into the world,\" they did but give utterance to a momentary and fugitive feeling, and not a firm or abiding conviction. The mass of mankind are fickle, easily led to change their opinions. Perhaps some of the Jewish multitude thought that the soul of one of the ancient prophets had entered into Christ, according to the Pythagorean notion of the transmigration of souls; or perhaps they thought that one of the old prophets had risen again in the person of Jesus. For though the Sadducees denied a resurrection, the great body of the Jews believed in it. Some thought that Christ was John the Baptist, because he resembled the Baptist in age (there was only six months difference in ago between them), as he also resembled him in holiness and in fervor of preaching. It was but a short time before, that John the Baptist had been put to death by Herod. His character and actions were fresh in their memories; and Herod himself had given currency to the idea that the Baptist had risen again in the person of our Lord. Then there was Elijah. Some thought that our Lord was Elijah, because it was known that Elijah had not died, and because there was an expectation, founded on Malachi's prophecy (Malachi 4:5), that he would return. They thought, therefore, that Elijah had returned, and that our Lord was Elijah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - By this second putting of the question, our Lord warned his disciples that they who had been better instructed ought to think greater things of him than these. It was necessary that he should show them that these current opinions and floating notions were far below his real claims. Therefore he says with emphasis, But who say ye that I am? - ye, my disciples, who, being always with me, have seen me do far greater things than they; ye, who have listened to my teaching, confirmed as it has been by those miracles; ye, who yourselves also have been enabled to work many miracles in my name; - who say ye that I am? Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. St. Peter here spoke as the mouthpiece of the rest. The suddenness and terseness of the answer is eminently characteristic of St. Peter. In St. Matthew's narrative it is given a little more in full, \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" But the strength of the answer really lies in St. Mark's words, \"Thou art the Christ,\" that is, the promised Messiah. What, however, St. Mark does omit here - a circumstance not to be passed without notice - is the great blessing pronounced by our Lord upon St. Peter (Matthew 16:17-19) as the reward of his confession. The explanation of this omission is to be found in the fact that this Gospel is really for the most part St. Peter's Gospel, recorded by St. Mark. It has already been observed, that, as far as it is possible to do so, considering Peter's prominent position amongst the other apostles, he retires into the background. It was necessary that it should be recorded that he made the good confession of our Lord as the Messiah; but beyond this the evangelist suppresses all mention of the distinction subsequently conferred upon him, although the rebuke which he afterwards received is recorded in full. It is, moreover, a significant circumstance (noticed in the 'Speaker's Commentary') that this Gospel was written at Rome, and in the first instance for Roman readers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he charged them that they should tell no man of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And he charged them (επετίμησεν) - a strong word, implying almost rebuke, he strictly charged them - that they should tell no man of him. Why was this? There were many reasons for this reticence. The state of parties in Palestine was most inexpedient for such a disclosure at that time. Those who were favorable to his cause would have wanted at once to take him by force and make him a king. In fact, some of them made no secret of their intentions (John 6:15). Those, on the other hand, who were opposed to him were only watching their opportunity to destroy him. Moreover, his own disciples had yet many things to learn; and besides all this, faith in his Godhead would be easier when his death should have been followed by his glorious resurrection and ascension.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, etc. In St. Matthew's narrative he says (Matthew 16:21), \"From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples,\" etc. - from the time, that is, of this great confession; from the time when he had openly acknowledged to his disciples the truth of his essential Divinity; from that time he began to instruct them as to his passion and his death. There are two great principles of faith, namely,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the Divinity and the humanity of Christ, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) his cross and passion, whereby he has redeemed the world.NEWLINENEWLINEAnd it was necessary that the disciples should be thus instructed in his amazing dignity as the Son of God, lest, when they saw him put to death, they might doubt as to his Godhead. And after three days rise again. St. Matthew and St. Luke say, \"on the third day\" - the day of his death counting for one, and the day of his resurrection for another, with one clear day intervening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And he spake the saying openly (παῥῤησία); literally, without reserve. This sudden announcement excited St. Peter. It was a new and startling communication. Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. The word προσλαβόμενος indicates that he \"took hold of him,\" to lead him apart, as though to have the opportunity of warning him with the greater familiarity and secrecy. So say St. Chrysostom and others. Peter would not have his own confession of Christ thus evacuated, as it were; nor does he think it possible that the Son of God could be slain. So he takes him apart, lest he should seem to reprove him in the presence of the other disciples; and then he says (Matthew 16:22), \"Mercy on thee, Lord (ἵλεώς σοι Κύριε): this shall never be unto thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter. The words indicate a sudden movement (ὁ δὲ ἐπιστραφεὶς), accompanied by a keen searching look at his disciples. Then he singles out Peter, and addresses to him, in their presence, the severe rebuke, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not (οὐ φρονεῖς) - literally, thou mindest not -the things of God, but the things of men. The form of words is the same as that used by our Lord to Satan himself, when he was tempted by him in the wilderness. It reminded him of that great conflict. The visions of worldly glory again floated before him. The crown without the cross was again held out to him. This explains his language. Peter was indeed rebuked; but the rebuke was aimed through him at the arch adversary who was addressing him through Peter. Here is the striking significance of his \"turning about.\" Peter was for the moment doing the tempter's work, and in \"turning about\" our Lord was again putting Satan behind him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He called unto him the multitude with his disciples. This shows that there was an interval between what had just taken place and what is now recorded. Our Lord now, without any further special reference to St. Peter, delivers a lesson of universal application; although, no doubt, he had Peter in his mind. If any man would (εἴ τις θέλει) come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. This self-denial ought to extend to everything, even to life itself, which we ought to be willing to resign, if need be, for the sake of Christ. Take up his cross. It is as though he said, \"Let him take up his cross, as I have borne my cross, that I might be the standard-bearer and Leader of all cross-bearers - I, who carried the cross on which I was to be crucified to the mount of Calvary.\" St. Luke (Luke 9:23) adds the words (καθ ἡμέραν), \"daily:\" \"let him take up his cross daily;\" thus showing that \"every day,\" and often \"at every hour,\" something occurs which it becomes us to bear patiently and bravely, and so on continually through our whole life. He takes up his cross who is crucified to the world. But he to whom the world is crucified follows his crucified Lord. This cross assumes various forms; such as persecution and martyrdom, affliction and sorrow of whatever kind, appointed by God; temptations of Satan, permitted by God for our trial, to increase our humility and virtue, and to make brighter our crown.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Because the cross is sharp and afflicting, our Lord animates his followers to bear it by the thought of its great and everlasting rewards. The meaning of the verse is this: he who by trying to shun the cross and to escape self-denial would save his life here, will lose it hereafter. But he who loses his life here for the sake of Christ, either by dying in his cause or by denying and mortifying his lusts out of love for him, he in the life to come shall find his life in the bosom of Christ and in eternal joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - What doth it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? (ζημιωθῆναι); literally, forfeit his life (ψυχή). The word ψυχή in the Greek, originally meaning simply \"breath,\" as the sign of life, is of very comprehensive import, embracing not merely \"the breath of life,\" but also the \"soul,\" or immortal part of man, as distinguished from his mortal body, also the mind or understanding, as the organ of thought. \"Life\" seems here to be the best English synonym, as being, like the Greek ψυχή, the more comprehensive term.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - In exchange (ἀντάλλαγμα) for his life. The Greek term here means an \"equivalent,\" \"a compensation.\" The\" life,\" in its largest sense and meaning, defies all comparison, surpasses all value. It has been bought and redeemed with the precious blood of Christ; therefore the whole world would be a poor price for the soul of one man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark8:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Our Lord here looks onward to the day of judgment. Whosoever shall be ashamed of me. \"Whosoever:\" the word includes all, whatever their position or circumstances may be. \"Shall be ashamed of me;\" that is, shall deny my faith, or blush to confess me here. Of him shall the Son of man be ashamed; that is, Christ will despise him, when he shall appear with power and great glory, in that sublime majesty which he gained by his death upon the cross. In this adulterous and sinful generation. It adds to the disgrace of being ashamed of Christ that the shame is manifested in the presence of the base and the worthless; and therefore our Lord exhibits the contrast between the mean and contemptible people in the presence of whom men are ashamed of him here, and the magnificent assemblage in whose presence he will be ashamed of them hereafter. The cross of Christ appeared to the great body of mankind to be shameful and contemptible. To the Jews it was a stumbling-block, and to the Greek's foolishness. Hence vast numbers, whether through shame or fear, did not dare to confess it, and still less to preach it. And therefore it is that St. Paul says (Romans 1:l6), \"I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Mark.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Till they see the kingdom of God come with power. In St. Matthew 16:28 the words run thus: \"Till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.\" In St. Luke 9:27, \"Till they see the kingdom of God.\" All these evangelists connect their record of the Transfiguration with these predictive words - a circumstance which must not be lost sight of in their interpretation. The question, therefore, is whether or how far the Transfiguration is to be regarded as a fulfillment of these words. One thing seems plain, that the Transfiguration, if a fulfillment at all, was not an exhaustive fulfillment of the words. The solemnity of their introduction forbids us to limit them to an event which would happen within eight days of their utterance. But there was an event impending, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, involving the overthrow of the Jewish polity, which, coming as it did within forty or fifty years of the time when our Lord uttered these words, might reasonably have been expected to take place within the lifetime of some of those then standing there. And that great catastrophe was frequently alluded to by our Lord as a type and earnest of the great judgment at the end of the world. What relation, then, did the Transfiguration hold to these two events and to the prediction contained in this verse? It was surely a prelude and pledge of what should be hereafter, specially designed to brace and strengthen the apostles for the sight of the sufferings of their Master, and to animate them to endure the toil and the trials of the Christian life. So that the Transfiguration was an event, so to speak, parenthetic to this prediction - a preliminary manifestation, for the special advantage of those who witnessed it; though given also \"for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\" Such were the views of St. Hilary, St. Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, and others. \"When our Lord was transfigured,\" says St. Jerome, \"he did not lose his form and aspect, but he appeared to his apostles as he will appear at the day of judgment.\" And elsewhere he says, \"Go forth a little out of your prison, and place before your eyes the reward of your present labor, Which 'the eye hath not seen, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man.'\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - After six days. St. Luke 9:28 says, \"About eight days after these sayings.\" There is no real discrepancy here. There were six whole days that intervened between our Lord's words and the Transfiguration itself. Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John. He chose these three, as the leaders amongst the disciples, and he showed to them his glory, because he intended also to show them afterwards his bitter agony in the garden. This magnificent splendor - this \"excellent glory,\" as 2 Peter 1:17 describes it - this, together with the voice of the Father,\" This is my beloved Son,\" would assure them that Christ was truly God, but that his essential Deity was hidden by the veil of the flesh; and that, although he was about to be crucified and slain, yet his Godhead could not suffer or die. It was an evidence beforehand, a prospective evidence, that he underwent death, even the death of the cross, not constrained by infirmity or necessity, but of his own will, for the redemption of man. It was plain that, since he could thus invest his body with this Divine glory, he could have saved himself from death if he had so willed. He taketh with him Peter, and James, and John. St. Peter's reference to the transfiguration (just alluded to) shows what a deep and abiding impression it made on his mind. St. James, too, was there, as one who was to be amongst the first to die for his sake. St. John also was with them, who, having seen the glory of the Son of God, which is subject to no limits of time, might be bold to send forth his grand testimony, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" And bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves. \"It is necessary for all,\" says Remigius, \"who desire to contemplate God, that they should not grovel amidst low thoughts and desires, but ever be lifted up to heavenly things. And thus our Lord was teaching his disciples that they must not look for the brightness of the Divine glory in the depths of this world, but in the kingdom of heavenly blessedness. And he leads them apart, because holy men are in intention and desire separated from evil, as they will be altogether separated from it in the world to come. For they who look for the glories of the resurrection ought now in heart and mind to dwell on high, and to seek these glories by continual prayer.\" Into a high mountain. A tradition of the time of Jerome identifies this mountain with Tabor, in Galilee. But there are two weighty objections to this view:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that our Lord was at this time in the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi, a considerable distance from Tabor, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that there is strong reason for believing that Tabor had at this time a fortress on its summit. It must be remembered that Caesarea Philippi was at the foot of Libanus; and the spurs of Libanus would present several eminences answering to the description, \"a high mountain (ὄρος ὑψηλὸν).\" The Mount of Transfiguration was in all probability Hermon, a position of extreme grandeur and beauty, its snowy peaks overlooking the whole extent of Palestine. \"High up,\" says Dean Stanley, \"on its southern slopes there must be many a point where the disciples could be taken 'apart by themselves.' Even the transient comparison of the celestial splendor with the snow, where alone it could be seen in Palestine, should not, perhaps, be wholly overlooked. At any rate, the remote heights above the sources of the Jordan witnessed the moment when, his work in his own peculiar sphere being ended, he set his face for the last time to go up to Jerusalem.\" Although compelled to dismiss from our minds the old tradition of Tabor as the scene of the Transfiguration, we still think of that mountain as near to Nazareth, where our Lord was brought up; and of Hermon, where he was transfigured, as we rejoice in the fulfillment of the old prophecy, \"Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy Name.\" And he was transfigured (μετεμορφώθη) before them. The fashion of his appearance was changed. It was no illusion, no imaginary appearance, but a real transformation. It was the Divine glory within him manifesting itself through his humanity; and yet not that glory of Deity which no man hath seen or can see; but such a manifestation that the disciples might in some degree behold the glory and majesty, of Deity through the veil of his flesh. Nor, we may believe, did our Lord in his transfiguration change the essence or form of his countenance. But he assumed a mighty splendor, so that, as St. Matthew 17:2 tells us, \"his face did shine as the sun.\" This splendor was not in the air, nor in the eyes of the disciples, but in the person of the Son of God - a splendor which communicated itself to his raiment, so that his garments became glistering (στίλβοντα), exceeding white; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. This figure is taken from natural things. The first idea of \"fuller\" from the Latin fullo, is that of one who cleanses by \"stamping with the feet.\" His business is to restore the soiled cloth to its natural whiteness. The evangelist uses an earthly thing to represent the heavenly. The heavenly Fuller gives a purity and a brightness infinitely exceeding the power of any \"fuller on earth.\" It would almost seem as if the figure was one specially supplied by St. Peter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses. Moses and Elijah were there because Moses was the lawgiver of the old covenant, and Elijah was conspicuous among the prophets; so that they were the representatives, the one of the Law, and the other of the \"goodly fellowship of the prophets. They appear together to bear witness to Christ as the true Messiah, the Savior of the world, prefigured in the Law, and foretold by the prophets. They appear to bear witness to him, and then to resign their offices to the great Lawgiver and Prophet whom they foreshadowed. Then, further, Moses died, but Elijah was translated. Moses, therefore, represents the dead saints who shall rise from their graves and come forth at his coming, while Elijah represents those who shall be found alive at his advent. Our Lord brought with him, at his transfiguration, Moses who had died, and Elijah who had been translated, that he might show his power over both \"the quick and the dead.\" St. Luke 9:31 says that Moses and Elijah \"appeared in glory, and spake of his decease (τὴν ἔξοδον αὐτοῦ) which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.\" They appeared in glory; the Divine splendor irradiated them. They \"spake of his decease,\" literally, his departure - his departure not only out of Jerusalem, but out of this life, by his death upon the cross. The death of Christ was thus shown to be the ultimate end to which the Law and the prophets pointed. Even in that hour of his glory, on the Mount of Transfiguration, this was their theme; and thus the disciples were nerved to look with hope and faith to that which they had contemplated with dismay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Peter answereth, and saith to Jesus. We learn from St. Luke 9:33 that this happened just as Moses and Elijah were departing. Peter was excited, and there was fear mingled with his excitement. He was bewildered. His first idea was to seek that they might remain, for he saw that they were just preparing to depart. Theophylact says upon this, \"Do not say with Peter, 'It is good for us to be here;' for it behoves us ever, whilst in the flesh, to be advancing, and not to remain in one stage of virtue and contemplation, but to pass on to other degrees\" It is, perhaps, too curious a question to ask how the three disciples knew them to be Moses and Elijah. The same Divine power which presented them with a vision of the other world gave them an intuitive knowledge on the subject. And we may, perhaps, infer from hence that in that world to come there will be not only recognition, but knowledge, at once imparted, of those whose faces we have not seen \"in the flesh.\" St. Luke 9:32 says that Peter and his companions \"were heavy with sleep (βεβαρημένοι ὕπνῳ).\" It is probable that the Transfiguration took place at night. The whole manifestation would be rendered more conspicuous and striking amidst the darkness and stillness of night. But St. Luke is careful to add, \"when they were fully awake (διαγρηγορήσαντες).\" This word might be rendered, \"having remained awake.\" But whichever translation be adopted, the intention of the evangelist is evidently to show that it was not in a dream or a vision of the night that they saw this. It was a great reality, on which they looked with open eyes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They became sore afraid. There is a slight change of reading here. Instead of ῆσαν γὰρ ἔκφοβοι the best authorities give ἔκφοβοι γὰρ ἐγένοντο. A sense of great awe and terror overpowered the bliss and brightness of the scene. All the revelations of the other world strike terror, even though abated as this manifestation was by the presence of their dear Lord and Savior.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There came a cloud overshadowing them. The cloud enfolded them all, so that they could not be seen, it was so ample and dense, and yet so bright and shining. St. Matthew (Matthew 17:5) says it was \"a ought cloud. The cloud was a symbol of the grandeur and unapproachable glory of God. The disciples were admitted within this cloud that they might have a foretaste of future glory, and that they might be witnesses of what took place under the cloud, and especially that they might be able to give evidence throughout all ages of the voice which they heard come out of the cloud from \"the excellent glory\" (the expression is equivalent to the Hebrew \"Shechinah,\" and St. Peter says (2 Peter 1:18), it came from heaven), This is my beloved Son: hear ye him. But at the same time that this cloud was the symbol, it was also the veil of Deity, of the glory of Deity. \"He maketh the clouds his chariot,\" says the psalmist (Psalm 104:3). Moreover, the cloud abated and subdued the splendor of Christ's appearance, which otherwise the mortal eyes of the disciples could not have borne. It will be observed that St. Mark omits the words, found in St. Matthew (Matthew 17:5),\" in whom I am well pleased.\" So does St. Luke. But it is remarkable that they are found in St. Peter (2 Peter 1:17); from whence we might have expected to find them here. In St. Luke (Luke 9:35) the most approved readings give, \"This is my Son, my chosen (ἐκλελεγμένος).\" The words, \"my beloved Son,\" are impressed upon us in order that epithets so sweet and endearing might kindle our love and devotion. \"Hear ye him\" - not Moses, who has now departed, but Christ himself, the new Author of a new Law. \"Hear ye him\" was not said when our Lord was baptized, because he was then only just proclaimed to the world. But now these words signify the abolition of the old dispensation, and the establishment of the new covenant in Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save Jesus only with themselves. St. Matthew here says (Matthew 17:6), \"When the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sere afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.\" St. Mark omits this; but in his characteristic manner states that which implies what St. Matthew has recorded. It was the \"touch\" of Jesus that caused them to look round about; and then in a moment they perceived that they were alone with Jesus, as they were before this manifestation began. The order of incidents in the Transfiguration appears to have been this: Our Lord is praying. The disciples, fatigued with the ascent of the mountain, are heavy with sleep; and Christ is transfigured. Then appear Moses and Elijah; and they are talking with Jesus about his exodus - his decease to be accomplished at Jerusalem. The disciples mused from their sleep by the supernatural brightness, and by the conversation, and now, fully awake, behold the glory of Jesus, and Hoses and Elijah talking with him. As Moses and Elijah are preparing for their departure, Peter, excited, enchanted, bewildered, and yet grieved to see that they were going, seeks to detain them by the proposal to make some temporary resting-place for them. Then comes the bright overshadowing cloud, and a voice out of the cloud, \"This is my beloved Son: hear ye him.\" At the sound of this voice the disciples fall terrified to the earth. But they are soon comforted by Christ, and, looking up, they see him alone with themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead. They were not even to tell their fellow-disciples, lest it might cause vexation or envy that they had not been thus favored. The time of our Lord's resurrection would be a fitting opportunity for revealing this mystery; and then the disciples would understand and believe it, when, after his passion and death, which were an offense to them, they should see him rising in glory, of which event the Transfiguration was a type. For, by the Resurrection they would certainly know that Christ underwent the death of the cross, not by constraint, but of his own accord, and out of his great love for us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean; that is, his own rising from the dead, of which our Lord had just been speaking. No doubt the general resurrection at the end of the world was an article of faith with which the disciples were familiar. But they could not understand, when he spake of his own immediate rising from the dead. So their perplexities led them at last to ask him the question; or rather to make the remark to him, The scribes say that Elijah must first come; with a view to obtaining some clearer understanding. They had just seen Elijah in the Transfiguration, and they had seen him disappear. They wondered why he should have departed. They thought, it may be, that he ought to have remained, that he might be the forerunner of Christ and of his kingdom and glory, according to the prophecy of Malachi (Malachi 4:6). This the scribes taught; but they erred in the confusion of times, for they did not distinguish the first coming of Christ in the flesh from his second advent to judgment. The thought upon the mind of the disciples appears to have been this: They heard Christ speak of his own resurrection as close at hand, and they had seen the type of it in his transfiguration; and they thought that immediately after that, Christ's kingdom would come, and he would reign gloriously. Why, then, had not Elijah remained, that he might be his precursor? St. Matthew (Matthew 17:13) tells us that our Lord's words which follow showed the disciples that when he said that Elijah was to come first and restore all things, he meant them to understand\" that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.\" Upon the question of a future coming of Elijah, it seems safest to confess our ignorance. The prophecy of Malachi was no doubt in part fulfilled in the coming of John the Baptist; but it would be rash to affirm that it may not receive another and more literal fulfillment before the second advent. A host of ancient Christian expositors have held that Elijah will appear in person before the second advent of Christ. St. Augustine, in his 'City of God' (20:29), says, \"Not without reason do we hope that before the coming of our Judge and Savior Elias will come, because we have good reason to believe that he is now alive; for, as Holy Scripture distinctly informs us, he gas taken up from this life in a chariot of fire. When, therefore, he is come he shall give a spiritual explanation of the Law which the Jews at present understand carnally, and will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the fathers; that is, the Jews who are the children will understand the Law in the same sense as their fathers the prophets understood it.\" Indeed, this is one of the principal reasons assigned by the Fathers for this appearance of Elijah, that he may convert the Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And when he earns to his disciples, he saw a great crowd around them. High authorities support the reading adopted by the Revisers, when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them. \"They\" would thus mean our Lord and the three chosen disciples who had been with him on the Mount of Transfiguration. \"They\" came to the other disciples who had been left below. St. Luke (Luke 9:37) adds \"On the next day, when they were come down from the mountain.\" This would seem to confirm the supposition that the transfiguration took place in the night. All the synoptists agree in placing the following immediately after the transfiguration. Scribes were questioning with the disciples who had bee left behind. As they had assembled in the neigh-where Jesus was, for the purpose of watching him. Their object in questioning with the disciples was doubtless to throw discredit upon Jesus, because they, disciples, had failed to work the miracle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The multitude were favourably towards Jesus, and were glad that returned at an opportune moment to defend his disciples against the scribes. But why were they greatly amazed? The word in the Greek is ἐξεθαμβήθη. It seems most probable that they saw in his countenance, always heavenly and majestic, something even yet more Divine, retaining some traces of the glory of his transfiguration, even as the face of Moses shone when he came down from the mount (Exodus 34:29). It hardly seems likely that the amazement of the people was simply caused by our Lord having arrived at an opportune time to relieve his disciples of their difficulty. The Greek word expresses something more than would be satisfied by the fact of our Lord having come upon the scene just when he was wanted. Even if there were no remains of the transfiguration glory upon his countenance, the vivid recollection of the scene, of the conversation with Moses and Elijah, and the subject of it, and the voice of the Father, must have invested his countenance with a peculiar majesty and dignity. The same word, though without its compound (ἐθαμβοῦντο), is used further on in Mark 10:32 to express the amazement of the disciples, as he pressed eagerly onwards before them on his way to Jerusalem and to his cross. There was no doubt something then in his countenance which astonished them. The multitude running to him, saluted him. The scribes had not been able to shake their faith. In their view he was still \"that Prophet that should come into the world.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And he asked them; that is, the multitude. The context shows this. The reading here is αὐτούς, not τοὺς γραμματεῖς.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - One of the multitude answered him, Master I brought - the Greek is ἤνεγκα - unto thee my son. He brought his son, expecting to find Jesus; but failing in this, he applied to our Lord's disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they could not. St. Matthew (Matthew 17:14) says that the man came kneeling to Christ, \"and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic.\" The word in the Greek there is σεληνιάζεται. Etymologically, no doubt, \"lunatic\" conveys the meaning of the word most nearly. But the graphic description here of St. Mark corresponds exactly to epilepsy, and to epilepsy acted upon by an unclean spirit, who in this instance deprived the sufferer of his speech. Lunatics were so called from the prevailing impression, not without foundation, that the light and the changes of the moon have an influence upon the body, and so act through the body upon the mind. This influence seems to be recognized in Psalm 121:6, \"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Wheresoever it taketh him (καταλάβη); literally, it seizeth hold of him. This is the Greek word from which comes our \"catalepsy,\" the active form of \"epilepsy.\" It teareth him (ῤήσσει). This is doubtless the literal meaning. But there is much evidence to show that it means here \"it striketh or throweth him down.\" This is the reudering of the Peshito Syriac, and of the Vulgate. The same interpretation is also given by Hesychius as one of the meanings of the word. St. Luke (Luke 9:39) describes the symptoms thus: \"A spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him (σπαράσσει αὐτὸν) that he foameth (μετὰ ἀφροῦ), and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.\" This it will be remembered is the record of one who was himself a physician. He grindeth his teeth, and pineth away (ξηραίνεται), as though the springs of his life were dried up. The father of the boy is here minutely describing the symptoms when the fit was upon him. He seems here to express the stiffness and rigidity of the body in the approaches of the malady. And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able. They had tried and failed. This failure is attributed by our Lord (see Matthew 17:20) to their want of faith; or rather to their \"little faith (διὰ τὴν ὀλιγοπιστίαν ὑμῶν).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - O faithless generation. These words were no doubt intended primarily as a rebuke to the Jews and their scribes; though not without a glance at the weakness of faith of his own disciples. The words are the complaint of one weary of the unbelief of the masses and of the weakness of faith in even his own. Bring him unto me (φέρετε); literally, Bring ye him to me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And they brought him unto him. The father, it would seem, was not able of himself to bring him, so fierce and violent were the paroxysms of the disorder. And when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him (συνεσπέραξεν) - it might be rendered, convulsed him - grievously. Observe the Greek construction (καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν τὸ πνεῦμα), masculine participle with neuter noun. The sight of Christ stirred the evil spirit dwelling in the child. He was irritated by the presence of Christ; for he knew his power, and feared lest he should be cast out. Then came the last and most violent convulsion. He wallowed foaming. The word \"to wallow\" is probably from the Latin volvo. He rolled about in his agony. St. Gregory, quoted by Trench ('Miracles,' p. 397), shows how true all this is to nature; and that \"the expulsion of a deadly evil from our spiritual being is not accomplished without a terrible struggle, followed in some cases by extreme prostration.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - Our Lord asks the father, not the sufferer, which in this case would have been useless - he was but a lad, and he was dumb. Our Lord's question, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? was intended, not of course for his own information, but to inspire the father with hope and confidence. The father briefly answers, From a child; and then turns to a description of the perils to which his child was continually exposed through these paroxysms. And then, half doubting, half in despair, he says, If thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us. It is as though he said, \"Thy disciples have failed, perhaps thy power may be greater.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - The most approved reading here is, not Αἴ δύνασαι πιστεῦσαι, but simply Αἴ δύνασαι, So that the English rendering is, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth. Our Lord takes up the father's words. It is as though he said, \"Thou sayest to me, 'If thou canst do anything!' Ah, that 'If thou canst!' All things are possible to him that believeth.\" In other words, our Lord said to him, \"Believe in me, and your child shall be healed.\" It was right that Christ should demand faith in himself; for it was not fitting that he should confer his special benefits on those who disbelieved or doubted about him - that he should thrust his blessings on those who were unworthy of them. The answer of the father is touching and beautiful. Greatly agitated, he cried out and said (we might well suppose (μετὰ δακρύων \"with tears,\" although the weight of evidence is against this addition being retained in the text), I believe; help thou mine unbelief. It is as though he said,\" I do believe; but my faith is weak. Do thou, therefore, increase and strengthen it; so that whatever there is in me of doubt or remaining unbelief may be taken away, and I may be counted worthy to obtain from thee this blessing for my son.\" Nor can we doubt that Christ heard a prayer so humble and so fervent, and took away from him the last remains of doubt and unbelief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-29. - The multitude had been much excited by the dispute between the scribes and our Lord's disciples. And now, when they noticed that he had taken the father apart, as no doubt he had done, to question him they came running together (the word is ἐπισυντρέχει, an unusual word, meaning \"they ran together to the place\") where he was, crowding upon him. Then he came forward, and with a voice of sublime authority he said, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him and enter no more into him. The rest of the narrative shows how malignant and powerful this evil spirit was, who dared so to resist and defy Christ that, in his departure out of the afflicted boy, he almost robbed him of life. \"Most unwillingly,\" says Archbishop Trench, \"does the evil spirit depart, seeking to destroy that which he can no longer retain.\" And he quotes Fuller, who says that he is \"like an outgoing tenant, that cares not what mischief he does to the house that he is quitting.\" Some have supposed that this was an evil spirit possessed of more than ordinary power as well as malignity, and that this was the reason why our Lord's disciples could not cast him out; so that this expulsion needed the mighty arm of One stronger than the strong. The words in the Greek are powerful, severe, and authoritative: \"He rebuked (ἐπετίμησε) the unclean spirit, ... Thou dumb and deaf spirit (τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἄλαλον καὶ κωφὸν), I command thee (ἐγώ σοι ἐπιτάσσω), come out of him, and enter no more into him.\" This explains our Lord's words when the disciples remarked afterwards, We could not out it out... This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer; that is, this particular kind of malicious spirit. For there are different degrees of malice and energy in evil spirits as in evil men. The words \"and fasting\" are added in many ancient authorities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - This verse informs us that our Lord and his disciples now left the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi. Their route would be across the Jordan above the Sea of Galilee, and so by the usual track through Galilee down to Capernaum. Our Lord now wished for privacy, that he might farther instruct his disciples with regard to his sufferings and death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For he taught his disciples (ἐδίδασκε γὰρ τοὺς μαθητὰς αὑτοῦ); literally, for he was teaching (imperfect) his disciples. The Son of man is delivered (παραδίδοται) The whole is present to his mind, as though it were now taking place. And they shall kill him (ἀποκτενοῦσιν). This is a stronger form of κτείνω. And when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again (ἀναστήσεται); literally, he shall rise up. Our Lord repeats this prediction, in order that, when these events actually took place, his disciples might not be alarmed or offended, or abandon their faith in him, as though he could not be the Messiah because he underwent so terrible a death. It will be remembered that, notwithstanding these repeated warnings from their Lord, when these events actually took place, \"they all forsook him and fled.\" It was therefore necessary that this coming event of his crucifixion should be repeatedly impressed upon them, that they might thus be assured that he was willing to undergo this bitter death; that he was not going to his cross by constraint, but as a willing Sacrifice, that he might do the will of his Father, and so redeem mankind. Therefore he repeated all this in Galilee, when he returned from his transfiguration, and after he had cast out the evil spirit from the epileptic child, and so had gained to himself great renown. He would thus restrain the excited feelings of his disciples, and impress upon them the reasons for his journey to Jerusalem, and prepare them for the dread realities which were awaiting him there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - But they understood not the saying, and were afraid (ἐφοβοῦντο) to ask him; St. Matthew (Matthew 17:23) says, \"They were exceeding sorry.\" They saw that something very dreadful was about to happen. Their Master's words and looks showed them this. But it was a mystery to them. All his words staggered them, but especially those which spoke of his rising again. They did not understand whether it was an entrance into a higher state or a restoration to a common life. They did not understand why he was to die, and how these words of his about his death could agree with those in which he had told them that his kingdom was at hand. Perhaps, on the whole, they inclined to the view most pleasing to them, that Christ would not die; for this was what they wished and most desired. And so they tried to persuade themselves that his words respecting his sufferings and death had some other hidden meaning; and were to be understood in a figurative sense and not a literal. But anyhow, they dreaded to ask him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33, 34. - They have now reached Capernaum. And when he was in the house - the house, that is, which he frequented when staying in Capernaum - he asked them, What were ye reasoning in the way? The words \"among yourselves,\" of the Authorized Version, are not found in the best authorities. St. Matthew (Matthew 18:1) does not record this question of our Lord, which brings to light the fact that they had been disputing by the way which of them should be the greatest. The Greek is (τίς μείζων) who was greater, that is, than the rest. It has been well noticed that this passage, given in substance in all the synoptic Gospels, is a striking evidence of the truthfulness and impartiality of the disciples. This dispute of theirs might easily have been suppressed as scarcely creditable to them. But in writing the Gospels the evangelists thought more of what exalted the Savior than what abased themselves. This dispute of the disciples shows how thoroughly they realized the nearness of his kingdom, and at the same time how much they had yet to learn as to the qualifications necessary for admission to it. It is not unlikely that the preference given by our Lord to Peter, James, and John may have given occasion for his contention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And he sat down, and called the twelve. He sat down, with the authority of the great Teacher, to inculcate solemnly a fundamental principle of the Christian life. If any man would be first he shall be last of all, and minister of all. These words are capable of two interpretations. They might be regarded as analogous to our Lord's words elsewhere, \"He that exalteth himself shall be abased;\" as though they indicated the penalty which attaches to unworthy ambition. But it is surely far more natural to regard them as pointing out the way to real greatness, namely, by humble service for Christ's sake.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And he took a little child (παιδίον), and set him in the midst of them. St. Mark adds, what is not recorded by the other synoptists, that he took him in his arms. And taking him in his arms (ἐναγκαλισάμενος); literally, folding him in his arms; embracing him. It is probable that the house where he was was the house of Simon Peter; and it is possible that this little child might have been Simon's. A tradition not earlier than the ninth century says that this child was Ignatius.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me. Whosoever shall \"receive;\" that is, show him offices of kindness and charity. One of such little children; that is, such in simplicity, in innocence and humility, such as this little child is in age and stature. In my Name, that is, with special regard to my Name. He thus seems to link all that is good and beautiful with his Name; as all that is really good and excellent in man is a reflection of his goodness. St. Luke (Luke 9:48) says, 'Whosoever shall receive this little child in my Name receiveth me.\" Our Lord, therefore, speaks first, literally of a little child, and secondly, in a mystical sense, of those who are like little children; making that little child in his arms the figure and type of all those who are like little children. The sense, therefore, of his words is this: \"Humility, which is the foundation and the measure of spiritual perfection, so pleases me that I delight in little children. And all who would be my disciples must become as little children, and so will they deserve to be received by all; for men will think that they receive me in them, because they receive them for my sake.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - This verse, according to the best authorities, should begin simply, John said unto him - although in St. Luke (Luke 9:49) they stand, \"And John answered and said\" - Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name: and we forbade him, because he followed not us. The casting out of evil spirits was one of the foremost signs of apostleship; and what surprised St. John was that one who followed not Christ should have been able to work this miracle - a miracle in which, it will be remembered, the disciples had recently failed. It thus appears that our Lord's teaching had been so influential, that some, not reckoned amongst his disciples, had shown this proof of a strong and overpowering faith. We know that there were those in our Savior's time, of Jewish race, who cast out devils (Matthew 12:27). And Justin Martyr, in his 'Dialogue with Trypho the Jew,' states that while exorcism, as practiced by the Jews, often failed when it was attempted to be exercised \"by the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\" was eminently successful when administered \"by the name of the Son of God, who was born of a virgin and crucified under Pontius Pilate\" (c. 85). That spirit has power over spirit in many mysterious ways is one of those truths which science has not yet been able to explain (see Dr. Morison on St. Mark, in loc.). To return, however, to the instance here alluded to by St. John, it should be observed that they who acted thus had faith in Christ; and that by thus acting with him and for him, though not amongst his recognized followers, they contributed towards his honor who, by means of these imperfect instruments, carried out the great purpose of his manifestation, namely,\" to destroy the works of the devil.\" Then further, the disciples forbade them not out of envy or hatred, but out of zeal for Christ, as though they were thus serving his cause and upholding his honor. But this was\" a zeal, not according to knowledge.\" They had forbidden them, without having first taken counsel of their Master.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - But Jesus said, Forbid him not. It is as though our Lord said, \"Do not forbid him; do not hinder him from a good work - a work which does honor to me and to my cause; because, although he does not actually follow me as you do, he is nevertheless engaged in the same cause; he is celebrating my Name by the casting out of evil spirits. Therefore he is not opposing my Name; on the contrary, he is publishing and recommending it.\" Here is a warning against that exclusive spirit, which is eager for its own ends rather than for Christ's glory, and would limit the exercise of his gifts and graces to its own system or school, instead of inquiring whether those whom it condemns are not working in Christ's name and for the promotion of his glory, although it may be allowable to think that in some instances they might find a more excellent way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he that is not against us is on our part.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - For he that is not against us is for us. In St. Matthew (Matthew 12:30) we find our Lord using a somewhat similar expression, only in an inverted order. He there says, \"He that is not with me is against me.\" The lesson which both these apothegms teach is the same, that there is no such thing as neutrality in reference to Christ and his cause. We must be either with him or against him. Dr. Morison on St. Mark in this place says, \"When in applied morals we sit in judgment on ourselves, we should in ordinary circumstances apply the law obversely and stringently,' he who is not with Christ is against him.' But when we are sitting in judgment on others, into whose hearts we cannot look directly, we should in ordinary circumstances apply the law reversely and generously, ' He that is not against Christ is with him.'\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - In my name, because ye belong to Christ. The reading adopted in the Revised Version is, ἐν ὀνόματι ὅτι χριστοῦ ἐστέ: literally, in name, that ye are Christ's; or, because ye are Christ's. The force of this observation seems to be this: \"If he who gives you a cup of water to drink in my Name, and out of regard for me, does well, and shall be rewarded of God, much more shall he be rewarded who casts out devils in my Name.\" The disciples are thus taught that it is contrary to the whole spirit of Christianity to disparage works of beneficence, or to suggest unworthy motives for them (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - This verse stands out as the severe antithesis to what has gone before. As he who receives and encourages Christ's little ones and those who are like little children and believe in him, receives him, and so shall receive from him the glorious rewards of Heaven; so, on the contrary, whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in Christ is guilty of deadly sin; and it were better for him if a great millstone (μύλος ὀνικός) - literally, a millstone so large as to require to be turned by an ass - were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - The hand, or the foot, or the eye represents any instrument by which sin may be committed; and it applies to those who may be the means of drawing us into sin. If your relative or your friend, who is useful or dear to you as your hand, your foot, or your eye, is drawing you into sin, cut him off from you, lest he should draw you into hell, into the unquenchable Gehenna. Gehenna, or the Valley of Hinnom, lay to the south of Jerusalem. Originally a pleasant suburb of the city, it became in later times the scene of the worship of Molech, \"the abomination of the children of Ammon.\" On this account the valley was polluted by King Josiah. It thus became the receptacle of everything that was vile and filthy. These noisome accumulations were from time to time consumed by fire; and the things which were not consumed by fire were the prey of worms. Hence \"Gehenna\" became the image of the place of eternal punishment, where \"the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.\" These terrible images are conclusive as to the eternity of future punishment, so far as our nature is concerned and our knowledge reaches. They are the symbols of certain dreadful realities; too dreadful for human language to describe or human thought to conceive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. These words are a quotation from Isaiah 66:24, and they are repeated three times in the Authorized Version. But the best ancient authorities omit them in the two first places, retaining them at ver. 48. The metaphor is very striking as well as awful. Ordinarily the worm feeds upon the disorganized body, and then dies. The fire consumes the fuel, and then itself expires. But here the worm never dies; the fire never goes out. The words of Cornelius a Lapide on the original passage in Isaiah are well worth recording here: \"I beseech you, O reader, by the mercies of our God, by your own salvation, by that one little life entrusted to you and committed to your care, that you will ever keep before your eyes the living memory, as of eternity and of eternal torments, so also of the eternal joys on the other side offered to you by God, and concerning which you here cast the die, and that irrevocable. Let these two things never depart from your mind. In this world, 'Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity.' Oh, what a void there is in earthly things! Oh, how vain is all our life without Christ! In the world to come, truth of truths, and all is truth; stability of stabilities, and all is stability; eternity of eternities, and all is eternity. An eternity in heaven most happy, in hell most miserable, ' Where their worm dies not, and the. fire is not quenched.'\" St. Bernard says \"the worm that never dies is the memory of the past, which never ceases to gnaw the conscience of the impenitent.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - For every one shall be salted with fire; and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. According to the most approved authorities, the second clause of this verse should be omitted, although it is evident that our Lord had in his mind the words in Leviticus it. 13, \"Every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt.\" Every one shall be salted with fire. \"Every one.\" The statement is general in its application. There is no limitation. The good and the evil alike shall be \"salted with fire.\" There is an apparent incongruity here. But it must be remembered that both the salt and the fire are here used in a metaphorical sense; and there is a fire which is penal, and there is a fire which purifies. In the case of the wicked the fire is penal; and the salting with fire in their case can only mean the anguish of a tormented conscience, which must be commensurate with its existence in the same moral condition. But there is a fire which purifies. St. Peter, addressing the Christians of the Dispersion (1 Peter 4:12), bids them not to think it strange concerning the \"fiery trial\" which was among them. This was their \"salting with fire.\" Those persecutions which they suffered were their discipline of affliction, through which God was purifying and preserving them. This discipline is necessary for all Christians. They must arm themselves with the same mind, even though they may not live in a time of outward persecution. He who parts with the hand, or the foot, or the eye; that is, he who surrenders what is dear to him - he who parts with what, if he was only to confer with flesh and blood, he would rather keep, for the sake of Christ, is going through the discipline of self-sacrifice, which is often painful and severe, but nevertheless purifying. He is salted with fire; but he is pro-served by the power of God through faith unto salvation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTMark9:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSalt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - Salt is good; that is, it is useful and beneficial. This is true of the literal salt. Its wholesome antiseptic properties are universally recognized. But our Lord has before his mind in this whole passage the spiritual meaning. He is thinking of the salt of Divine grace, of the salt of a spirit informed and influenced by the Holy Spirit. He had already told his disciples that they were \"the salt of the earth.\" Not, indeed, that they could deliver the earth from corruption - that was beyond their power. But when Christ had delivered it by his mighty sacrifice and the gift of his Spirit, it was their business, as it is the duty of all Christians, to keep it in a healthy state; so that by their wisdom and purity, their holy lives and holy teaching, they might season the whole world. But if the salt have lost its saltness (ἐὰν τὸ ἅλας ἄναλον γένηται), wherewith will ye season it? This insipid, tasteless condition of salt is familiar to travelers in the East Examples are to be found of largo masses of salt which \"has lost its savor.\" Our Lord here applies this in a spiritual sense to his disciples. \"If ye, my disciples, who are the salt of the earth, - if ye lose the true properties of salt; if your Christianity loses its heart, its quickening, stimulating influence; so that on account of the love of the world, or the fear of man, or through lust or ambition, you fall away from the heavenly doctrine and life; - who shall restore you to your former spiritual health and vigor? With what can salt itself be seasoned when its own chemical energies are lost?\" Our Lord plays upon this figure of salt, and cautions his disciples, lest by any means they should lose the qualities of this mystic salt. Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another. This sentence fitly winds up the whole. Have the salt of wisdom and purity, and of a Christian life, namely, humility, charity, contempt of the world, and especially peace. Do not be idly contending about place or position, as not long ago you were disputing (ver. 33). Our Lord foresaw that this kind of contention, these rivalries, and these ambitious aims, would prove a great scandal and a great hindranee to the progress of his Church in the future ages of the world. But he also knew that if his disciples in every ago would endeavor to \"keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,\" their influence would be irresistible, and they would draw all men to them and to himself, the great Centre of attraction, and \"the confidence of all the ends of the earth\" (Psalm 65:5).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
