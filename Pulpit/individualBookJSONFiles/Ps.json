All ye lands; literally, all the earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm100:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTServe the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Serve the Lord with gladness. \"Gladness\" is the emphatic word. Almost every clause of the psalm contains some such call. Come before his presence with singing; or, with a cry of joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm100:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Know ye that the Lord he is God; or, be sure - \"recognize the fact as a certainty\" (see the Prayer book Version). It is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; or, according to another reading, and his are we. This latter reading is preferred by De Wette, Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version. But the other, which was the reading of the LXX., and is supported by the Vulgate and the old commentators generally, should, however, be retained, as yielding a better sense (see the arguments of Hengstenberg, 'Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 3. p. 201, Engl. trans.). We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture (comp. Psalm 74:1; Psalm 79:13; Psalm 95:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm100:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEnter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise. The mention of\" gates\" and\" courts\" points primarily to the temple worship, but the reference may be, as Professor Alexander suggests, \"typical or metaphorical\" rather than literal, and may extend to all the faithful and to all places of worship. Be thankful unto him; or, give thanks unto him (Revised Version). And bless his Name (comp. Psalm 96:2; Psalm 145:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm100:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For the Lord is good (comp. 1 Chronicles 16:34; 2 Chronicles 5:13; 2 Chronicles 7:3; Ezra 3:11; Psalm 106:1; Psalm 107:1; Psalm 118:1, 29; Psalm 125:3; Psalm 136:1; Psalm 145:9, etc.). His mercy is everlasting; literally, his mercy is forever. Compare the frequent refrain, \"His mercy endureth forever\" (Psalm 118:1-4, 29; Psalm 136:1-26, etc.). And his truth (or, his faithfulness) endureth to all generations; literally, to generation and generation. All men's hope is in God's \"faithfulness,\" that he will keep his promises to them - pardon them, deliver them, cleanse them, and give them rest in his kingdom forever.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.101":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I will sing of mercy and judgment. The writer does not mean that he is about, in this present psalm, to sing of God's mercy and justice, but that he will make it one of the rules of his life to do so. Unto thee, O Lord, will I sing; or, \"will I make melody\" (Cheyne, Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way (comp. Psalm 18:22; Isaiah 26:7). The psalmist aspires after \"perfectness.\" Then feeling his inability to walk in the perfect way by his own strength, he cries to God for aid - O when wilt thou come unto me? \"Unless,\" i.e., \"thou come unto me, I cannot keep one of these resolutions. O Lord, come quickly.\" I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. It is not only the \"way,\" or conduct, that requires to be \"perfect,\" but the \"heart\" also, or the motives from which the conduct springs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes; or, no base thing (Revised Version); \"no villainous thing\" (Cheyne, Kay); comp. Deuteronomy 15:9. I will set before me nothing of this kind, \"as an object either of imitation or of attainment.\" I hate the work of them that turn aside; literally, the doing of acts that swerve; i.e. \"that depart from the right way.\" It shall not cleave to me. If such a thing \"seized on him unawares, he would shake it off as a thing accursed\" (Kay); comp. Deuteronomy 13:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - A froward heart shall depart from me; i.e. I will put away from me all perversity of heart; I will root it out and rid myself of it. I will not know a wicked person. This is a possible meaning, but it is better to translate, with our Revisers, \"I will know no evil thing.\" The \"principles of private conduct\" may be summed up under the four heads ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) devotion;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) endeavour after perfectness;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) avoidance of evil;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) hatred of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I out off. (On the heinousness of slander, see Psalm 15:3; Psalm 31:13; Psalm 50:20, etc.) It is probably not meant that the slanderer will be put to death, but only that he will be banished, at any rate from the court, and, so far as possible, put down. Him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer. \"Lofty looks\" and a \"proud heart\" are again conjoined in Proverbs 21:4, Solomon showing that he paid attention to his father's lessons. David himself disclaims both in Psalm 131:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land; i.e. \"my favour shall be shown to them; I will give them help and encouragement.\" That they may dwell with me; i.e. \"frequent my court,\" either as officials or as simple courtiers. He that walketh in a perfect way (see the comment on ver. 2). He shall serve me; i.e. \"shall be promoted to office under my government.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house. It is the duty of a king to see, not only that his own ways are blameless, but that his entire household is well ordered, and consists of righteous persons (comp. Job 1:5). \"Deceit\" here means \"wickedness\" generally. He that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight; literally, shall not be established; i.e. shall not keep his position in my court, but be banished from it. \"Lying\" is one of the sins which the psalmists denounce most frequently (see Psalm 31:18; Psalm 40:4; Psalm 52:3; Psalm 58:3; Psalm 59:12; Psalm 62:4; Psalm 63:11; Psalm 119:163, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm101:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; literally, each morn will I root out all the wicked of the land; i.e. \"day after day I will make it my endeavour, not only to keep my palace free from evil doers, but to cleanse the whole land of them.\" David is determined to exercise that just severity which is a part of the duty of kings (Romans 13:4), and not to be that curse to a country - a weak and over-indulgent ruler (see Calvin, ad loc.). That I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord. So long as there were \"wicked doers\" in the land, they would be sure to flock to Jerusalem, since the capital always attracts the criminal classes. David is especially anxious that Jerusalem, which he has made \"the city of the Lord\" (2 Samuel 6:12-19), shall be kept free from the pollutions of evil doers, but, to effect this object, he must purge the whole land. The spirit breathed is that of Psalm 15:1-5.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.102":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee (comp.

As the \"light of God's countenance\" is the greatest of all goods (Psalm 4:6), so its withdrawal is the worst of evils. In the day when I am in trouble; literally, in the day of my trouble, or of my straits. Incline thine ear unto me (comp. Psalm 17:6; Psalm 71:2; Psalm 88:2, etc.). In the day when I call, answer me speedily. Compare the versicles of our Prayer book, \"O God, make speed to save us; O Lord, make haste to help us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For my days are consumed like smoke; or, according to another reading (בעשׁר, instead of כעשׁר), \"are consumed into smoke,\" i.e. \"disappear, pass away into nothingness.\" And my bones are burned as an hearth. Dr. Kay translates, \"My bones smoulder like a firebrand,\" which is better (compare the Prayer book Version, and see Leviticus 6:2 and Isaiah 33:14). (For the sentiment, see Psalm 31:10; Psalm 32:3; Psalm 42:10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My heart is smitten. As with a stroke from the sun (see Psalm 121:6; Hosea 9:16). And withered like grass. As grass upon the house tops (Psalm 129:6), or, indeed, in any exposed place under an Eastern sun. So that I forget to eat my bread; literally, for I forget, etc. The fact is adduced as a proof of the heart's condition (comp. Job 33:20; 1 Samuel 1:7; 1 Samuel 20:34, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - By reason of the voice of my groaning; i.e. \"by reason of the affliction which causes my groaning.\" My bones cleave to my skin; literally, to my flesh, but the Authorized Version rightly expresses the meaning (comp. Job 19:20; Lamentations 4:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I am like a pelican in the wilderness. The Hebrew word here rendered \"pelican\" is elsewhere in our version translated by \"cormorant\" (Leviticus 11:7; Deuteronomy 14:17; Isaiah 34:11; Zephaniah 2:14); but it is now generally believed that the pelican is intended (compare the Septuagint πελεκᾶνι, and see Mr. Houghton's letter in the Academy, April 5, 1884, and the versions of Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, and our Revisers). The pelican is a bird which haunts marshy and desolate places. It abounds in the Lake Huleh in Northern Galilee (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 260). I am like an owl of the desert; or, \"of the ruins.\" The owl haunts ruins in the East no less than in our own country (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 484, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. Sparrows are very common in Palestine. Dr. Thomson says that he has often heard a sparrow which had lost its mate, uttering \"by the hour\" its sad lament, seated upon a housetop ('The Land and the Book,' p. 43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Mine enemies reproach me all the day. The reproach of their enemies was always felt by the Israelites as a bitter aggravation of their afflictions (see Psalm 42:10; Psalm 44:13-16; Psalm 79:4; Psalm 80:6, etc.). They that are mad against me are sworn against me; rather, use me as their curse (comp. Jeremiah 29:22). It was a common form of cursing among the Israelites to wish a man the same fate as had befallen some one whose unhappiness was notorious.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For I have eaten ashes like bread; i.e. \"the 'ashes' of humiliation have been my food. I have, as it were, fed on them.\" A literal mingling of ashes with his food is not to be thought cf. And mingled my drink with weeping (comp. Psalm 42:3; Psalm 80:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Because of thine indignation and thy wrath. \"The bitterest ingredient of our cup of sorrow,\" says Dean Johnson, \"is to know that it is owing to Jehovah's wrath and fierce anger for sin.\" For thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. \"Elevated me,\" i.e. \"only to cast me down, and so make my affliction the greater.\" The allusion is probably to the former prosperity of the speaker, and of Israel generally, in their own land, and their present misery in Babylon (compare, however, Job 27:21; Job 30:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My days are like a shadow that declineth; literally, that lengthens, as shadows do when the day declines (comp. ver. 24). The psalmist, like his nation, is old before his time; the shades of evening have come upon him, when he should have been in his midday brightness. And I am withered like grass (comp. ver. 4). The \"I\" here is emphatic (אני) - not only is the psalmist's heart withered, but he himself is altogether scorched and dried up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The second part of the psalm here begins. Against the complaint is to be set the confident hope and consolation. But thou, O Lord, shalt endure forever. God does not \"wither\" or decay - God and God's purposes \"endure forever.\" It matters not that Israel is brought so low, and seems at the last gasp; God can raise up his people, and will do so in his own good time (vers. 13-17). And thy remembrance unto all generations; or, thy memorial (Revised Version); see Exodus 3:15. God's \"remembrance,\" or \"memorial,\" consists in the recollection, that his faithful ones have, of his historically manifested attributes. If this recollection is never to pass away, his faithful ones must remain also, to keep it up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion (comp. Psalm 3:7; Psalm 12:5; Psalm 68:1). God is said to \"arise,\" when he bestirs himself to take vengeance on his enemies, and deliver his saints out of their hands. The \"Zion,\" on which he would \"have mercy,\" was not the city only, but the people belonging to it. For the time to favour her (or, pity her), yea, the set time, is come. By \"the set time\" is probably meant the time fixed by Jeremiah for the termination of the Captivity and the restoration of Jerusalem (Jeremiah 25:11, 12; Jeremiah 29:10), and alluded to by Daniel in Daniel 9:2. This time, the psalmist says, approaches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For thy servants take pleasure in her stones (comp. Isaiah 64:10, 11; Lamentations 4:1; Nehemiah 2:13; Nehemiah 4:2). To this day the same affection is shown by Israelite pilgrims at the \"Jews' Wailing Place.\" And favour (rather, pity) the dust thereof. The rubbish in which the stones lay (Nehemiah 4:2) seems to be intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So the heathen shall fear the Name of the Lord (comp. Isaiah 59:19). The restoration of Jerusalem could not but impress great numbers of the heathen, and tend to the enlargement of Jehovah's kingdom. And all the kings of the earth thy glory. Oriental hyperbole, if confined to the immediate effects of the rebuilding of the earthly Jerusalem; but simple truth, if extended to the establishment on earth of the new and heavenly Jerusalem (Isaiah 65:17-25; Revelation 21:1-24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - When the Lord shall build up Zion; rather, because the Lord hath built up Zion. The psalmist, in prophetic ecstasy, sees the future as past. The verbs in this and the next verse are all preterite. He shall appear in his glory; rather, hath appeared in his glory (see Isaiah 40:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer; rather, he hath regarded... and hath not despised (see the Revised Version). The word translated \"destitute\" is elsewhere (Jeremiah 17:6) only used as the name of a shrub - probably the dwarf juniper, still so called by the Arabs. The dwarf juniper has \"a gloomy stunted appearance\" (Tristram), and well symbolizes the Israel of the Captivity period, dry and withered, like a wretched desert shrub.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - This shall be written for the generation to come; or, let it be written; γραφήτω αὕτη, LXX. The mercy of God in restoring his people to their own land and city must be recorded in writing, as his past mercies have been (Exodus 17:14; Deuteronomy 31:19), for the edification of future generations. The record was made by Ezra and Nehemiah. And the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord. Restored Israel is spoken of as a new creation (comp. Psalm 22:31; Isaiah 43:7, 21). It was, indeed, a sort of resurrection from the dead (see Ezekiel 37:1-10). (For the \"praise\" immediately rendered, see Ezra 3:10, 11; Ezra 6:16-22; Nehemiah 12:27-43.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary. God's true sanctuary is the heaven of heavens wherein he dwells. Earthly sanctuaries are but shadows of this. From heaven did the Lord behold the earth (comp. Exodus 2:23-25). As God in the days of old had looked down on the affliction of his people in Egypt, so did he now \"look down\" and \"behold\" their sufferings in Babylon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - To hear the groaning of the prisoner (see Exodus 2:24, \"God heard their groaning;\" and comp. Exodus 3:7; Exodus 6:5). To loose those that are appointed to death; literally, the sons of death (comp. Psalm 79:11). Captive Israel regarded its life in Babylon as little better than death (see Ezekiel 37:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - To declare the Name of the Lord in Zion; rather, as in the Revised Version, that men may declare. The great object of Israel's restoration was the glory of God - that Jew and heathen, joined together in one, might unitedly bless God, and praise his glorious Name. The complete fulfilment was, of course, only after the coming of Christ. And his praise in Jerusalem. Especially in the \"new Jerusalem\" (see the comment on ver. 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - When the people (rather, the peoples) are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord (comp. Psalm 22:27; Psalm 68:29-32; Isaiah 49:6, 7, 18, etc).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-28. - The third strophe begins with an acknowledgment of weakness - a sort of \"renewed complaint\" (Hengstenberg). But from this there is an ascent to a higher confidence than any displayed previously - a confidence that God, who is everlasting (vers. 24-27), will perpetually protect his people, and, whatever becomes of the existing generation, will establish their seed before him forever (ver. 28). Verse 23. - He weakened my strength in the way. The reading \"my strength\" (כחי) is greatly to be preferred to that of \"his strength\" (כחו), which cannot be made to yield a tolerable meaning. It is judiciously adopted by Professor Cheyne, who translates, \"He has brought down my strength in the way,\" and explains \"the way\" as \"the journey of life.\" So also Rosenmuller and Hengstenberg. He shortened my days; i.e. \"made me grow old prematurely\" (comp. ver.] 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days. Compare the complaint of Hezekiah (Isaiah 38:10). A pious Israelite regarded himself as entitled to a fairly long life, which was promised him directly (Exodus 20:12) and by implication, since it was only the wicked that were \"not to live out half their days\" (Psalm 55:23). Thy years are throughout all generations. Dathe and Professor Cheyne translate, \"O thou, whose years are eternal.\" But the Hebrew will scarcely admit of this rendering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth (comp. Isaiah 48:13). And the heavens are the work of thy hands (see Genesis 1:1, 7; Genesis 2:4; Psalm 89:11; Hebrews 1:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They shall perish. The coming destruction of the world that now is, is very frequently declared in Holy Scripture (see Isaiah 51:6; Isaiah 65:17; Matthew 24:35; Mark 13:31; Luke 21:33; 2 Peter 3:7, 10, 12). But thou shalt endure. With the perishable nature of the whole material creation, the psalmist contrasts the absolute eternity of God (comp. ver. 12; also Psalm 9:7; Hebrews 1:11). Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment (comp. Isaiah 51:6). As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed. Compare the prophecies of \"a new heaven and a new earth\" (Isaiah 55:17; 66:22; 2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - But thou art the same; literally, but thou art HE (comp. Isaiah 44:4; Isaiah 46:4); i.e. \"thou art the one eternal and unchangeable existence - the one reality.\" And thy years shall have no end. It is by an accommodation to human modes of thought that God's \"years\" are spoken cf. An eternal existence is a unity - not made up of years and days.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm102:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The children of thy servants shall continue. \"The nation descended from those who served thee of old shall continue,\" or, \"abide\" - i.e. not only continue to exist, but have a permanent abid-ing-place (comp. Psalm 37:39; Psalm 69:36). And their seed shall be established before thee (comp. Jeremiah 30:20).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.103":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Bless the Lord, O my soul. Repeated in ver. 2; also at the end of the psalm; and again in Psalm 104:1, 35. To \"bless\" is more than to praise; it is to praise with affection and gratitude. The psalmist calls upon his own soul, and so on each individual soul, to begin the song of praise, which is to terminate in a general chorus of blessing from all creation (vers. 20-22). And all that is within me. \"All my whole nature - intellect, emotion, feeling, sentiment - brain, heart, lungs, tongue,\" etc. Bless his holy Name; i.e. his manifested Personality, which is almost the same thing as himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Bless the Lord, O my soul. Repetition, in Holy Scripture, is almost always for the sake of emphasis. It is not \"vain repetition.\" Our Lord often uses it: \"Verily, verily, I say unto you;\" \"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? .... Feed my sheep... Feed my sheep.\" And forget not all his benefits (comp. Deuteronomy 6:12; Deuteronomy 8:11, 14, etc.). Man is so apt to \"forget,\" that he requires continual exhortation not to do so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Who forgiveth all thine iniquities. This is the first and greatest of \"benefits,\" and is therefore placed first, as that for which we ought, above all else, to bless God. God's forgiveness of sin is a frequent topic with the psalmists (see Psalm 25:11, 18; Psalm 32:1; Psalm 51:9; Psalm 85:2; Psalm 86:5, etc.). Who healeth all thy diseases. This is best understood literally - not as mere \"parallelism.\" Among the greatest blessings which we receive of God is recovery from sickness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Who redeemeth thy life from destruction. When sickness seems about to be mortal, or when danger threatens from foes, God often steps in and \"redeems\" men - i.e, saves them, rescues them (see Psalm 56:13; Psalm 116:8; Isaiah 38:16, 20). Who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies (comp. Psalm 8:5; Psalm 18:50; Psalm 23:6, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things. So Dean Johnson and our Revisers. But the rendering of עדי by \"mouth\" is very doubtful. The original meaning of the word seems to have been \"gay ornament,\" whence it passed to \"gaiety,\" \"desire of enjoyment,\" \"desire\" generally (τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν σου, LXX.). Dr. Kay translates, \"thy gay heart;\" Professor Cheyne, \"thy desire.\" God satisfies the reasonable desires of his servants, giving them \"all things richly to enjoy\" (1 Timothy 6:17), and \"satisfying the desire of every living thing\" (Psalm 145:16). So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's; rather, like an eagle (comp. Isaiah 40:31). The meaning is, not \"thy youth is renewed as an eagle's youth is,\" for an eagle's youth is not renewed; but \"thy youth is renewed, and is become in its strength like an eagle.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment; literally, righteousnesses and judgments; i.e. \"acts of righteousness and acts of judgment.\" For all that are oppressed. The care of God for the \"oppressed\" is a marked feature of Holy Scripture (see Exodus 2:23-25; Exodus 3:9; Judges 2:18; Judges 6:9; Job 35:9-14; Psalm 9:9; Psalm 10:18; 79:21; 146:7; Isaiah 1:17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He made known his ways unto Moses. God's ways are \"past finding out\" by man (Romans 11:33); they must be \"made known\" to him. God made them known to Moses by the revelations which he gave him, especially those of Sinai. His acts unto the children of Israel. The rest of the Israelites were taught mainly by God's \"acts\" - not that his words were concealed from them, but becauseNEWLINENEWLINE\"Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures,NEWLINEQuam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. This was a part of the revelation made to Moses (Exodus 34:6), whose words the psalmist closely echoes, both here and in Psalm 86:15 (comp. also Psalm 111:4; Psalm 112:4; Psalm 145:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He will not always chide; or, contend (see Isaiah 57:16; and comp. Jeremiah 3:5, 12). God will relent from his anger and forgive men, after a while. He will not be \"extreme to mark what is done amiss.\" Neither will he keep his anger forever. He is not implacable. He will accept repentance and amendment (Ezekiel 18:27) He will accept atonement (1 John 2:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us (rather, requited us) according to our iniquities. God never punishes men so much as they deserve to be punished; \"in his wrath he\" always \"thinketh upon mercy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him (comp. Psalm 36:5, \"Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds\"). The metaphor is bold, yet inadequate; for God's mercy is infinite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. God's mercy is the cause, the removal of sin the result. The two are commensurate, and are \"described by the largest measures which the earth can afford.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLike as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him (comp. Deuteronomy 32:6; Job 10:8; Isaiah 29:16; Isaiah 63:16; Isaiah 64:8, etc.). (For the nature of the \"fear\" spoken of, both here and in ver. 11, see the description in vers. 17, 18.) It must be a fear that produces obedience, or, in New Testament phrase, that is a \"godly fear\" (Hebrews 12:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For he knoweth our frame; or, our formation (Kay) - the manner in which we were formed (see Genesis 2:7). He remembereth that we are dust (comp. Genesis 2:7; Genesis 3:19; Genesis 19:27; Job 34:15, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - As for man, his days are as grass. Here is a new departure. From the loving kindness and mercy of God the psalmist passes to the weakness and helplessness of man. Man is like grass (Psalm 37:2; Psalm 90:5, 6; Psalm 102:11; Isaiah 40:6-8, etc.). His days fleet and fade. He never \"continueth in one stay.\" As a flower of the field (comp. Job 14:2; Isaiah 28:1; Isaiah 40:6; James 1:10; 1 Peter 1:24, etc.). He flourisheth; i.e. he cometh up in full vigour, glorious to look upon, rejoicing in his youth and strength, but within a little time he fadeth, falleth away, or is \"cut down, dried up, and withered.\" There is no strength or stability in him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; literally, it is not. The burning sirocco, the wind of the desert, variously named in various places, blows upon the flower, and almost immediately scorches it up. So man, when he flourishes most, is for the most part brought low by the wind of suffering, trouble, sickness, calamity, and sinks out of sight. And the place thereof shall know it no more; rather, knows it no more. Seeing it not, forgets it, as if it had never been. So with the greatest men - they pass away and are forgotten (comp. Job 7:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him (comp. vers. 11, 13). Through this \"everlasting mercy\" of God, man, though so feeble and fragile, does not wholly pass away, but continues to be the recipient of God's bounty. And his righteousness unto children's children. God's \"righteousness\" is his everlasting justice, by which he gives to men according to their deserts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - To such as keep his covenant; i.e. \"to the faithful\" - to those who, notwithstanding many lapses and many shortcomings, are yet sincere in heart, and seek to do his will. Such persons remember his commandments to do them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The Lord hath prepared (or, established) his throne in the heavens. In conclusion, the incomparable majesty of God is set before us, in contrast with the feebleness of man, and he is put forward as the one and only fit Object of worship, alike to the spiritual (vers. 20, 21) and the material creation (ver. 22a), as well as to the psalmist himself (ver. 22b). Seated on his everlasting throne, he challenges the adoration of the whole universe. And his kingdom ruleth over all (comp. Psalm 47:2; Daniel 4:34, 35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Bless the Lord, ye his angels (comp. Psalm 148:2). That excel in strength. The angels that \"excel in strength\" - literally, are mighty in strength - may best be understood as those called in the New Testament \"archangels\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16; Jude 1:9), the highest of the glorious beings that stand around the throne of God (Revelation 8:2, 6; Revelation 10:1) and execute his behests. These are they that, in an especial sense, do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts. Here the inferior angels seem to be meant - that \"multitude of the host of heaven\" which appeared to the shepherds on Christ's natal day (Luke 2:13), and which is elsewhere often referred to in Holy Scripture (see Psalm 24:10; Psalm 148:2; Isaiah 40:26; Matthew 25:31; Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26; Hebrews 12:22; Jude 1:14). Ye ministers of his (comp. Psalm 104:4) that do his pleasure. The inferior, no less than the superior, ranks of angels continually carry out the will of God, being \"ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation\" (Hebrews 1:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm103:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion (comp. Psalm 19:1-4; Psalm 145:10; Psalm 148:7-13). The \"works of God\" - i.e. his material universe - cannot, of course, he said to \"bless\" God in the same sense that men and angels do; but, in a language of their own, they set forth his glory, and to the poetic mind seem truly to sing his praise. The \"Song of the Three Children\" is a natural outburst from devout hearts. Bless the Lord, O my soul (comp. ver. 1, and the comment ad loc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.104":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless the LORD, O my soul.

The keynote is struck at once. All the rest will be nothing but a development of this vast theme - God's greatness. Thou art clothed with honour and majesty; or \"thou hast robed thyself in glory and grandeur\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment. Light was the first thing created (Genesis 1:3), before either the heaven (Genesis 1:6-8) or the earth (Genesis 1:9, 10). In light God, the invisible, as it were, enshrouds himself, making it the image of his hidden glory. Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; or, \"a canopy\" (comp. Isaiah 40:22; Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:25). The metaphor is taken from the stretching out or \"spreading out\" of a tent (see Isaiah 40:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters. God forms himself an upper chamber, as a dwelling place, in \"the waters that are above the firmament\" (Genesis 1:7), as a man builds himself an upper chamber with beams and rafters. Who maketh the clouds his chariot (comp. Isaiah 19:1, \"Behold, the Lord rideth upon a thick cloud\"). Who walketh upon the wings of the wind (comp. Psalm 18:10). The anthropomorphism will be pardoned for the sake of the beauty of the imagery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Who maketh his angels spirits. Professor Cheyne renders, \"Who maketh his messengers of winds;\" and so (in substance) Jarchi, Aben. Ezra, Rosenmuller, Professor Alexander, and even Hengstenberg. The difficulty in adopting this rendering is that furnished by the application of the passage in Hebrews 1:7; but the arguments of Hengstenberg go far to meet that difficulty. It is to be noted that our Revisers, while admitting either rendering, have preferred that of Professor Cheyne. And his ministers a flaming fire; or, \"his ministers of flame and fire.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Who laid the foundations of the earth; rather, as in the margin, who founded the earth upon her bases; i.e. fixed the earth in its place, on bases - not necessarily material bases - which keep it steadily where it is (comp. Job 26:7). That it should not be removed forever (comp. Psalm 93:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou coveredst it with the deep, as with a garment (see Genesis 1:9). A watery covering was spread at first over the whole earth, and enveloped it like a garment. The waters stood above the mountains. The highest inequalities of the land were concealed under the watery integument.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - At thy rebuke they fled. It required only a few words from God (Genesis 1:9) for the whole surface of the earth to be changed. The waters \"fled\" - they shifted their place - removed from some portions of the earth's surface, and \"gathered themselves together\" into others, allowing the dry land to appear. Elevations and depressions of the land must have at the same time occurred. At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away (comp. Job 40:9, \"Hast thou an arm like God, or canst thou thunder with a voice like his?\"). The voice of God, especially when he speaks in \"rebuke,\" is as thunder,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys; rather, they went up mountains; they went down valleys. In the general commotion of the waters, as they \"hasted away,\" sometimes vast waves swept over mountain tops, sometimes huge floods washed down the courses of valleys - a graphic description of the scene which no eye saw, but which the poet figures to himself - a turmoil and confusion beyond that even of the great Deluge itself (see Genesis 7:17-19; Genesis 8:1-3). Unto the place which thou hast (rather, hadst) founded for them. The ocean bed, which had, in intention, been already prepared to receive them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou hast set (or, didst set) a bound that they may not (rather, might not) pass over (comp. Job 38:10, 11; Jeremiah 5:22). The Deluge is for the time beyond the ken of the poet, who is singing God's greatness in nature, and in the general laws under which he has placed it. Neither turn again to cover the earth. This law, once Broken by the miracle of the Deluge, was thenceforth made absolute and inviolable (Genesis 9:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He sendeth the springs into the valleys; rather, into the water courses, or torrent beds - dry for the greater part of the year, but deriving life and beauty from the springs which, after rain has fallen, flow into them. Which run among the hills; literally, between the hills (i.e. the hill slopes on either side) they wend their way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They give drink to every beast of the field. God's mercy is \"over all his works\" (Psalm 145:9). He careth for the whole animal creation (see Exodus 20:10; Exodus 23:19; Deuteronomy 25:4; Psalm 104:27; Psalm 145:15, 16; Jonah 4:11, etc.). The wild asses quench their thirst. Herodotus (4:192) says that wild asses are ἄποτοι - i.e. \"do not drink\" but modern travellers declare the contrary. They drink infrequently, and are so shy, that at such times they rarely fall under human observation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - By them; i.e. \"by the springs\" (see ver. 10). Shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation. Birds need water as much as any other animals, and in dry tracts frequently congregate at the springs. Which sing (or, utter a voice) among the branches of the trees which in the East spring up wherever there is moisture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He (i.e. God) watereth the hills from his chambers (comp. ver. 3). The mountains themselves, even their highest tops, are not left dry. Where springs cannot reach, rain falls from God's \"chambers\" in the sky, and spreads equal refreshment. The earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. The whole earth - mountains, hills, plains, valleys - is thus \"satisfied,\" i.e. sufficiently supplied with water, by the means which God has elaborated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle. The results of God's careful arrangements are now spoken cf. In the first place, grass - fodder of every kind - is provided for the beasts on which man's life so greatly depends - a boon both to man and beast, of inestimable value. Next, there is brought forth herb for the service of man - i.e. for his direct service - vegetables and fruits for his food; spicy shrubs for his delectation; flax, papyrus, saffron, aloes, etc., for his use. That he may bring forth food out of the earth. That man himself may by his labour, by the cultivation of the natural products, obtain from the earth the food suitable to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And wine that maketh glad the heart of man. The food suitable to man consists, first, of wine, which gladdens his heart (comp. Judges 9:13); secondly, of oil to make his face to shine, or give him a cheerful countenance; and thirdly, of bread, which strengtheneth man's heart, which is \"the staff of life,\" and the main sustenance of the entire body. It was the glory of the promised land to produce in abundance these three essentials (Deuteronomy 8:8; Deuteronomy 11:14; 2 Kings 18:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The trees of the Lord are full of sap; rather, are satisfied, or have their fill; i.e. drink in sufficiently God's rain, so that they grow up and flourish amazingly. Even the cedars of Lebanon (see Psalm 29:5, 6; Psalm 92:11). These are particularized as the grandest of God's vegetable productions known to the psalmist (comp. Judges 9:15; 1 Kings 4:33; 2 Kings 14:19; Isaiah 2:13; Ezekiel 31:3). Which he hath planted (comp. Numbers 24:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Wherein the birds make their nests (comp. above, ver. 10). As for the stork, the fir trees are her house. Again, God's care for the animal creation is in the psalmist's mind. As the grass is \"caused to grow for the cattle\" (ver. 14), so trees - even the grandest - are partly intended for the birds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats. Even the desolate ranges of the higher mountains are designed by God for the good of his creatures. They furnish a refuge for the ibex, or wild goat, when the hunter presses ca him; and, if they cannot give him food, give him safety. And the rocks for the conies; rather, for the marmots. Marmots still inhabit Palestine, though they are rarely seen; \"conies,\" i.e. rabbits do not. The marmots are \"a feeble folk, that make their houses in the rocks\" (Proverbs 30:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He appointed the moon for seasons (comp.

The Jewish festivals depended greatly on the moon, the Passover being celebrated at the time of the full moon of the first month (Exodus 12:6), and the other festivals depending mostly on the Passover. And the sun knoweth his going down. Observes the laws, that is to say, appointed for him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - Thou makest darkness, and it is night. The mention of the moon and sun introduces a picture of night (vers. 20, 21) and a picture of the day (vers. 22, 23). The day draws in - darkness descends - night is come. At once there is a stir in the animal world. Man has gone to his rest; but the time is arrived wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The primeval jungle is alive with motion and sound. All the animals are on the alert. seeking their prey. The young lions are heard above all; they roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God. The awful sound of their hungry roar drowns almost all other sounds, and shakes with terror the hearts of those that hear. Suddenly, however, night turns into day -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - The sun ariseth. Bright beams of light flame up the eastern sky; and earth basks in the sun's smile. But it is a signal to the lions and the other wild beasts to withdraw. They gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. Hiding themselves from the eye of day, and retreating into places where they are safe. Then it is the turn of humanity to reappear. Humanity wakes up; and man goeth forth auto his work and to his labour uutil the evening; i.e. man proceeds to his appointed task, which is \"work\" - once a curse (Genesis 3:17-19), now a blessing (Ephesians 4:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMan goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - O Lord, how manifold are thy works! This is a parenthetic ejaculation, from which the psalmist cannot refrain, as he contemplates creation so far. It breaks the continuity of his description (vers. 2-32), but not unpleasingly. In wisdom hast thou made them all (comp. Proverbs 3:19, \"The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens\"). (On the \"wisdom\" of God, as shown in creation, see the whole series of 'Bridgewater Treatises.') The earth is full of thy riches; or possessions (comp. Psalm 105:21). \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof\" (Psalm 24:1). Creation gives the right of ownership.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - So is this great and wide sea; rather, yonder sea too (is thy work), so great and wide stretching. Wherein are things creeping (rather, moving things) innumerable. The abundant life of the sea, even in its depths, is the admiration of all naturalists. Tens of thousands of microscopic shells have been brought to light by the dredger's labours almost everywhere. Both small and great beasts. Microscopic shellfish on the one hand; seals, walruses, sharks, whales, on the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - There go the ships. These may seem out of place among the works of God. But are they not his, in a certain sense? Did he not contemplate them when he made the sea, and make it to some extent for them? And did he not give men wisdom to invent and perfect them? There is that leviathan. \"Leviathan\" is here probably the whale, which may in early times have frequented the Mediterranean. Which thou hast made to play therein; or, to play with him. So the LXX. (ἐμπαίζειν αὐτῷ); and, among moderns, Ewald, Hitzig, Olshausen, Kay, Cheyne, and our Revisers (in the margin). The anthropomorphism is not beyond that of other passages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season (see vers. 14, 23).

Thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good; or, \"are satisfied with good\" (Kay, Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled. If God withdraws the light of his countenance from any living thing, instantly it feels the loss. It is \"troubled,\" cast down, confounded (comp. Psalm 30:7). Thou takest away their breath, they die. As the living things have life from God, so they have death from him. Not one of them perishes but he knows it, and causes it or allows it (see Matthew 10:29). And return to their dust. Return, i.e., to the dead matter out of which they were created.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Thou sendest forth thy spirit; or, thy breath. As God \"breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life\" (Genesis 2:7), so it is an effluence from him that gives life to every living thing. They are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. As after the Deluge (see Genesis 7:4; Genesis 8:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The glory of the Lord shall endure forever; rather, let the glory of the Lord, etc. The psalmist prays that there may be no further interruption of the glorious course of nature besides the Deluge, which has come into his thoughts in connection with the destruction of animal life (ver. 29). Henceforward he trusts and prays that the Lord shall rejoice in his works, and not again repent him that he has made them (Genesis 6:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth (comp. Psalm 18:7; Psalm 114:7). The earth \"trembles,\" as knowing that it can be destroyed at any moment. He toucheth the hills, and they smoke; or, the mountains - the strongest portions of the earth (Psalm 36:6; Psalm 65:6) - \"smoke\" when he touches them (see Exodus 19:18; Deuteronomy 4:11; Psalm 144:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-35. - The peroration (like the opening) is simple praise of God himself, considered in himself. All his life the psalmist will praise God (ver. 33) - his soul shall praise him (ver. 35), he will be glad in him (ver. 34); finally, he calls upon all men to join in his praise (ver. 35, last clause). Verse 33. - I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live (comp. Psalm 63:4; Psalm 146:2): I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. An echo of the preceding hemistich.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - My meditation of him shall be sweet; rather, may my meditation be pleasing to him! (Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). I be glad in the Lord (comp. Psalm 32:11; Psalm 33:1, etc.). Rejoicing in the Lord is a form of praising him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm104:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth; i.e. \"Let the great blot upon creation - sin and sinners - exist no more. Let the harmony upon the earth be complete, by the elimination of this \"one jarring string.\" And let the wicked be no more. Repetition for the sake of emphasis. Bless thou the Lord, O my soul. Then, when this blot is removed, when the trials of the godly, from the persecutions and vexations of sinners, are over, it will be the part of my soul, with greater heartiness than ever, to \"bless the Lord.\" Praise ye the Lord. Then, too, all mankind may well be called upon to join in a chorus of praise and blessing, and to sing, as saints and angels sing in the courts of heaven, \"Hallelujah!\" (Revelation 19:1, 3, 4, 6).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.105":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - The psalmist exhorts the seed of Abraham (ver. 6) to give thanks to God and call upon his Name (vers. 1-3); to make him known among the Gentiles (ver. 1b); to seek him and his strength (ver. 4); and to bear in mind his marvellous works (ver. 5). The \"works\" intended are those of his providential government of mankind, and especially those of his rule and government over his people Israel. Verse 1. - O give thanks unto the Lord (comp. Psalm 106:1; Psalm 107:1; Psalm 111:1; Psalm 136:1; Psalm 138:1). Call upon his Name; i.e. call upon him with prayer and praise, \"according to his historically manifested glory\" (Hengstenberg). Make known his deeds (or, \"his doings\") among the people; rather, among the peoples; i.e. the heathen nations (comp. Psalm 18:49; Psalm 57:9; Isaiah 12:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; or,\" make melody unto him\" (Cheyne); i.e. praise his Name (ver. 1) with song and music. Talk ye of all his wondrous works (comp. Psalm 119:37, 46), Those who are full of gratitude to God for all his mercies that he has vouchsafed them cannot refrain from speaking of his goodness when they converse with others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGlory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Glory ye in his holy Name (comp. Psalm 34:2, \"My soul shall glory in the Lord'). As worldly men glory in their strength and riches, so the saints of God glory in God. Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord (comp. Psalm 33:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Seek the Lord, and his strength: seek his face evermore. Turn to the Lord, not from him; seek his favour, his support, the light of his countenance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Remember his marvellous works that he hath done (see ver. 2). These \"wondrous works\" are apter than anything else to stir up the heart to gratitude and thankfulness to God; and therefore they naturally lead on to the utterance of praise and thanksgiving. His wonders; or, \"miracles\" - τὰ τέρατα αὐτοῦ, LXX. - such as those touched on in vers. 27-36 and 39-41. And the judgments of his mouth. His sentences upon sinners, as upon the Egyptians (vers. 28, et seqq.) and upon the Canaanites (vers. 11, 44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - O ye seed of Abraham his servant; i.e. \"his faithful and obedient follower\" (see below, ver. 42; and comp. Genesis 26:24; Galatians 3:9). Ye children of Jacob his chosen; rather, his chosen ones. The word is in the plural, and must be referred, not to \"Jacob,\" but to \"children.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He is the Lord our God; rather, he, Jehovah, is our God. The psalmist now commences the praise of Jehovah in his own person, acting as spokesman for his people; and first of all declares his Godhead; next, his universal dominion. His judgments are in all the earth; i.e. \"his sentences, decrees, laws, have a universal range, and command the obedience of all men.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He hath remembered his covenant forever. Thirdly, the psalmist praises God's faithfulness. God entered into a covenant with Israel, and that covenant still holds good. He has not forgotten it, and will never forget it. It is the word which he commanded to a thousand generations (comp. Deuteronomy 7:9). Professor Cheyne concludes, from this passage, that the psalm was not written during the Captivity. But surely a captive in Babylon might have had faith enough to believe that God had not abolished, but only suspended, his covenant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Which covenant he made with Abraham (see Genesis 15:18). A promise was given even earlier (Genesis 12:14, 15); but it is not spoken of as a \"covenant.\" And his oath unto Isaac. The \"oath\" was originally sworn to Abraham (Genesis 22:16); but a further promise to \"perform the oath\" was given to Isaac (Genesis 26:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law (see Genesis 28:13). And to Israel; i.e. to Jacob, after he had given him the name of Israel (see Genesis 35:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan (see Genesis 13:15; Genesis 17:8; Genesis 26:3; Genesis 28:13). The lot of your inheritance; literally, the cord, or line, of your inheritance (comp. Psalm 78:55). The words are not found among the promises made to the patriarchs, but are perhaps regarded by the writer as implied in them. When the allotment of Canaan to the several tribes was made, recourse was doubtless had to the measuring line.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - When they were but a few men in number; literally, when they were men of number; i.e. when they could be easily counted. A few scores at the utmost, or, with their entire households, a few hundreds (Genesis 14:14; Genesis 33:1). Yea, very few, and strangers in it; i.e. \"in the land of Canaan\" (comp. Exodus 6:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - When they went from one nation to another. Abraham \"went from\" Ur of the Chaldees to Haran of the Syrians, from Haran to Canaan, from Canaan to Philistia, and once as far as Egypt. Isaac and Jacob were also wanderers, though not to the same extent. From one kingdom to another people. Chaldea, Philistia, and Egypt were \"kingdoms;\" the Syrians and Canaanites, \"peoples.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes. The reference is to the punishment inflicted on the Pharaoh of Abraham's time (Genesis 12:17), and on Abimelech of Gerar (Genesis 20:3, 7, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Saying, Touch not mine anointed; literally, mine anointed ones; i.e. those consecrated to my service, as were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And do my prophets no harm (comp. Genesis 20:7; Genesis 27:27-29 and 39, 40; 49:3-27). The actual words of this verse do not occur in Genesis, but they express the lesson which God's dealings with Pharaoh and Abimelech taught the kings and peoples.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Moreover he called for a famine upon the land. To \"call for a famine\" is the same thing as to create a famine. What God \"calls for\" immediately exists (see Genesis 1:3). \"The land\" intended is the land of Canaan. He brake the whole staff of bread (comp. Leviticus 26:26; Isaiah lit. 1). Bread is called a \"staff,\" as the great support of life. (For the severity of the famine in Canaan, see Genesis 41:1; Genesis 42:5; Genesis 43:1.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He sent a man before them, even Joseph. This is the real sense, though it is not fully expressed in the Hebrew. On the providential sending of Joseph into Egypt, see his own words, \"God did send me before you, to preserve life\" (Genesis 45:5). Who was sold for a servant (comp. Genesis 33:28, 36; Genesis 39:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron; rather, his soul entered into iron. In Genesis nothing more is said than that Joseph \"was bound\" in the prison (Genesis 40:3). But the psalmist knows what imprisonment was in those early times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUntil the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Until the time that his word came; i.e. \"came true,\" \"came to pass\" (comp. Deuteronomy 18:22; Jeremiah 17:15). Joseph's \"word came,\" when the chief butler was restored to favour, and the chief baker hanged (Genesis 40:20-22). The word of the Lord tried him. It is difficult to decide what \"word of the Lord\" is meant. Hengstenberg suggests \"the promise of the possession of Canaan.\" But this had not been made to him. Dean Johnson thinks that there is an \"implied promise\" to Joseph himself in Genesis 37:5, 9, etc. - a promise that he should be raised to an eminent rank above his brethren, and that it was this promise which, during the time of his affliction, \"tried\" or tested him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The king sent and loosed him (see Genesis 41:14). Even the ruler of the people. Pharaoh, ruler of the Egyptians. Let him go free; i.e. made him a free man, instead of a prisoner and a slave.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance (see Genesis 41:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - To bind his princes at his pleasure. The kings of Egypt were despots, and could imprison any subject. Joseph, as the Pharaoh's alter ego (Genesis 41:40, 44), would, of course, be able to do the same. And teach his senators wisdom. As being wiser than any of them (Genesis 41:38, 39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIsrael also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob. (For the conjunction of both names of the patriarch, see ver. 10. For the journey of the Patriarch from Canaan into Egypt, see Genesis 46:1-7.) Sojourned in the land of Ham; or, was a sojourner. As a \"stranger\" and a \"sojourner,\" Jacob charged his sons not to bury him in Egypt, but in the land of Canaan, with his fathers (Genesis 49:29; Genesis 50:5). (For the use of the periphrasis, \"land of Ham,\" instead of Egypt, see below, ver. 27; and comb. Psalm 106:22.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And he increased his people greatly (comp. Exodus 1:7, 12, 20). And made them stronger than their enemies. So the Pharaoh who introduced the hard bondage, \"The people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we\" (Exodus 1:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - He turned their heart to hate his people. Not by direct action on their heart, but by prospering Israel until their jealousy was stirred. To deal subtilly with his servants (comp. Exodus 1:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He sent Moses his servant. The mission of Moses is related in Exodus 3:10-18; Exodus 4:1-9. And Aaron whom he had chosen. (For Aaron's mission, see Exodus 4:14-17.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - They showed his signs among them; literally, the matters of his signs; i.e. his long series of signs. Aaron showed the earlier signs generally (Exodus 7:10, 19, 20; Exodus 8:6, 17), Moses the later ones (Exodus 9:10, 23; Exodus 10:13, 22). And wonders in the land of Ham (comp. ver. 23 and Psalm 106:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - He sent darkness, and made it dark (see Exodus 10:21-23). And they rebelled not against his word. If the \"not\" is to stand in this passage, it must be referred to Moses and Aaron. Professor Cheyne, however, following the Septuagint and Peshito versions, boldly cancels the \"not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish (comb.

The 'arob is now generally thought to be either the dog fly (κυνόμυια, LXX.) or some sort of beetle (see the comment on Exodus 8:21). And lice in all their coasts; rather, gnats (see on Exodus 8:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - He gave them hail for rain (see Exodus 9:23).

The hail \"smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field\" (Exodus 9:25; comb. Psalm 78:47). The sceptical objection that Egypt had no vines has long been given up. And brake the trees of their coasts. Hail, though it cannot \"break\" trees of any size, may do great damage to the leaves and the smaller branches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He spake, and the locusts came (see Exodus 10:13, 14). And caterpillars. Either a kind of locust, or the locust at one period of its growth. Not mentioned in Exodus. And that without number (see Exodus 10:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground (comp.

The chief of all their strength (comp. Psalm 78:51).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - He brought them forth also with silver and gold (Exodus 12:35, 36; comp. 3:21, 22). And there was not one feeble person among their tribes; literally, there was not one that stumbled among their tribes, or among his tribes. Probably there were many feeble persons, who were carried on beasts of burden, or in carts, or by their friends. But all those who walked had strength given to them, and did not stumble by the way (comp. Isaiah 5:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEgypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Egypt was glad when they departed (see Exodus 11:1, 8; Exodus 12:31, 33). For the fear of them fell upon them. The Egyptians \"were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men\" (Exodus 12:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - He spread a cloud for a covering. The \"pillar of the cloud\" is intended. It was a \"covering\" to the Israelites on the night of the passage of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:19, 20), and perhaps also to some extent in the wilderness, when it may have sheltered them from the sun's rays (Hengstenberg); but its main purpose was to direct them on their way (Exodus 14:21), to tell them when to move and when to step, and how long to stop (Exodus 40:36-38). And fire to give light in the night. By night the \"pillar of the cloud\" became a \"pillar of fire,\" shedding a certain radiance around, and giving the people under all circumstances sufficient light (Exodus 13:21; Exodus 40:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - The people asked, and he brought quails; literally, they asked (comp. Exodus 16:3, 13; Numbers 11:31). And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. The \"bread of heaven\" is the manna, which was given to the Israelites continuously from their first encampment in the wilderness of Sin (Exodus 16:14, 15) to their first Passover in Canaan (Joshua 5:12). The quails seem to have been given only twice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out (see Exodus 17:5, 6, and Numbers 20:8-11). They ran in the dry places like a river. A poetical exaggeration of Numbers 20:11, \"The water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham; i.e. his covenant with Abraham to bring his seed into the Holy Land. His servant (comp. ver. 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness. The \"bringing forth\" intended is that of the Israelites from the wilderness into Canaan. It was naturally attended with much \"joy\" and \"gladness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm105:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - And gave them the lands of the heathen (see Joshua 8-12.). And they inherited the labour of the people; rather, of the peoples (comp.

Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. This was God's purpose. How far Israel was from carrying it out appears from the historical books generally, and perhaps still more from the writings of the prophets (see 2 Kings 17:7-23; 2 Chronicles 36:14-17; Isaiah 1:2-23; Jeremiah 2:5-37; Hosea 4:1-18, etc.). Praise ye the Lord (comp.

O give thanks unto the Lord (so in Psalm 105:1). Even in their greatest afflictions, the Israelites were bound to give God thanks. His mercies always exceeded his punishments. For he is good (see the comment on Psalm 100:5). For his mercy eudureth forever. According to Chronicles, this phrase was used at the dedication of David's tabernacle (1 Chronicles 16:34, 41), and again at the dedication of the temple (2 Chronicles 5:13). It here first occurs in the Psalms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? (comp. Psalm 50:2; and for the impossibility of expressing God's greatness, see Job 11:7-9; Psalm 92:5; Isaiah 40:12-17; Romans 11:33-36). Who can show forth all his praise? i.e. \"all the praise really due to him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. No distinction of meaning is intended between \"keeping judgment\" and \"doing righteousness.\" The second clause merely repeats the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Remember me, O Lord, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people. A prayer for individual blessing, not very usual in a psalm concerned with national sins and national deliverances. Professor Cheyne compares the parenthetic utterances of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 5:19; Nehemiah 13:14, 22, 31), but doubts whether the entire passage (vers. 4, 5) is not an interpolation. O visit me with thy salvation (comp. Psalm 18:35; Psalm 85:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That I may see the good of thy chosen; or, the good fortune, the prosperity, of thy chosen; i.e. their happiness when they are released from the captivity, and return to their own land (comp. ver. 47). That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation; i.e. \"the gladness\" that would be theirs when re-established in their own country (see Ezra 3:12; Ezra 6:22). That I may glory with thins inheritance; or, triumph.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-46. - The psalmist now enters on his main subject - the transgressions of Israel in the past, and God's manifold mercies vouchsafed to them. These he traces from the time of the Exodus (ver. 7) to that of the Babylonish captivity (ver. 46). Verse 6. - We have sinned with our fathers (comp. Leviticus 26:40; 1 Kings 8:47; Ezra 9:6, 7; Nehemiah 1:6, 7; Nehemiah 9:16-18, 26; Daniel 9:5-8). We have committed iniquity; or, \"dealt perversely\" (Kay). We have done wickedly. The confession is as broad and general as possible, including all under sin - the \"fathers\" from Moses downwards, the whole nation from the time of its settlement in Canaan, and even the afflicted exiles in Babylon. Their guilt is emphaized by the use of three verbs, each more forcible than the last.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; rather, considered not - did not give serious thought to them; took them as matters of course, and so were not impressed by them. They remembered not the multitude of thy mercies (comp. Psalm 69:16; Isaiah 63:7; Lamentations 3:32; and infra, ver. 45). But provoked him; rather, were rebellious (see the Revised Version). At the sea, even at the Red Sea (comp. Exodus 14:11, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Nevertheless he saved them for his Name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. (On this motive for the mighty works done in Egypt, see Exodus 7:5; Exodus 14:4, 18; Exodus 15:11-16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He rebuked the Red Sea also (comp. Psalm 104:7, \"At thy rebuke they [i.e. the waters] fled;\" see also Isaiah 50:2; Nahum 1:4). The Hebrew poets constantly represent God's dealings with inanimate nature in terms proper to his dealings with his rational creatures, thus personifying material things. And it was dried up (see Exodus 14:21, 22). So he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness (comp. Isaiah 63:13). Midbar, the word translated \"wilderness,\" is properly a smooth stretch of down, very level, and suited for sheep walks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them. The Pharaoh of the Exodus, whose \"hatred\" had been shown by his oppression (Exodus 2:23; Exodus 3:9; Exodus 5:6-19), his prolonged refusal to let Israel go, and final pursuit of them, and attempt to destroy them on the western shore of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:5-10). And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. The deliverance from Egypt, typifying man's deliverance from sin, is constantly spoken of as a \"redemption\" (Psalm 74:2; Psalm 107:2; Exodus 6:6, 7; Exodus 15:16, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the waters covered their enemies (see Exodus 14:28-30; Exodus 15:10). There was not one of them left. The words of Exodus 14:28 (last clause) are almost exactly followed. (On the true meaning of the expression, see the 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus 14, p. 314.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen believed they his words; they sang his praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Then believed they his words. So in Exodus 14:31, \"The people feared the Lord and believed the Lord\" - believed, that is, when they could no longer disbelieve. They sang his praise. The allusion is to the \"Song of Moses\" (Exodus 15:1-18), in which the Israelites generally joined (Exodus 15:1, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They soon forgat his works; literally, they hasted and forgat his works. Their gratitude and devotion were short-lived. They almost immediately forgot the omnipotence and extreme goodness of God towards them. They \"murmured\" at Marah (Exodus 15:24), complained in the wilderness of Sin (Exodus 16:3), \"lusted\" (Numbers 11:4), \"tempted God,\" etc. They waited not for his counsel; i.e. \"they did not wait for the development of God's plans respecting them, preferring (ver. 43) their own counsel\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness; literally, \"lusted a lust.\" The expression is taken from Numbers 11:4, where it is translated in the Authorized Version by \"fell a-lusting.\" The lust was for \"flesh,\" and for \"the fish, the cucumbers, the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic, which they did eat in Egypt freely\" (Numbers 11:5). And tempted God in the desert (comp. Psalm 78:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And he gave them their request. By sending the quails (Numbers 11:31, 32). But sent leanness into their soul. By \"leanness\" is meant dissatisfaction or disgust. After eating freely of the quails for a full month, the food became \"loathsome\" to them (Numbers 11:20). Whether it actually produced the pestilence which followed (Numbers 11:33). or whether that was a separate and distinct affliction, it is impossible to determine (compare, on the whole subject, Psalm 78:18-31, and the comment ad loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They envied Moses also in the camp. The writer passes now to the sin of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their followers, which was \"envy\" or jealousy of the high position assigned by God himself (Exodus 3:10; Exodus 4:1-17) to Moses and Aaron (comp. Numbers 16:1-3). These \"gainsayers\" (Jude 1:11) maintained that they had as much right to be priests as Moses and Aaron, since \"all the congregation was holy\" (Numbers 16:3). And Aaron the saint of the Lord; or, the holy one. It is rather Aaron's official sanctity (Leviticus 8:2-12) than his personal holiness that is intended. (Compare the use of the phrase \"man of God\" in 1 Kings 13:1, 4, 6, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan (see Numbers 16:31-33). And covered the company of Abiram. It is asked why there is no mention of Korah here, and suggested that he owed his escape from mention to the favouritism of the Levitical \"temple poets\" (Cheyne). But the real reason seems to be that Korah was not \"swallowed up;\" he and his company were destroyed by fire, and are alluded to in ver. 18 (so Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And a fire was kindled in their company (see Numbers 16:35, 40; Numbers 26:10). The flame burned up the wicked. Korah and his \"company\" were more \"wicked\" than Dathan, Abiram, and their followers, since they had received a favour from God which ought to have satisfied them (Numbers 16:9, 10), and since they ought to have been better instructed in the Law than ordinary Israelites. Hence Korah alone is mentioned in Jude 1:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They made a calf in Horeb (comp. Exodus 32:4; Deuteronomy 9:8-16). And worshipped the molten image; rather, a molten image (comp. Exodus 32:4, 24; Deuteronomy 9:12, 16). The sin was not only against the light of nature, but was expressly forbidden by the second commandment (Exodus 20:4, 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass; i.e. they exchanged the spiritual revelation of Jehovah, in all his glorious attributes, for a material emblem, which would naturally suggest low and unworthy thoughts of the supreme Being. So Schultz and Cheyne. The expression, \"an ox that eateth grass,\" emphasizes the contempt of the writer for a people who could so act. He has, probably, in his thoughts not only the golden calf, but the Apis bulls of Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They forgat God their Saviour (comp. ver. 13). \"God their Saviour\" is \"God who had so recently saved them out of the hands of Pharaoh.\" Which had done great things in Egypt. The allusion is principally to the long series of \"plagues.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Wondrous works in the land of Ham (comp. Psalm 78:51; Psalm 105:23, 27, for the expression \"land of Ham;\" and for the \"works\" themselves, see Exodus 7-12). And terrible things by the Red Sea (see Exodus 14:24, 27-30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Therefore he said that he would destroy them; literally, and he said. On the apostasy at Sinai, God expressed to Moses an intention to destroy the entire people of Israel, save only himself, and to \"make of him a great nation\" (Exodus 32:10; comp. Deuteronomy 9:14, 25). Had not Moses his chosen steed before him in the breach. Moses was \"chosen\" by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt (Exodus 3:10), and forced to accept the office (Exodus 4:1-17). When Israel angered God at Sinai, he \"stood in the gap,\" like a brave soldier guarding his city when the enemy has breached the wall (Exodus 32:11-13, 31-34). To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. God was ready to have destroyed all Israel, and to have raised up a new Israel out of the descendants of Moses, had not Moses pleaded with extreme earnestness on the people's behalf (Exodus 32:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Yea, they despised the pleasant land. The psalmist passes to the consideration of another sin. After the ill report of the spies (Numbers 13:27-33), the Israelites \"despised\" the land promised to them (Numbers 14:31), and relinquished all desire for it. They were ready to have turned back into Egypt (Numbers 14:3). They believed not his word; i.e. his promise to give them the land (Genesis 15:18-21; Exodus 23:31, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But murmured in their tents. The \"murmuring\" intended is undoubtedly that mentioned in Numbers 14:1-4. The phraseology employed is from Deuteronomy 1:27. And hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord; i.e. hearkened not to the many promises which God had made to drive out the Canaanitish nations before them (Exodus 3:17; Exodus 6:8; Exodus 15:15-17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Therefore he lifted up his hand against them (comp. Numbers 14:30, marginal rendering). The phrase is used with reference to the uplifting of the hand width accompanied an oath. To overthrow them in the wilderness (see Numbers 14:29, 32, 37). The death in the wilderness of the entire generation which had set out from Egypt, save only Joshua and Caleb, is the \"overthrow\" intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - To overthrow their seed also among the nations. Like Ezekiel (Ezekiel 20:23), the writer regards the Babylonish captivity as in part a punishment for the sins committed in the wilderness. And to scatter them in the lands (comp. Leviticus 26:33; Deuteronomy 28:64). The Israelites were punished, not merely by being carried into captivity, but by being completely broken up as a nation, and \"scattered\" widely over Western Asia - some in Gozan and on the Khabonr (2 Kings 17:6), some in Haran (1 Chronicles 5:26), some in \"the cities of the Modes\" (2 Kings 18:11; Tobit 1:14 Tobit 3:7), others in Babylonia (2 Kings 24:14-16; 2 Chronicles 36:20; Ezekiel 1:1-3, etc.). The \"scattering\" has in later times increased ever more and more.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor (see Numbers 25:3). The exact expression used in the Pentateuch is repeated. It signifies a mystic union, such as was supposed to exist between a heathen god and his worshippers, and to be kept up by sacrificial meals and the like. \"Baal-peor\" - i.e. \"the Lord of Pehor\" - is probably identified with Chemosh. And ate the sacrifices of the dead. The corresponding phrase in Numbers (Numbers 25:2) is, \"the sacrifices of their gods,\" who were \"dead,\" as opposed to the true living God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions; or, with their doings. And the plague; rather, a plague. Brake in upon them. The judicial slaughter inflicted by command of Moses (Numbers 25:4-8) is called here, as it is also in Numbers 25:8, 9, 18, \"a plague.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment (see Numbers 25:7, 8). Some critics, however, translate יפלל, by \"mediated\" (Kay, Cheyne). And so the plague was stayed (comp. Numbers 25:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And that was counted unto him for righteousness (comp. Numbers 25:11-13, and see also Ecclesiastes 45:23, 24; 1 Macc. 2:26, 54). Unto all generations forevermore. The praise awarded to Phinehas, here and in Numbers 25, is an everlasting testimony to him, though the \"everlasting priesthood\" of Numbers 25:13 has passed away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - They angered him also at the waters of strife; or, \"at the waters of Meribah\" (Revised Version, Kay, Cheyne); comp. Numbers 20:2, 10, 13. So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes. Moses was not punished for the people's sin, but for his own sin (Numbers 20:10-12), to which theirs led. The expression, \"for their sakes,\" is used loosely (comp. Deuteronomy 1:37; Deuteronomy 3:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. One man's sin often leads to another's, but does not necessitate it. The people \"provoked Muses' spirit\" by their murmurs and reproaches (Numbers 20:3-5). Moses, being provoked, made his rash utterance (Numbers 20:10). He was vexed, impatient, carried away by a gust of passion, and made the unfitting speech, \"Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of the rock?\" speaking as if the power were his own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them. This is reckoned as another sin. Israel, once comfortably settled in Palestine, with sufficient room for its numbers, did not carry out the Divine command to \"destroy,\" or \"cast out,\" the Canaanitish nations, but was content to share the land with them. \"The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem\" (Judges 1:21); \"neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns; nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns\" (Judges 1:27); \"neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer\" (Judges 1:29); nor \"Zebulon the inhabitants of Kitten, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol\" (Judges 1:30); \"neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho\" (Judges 1:31); nor \"Naphtali the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath\" (Judges 1:33); nor Dan the Amorites, who \"would dwell in Mount Heros in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim\" (Judges 1:35). It was not compassion that restrained them, but love of ease, idleness, one of the seven deadly sins; and the results were those described in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. This was the effect of the continuous contact. \"Evil communications corrupted good manners.\" The command to exterminate, which to moderns seems so terribly severe, and almost cruel, was undoubtedly based upon God's foreknowledge of the fact, that otherwise there would be contact, and if contact, then contamination. (For the actual fact, see Judges 2:11-13, 19; Judges 3:6, 7; Judges 6:25; Judges 10:6, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them; or, which became a snare unto them. The idols worshipped were especially Baal and Ashtoreth - the nature-god and nature-goddess, sometimes identified with the sun and moon. These alone are mentioned in the time of the Judges. Afterwards, however, Chemosh, Molech, Remphan, the gods of Syria, and perhaps Ammon of Egypt, were added to the catalogue (1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 21:19; 2 Chronicles 28:23; Acts 7:43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils. The Moloch sacrifices of children by their parents are evidently intended (comp. Leviticus 18:21; Deuteronomy 18:10; 2 Kings 3:27; Jeremiah 7:31; Ezekiel 23:37, etc.). (For the identification of the false gods of the heathen with \"devils,\" comp. Leviticus 17:71; Deuteronomy 32:17; 2 Chronicles 11:15; 1 Corinthians 10:20, 21.) It is argued by some that the use of the word \"devils,\" or \"demons,\" here does not imply that the objects of the worship were evil spirits. But it is difficult to see what else can be meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters. Infants, who could have committed no actual sin, were the ordinary victims in the Moloch sacrifices (see Jarchi on Jeremiah 7:31; Diod. Sic., 20:14; Dollinger, 'Judenthum und Heidenthum,' 1:427, Engl. trans.). Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan. Bloody offerings of this horrible kind were made, not only to Moloch, but also to Baal (Jeremiah 19:5), to Chemosh (2 Kings 3:27), and perhaps to other deities. And the land was polluted with blood. Contrary to the commandment given in Deuteronomy 35:33, \"Ye shall not pollute the laud wherein ye are.\" The \"innocent blood\" shed in the land is often declared to have been the especial cause of God's anger against Israel, and of his final casting away of his inheritance (2 Kings 24:4; Isaiah 59:7; Jeremiah 7:6; Jeremiah 22:3, 17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Thus were they defiled with their own works. The heathen \"works,\" which they adopted from them (ver. 35), had become \"their own works,\" and made them a \"defiled\" and \"polluted\" people. And went a-whoring with their own inventions; i.e. \"became spiritually adulterous,\" deserted God, and were unfaithful to him (comp. Ezekiel 23:2-21; Hosea 2:2-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people (comp. Psalm 78:58, 59). Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance (see Psalm 78:62). It justly increased God's anger that the sinners were his own people, his own inheritance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And he gave them into the hand of the heathen. This is the great lesson taught by Jewish history, and especially impressed upon us by Judges and Chronicles. When a nation sins, it is delivered over to its enemies, partly for punishment, partly to lead it to repentance. Israel was delivered into the hand, first, of Mesopotamia (Judges 3:10), then of Moab (Judges 3:12), next of the Philistines (Judges 3:31), then of the Canaanites (Judges 4:2), later on of Midian (Judges 6:1), still later of Ammon (Judges 10:7-18), and then of the Philistines once more (Judges 13:1) - on each occasion because of some flagrant sins, and suffered chastisement until it repented. So we are told in Chronicles with respect to the invasions of Shishak (2 Chronicles 12:2-5), of Pul (1 Chronicles 5:25, 26), of Tiglath-pileser (2 Chronicles 28:19, 20), and of Nebuchadnezzar (2 Chronicles 36:13-17), that they were on account of the people's transgressions. God \"slew\" them that they might \"seek him,\" and the ordinary result was, that they \"turned themselves, and inquired after God.\" And they that hated them ruled over them. Chushan-rishathaim for eight years (Judges 3:8), Eglon for eighteen (Judges 3:14), Jabin for twenty (Judges 4:3), the Midianites for seven (Judges 6:1), the Ammonites for eighteen (Judges 10:8), the Philistines for forty (Judges 13:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Their enemies also oppressed them (see Judges 4:3; Judges 10:8; 1 Samuel 9:16; etc.). And they were brought into subjection under their hand. (For pictures of the \"subjection,\" see Judges 4:6-11; 1 Samuel 13:19, 20.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Many times did he deliver them. By Othniel (Judges 3:9), by Ehud (Judges 3:15-29), by Shamgar (Judges 3:31), by Deborah and Barak (Judges 4:4-24), by Gideon (Judges 7:19-25), by Jephthah Judges 11:12-33), by Samson (Judges 15. (8-20), and finally by David (2 Samuel 5:22 - 25). But they provoked him with their counsel; rather, they were rebellious in their counsel (see the Revised Version). And were brought low for their iniquity; rather, in their iniquity (comp.

When he heard their cry. As God \"heard the cry\" of his people, when they suffered oppression in Egypt (Exodus 2:23; Exodus 3:7, 9), so also in their other oppressions (Judges 3:9, 15; Judges 4:3; Judges 6:6; Judges 10:10; 1 Samuel 12:10, 11, etc), if they did but humble themselves and \"cry\" to him, he always hearkened and gave them deliverance (1 Chronicles 5:20; 2 Chronicles 12:7; 2 Chronicles 14:11, 12; 2 Chronicles 20:4-24; 2 Chronicles 32:20, 21; 2 Chronicles 33:11-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - And he remembered for them his covenant. According to the promise in Leviticus 26:42. And repented according to the multitude of his mercies (comp. Exodus 32:14; 2 Samuel 24:16; 1 Chronicles 21:15; Jeremiah 26:19, etc.). The expression is anthropomorphic, and must be understood so as not to clash with the declaration, \"God is not a man, that he should repent\" (1 Samuel 15:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. Solomon had prayed that so it might be (1 Kings 8:50). The fact that compassion was shown to many of the captives appears from 2 Kings 25:27-30; Daniel 1:3-5, 19; Daniel 2:49; Daniel 3:30; Daniel 6:28; Ezra 1:4-6; Nehemiah 1:11; Nehemiah 2:1-8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - The historical portion of the psalm here ends, and the writer, in a brief epilogue, returns to the topic of prayer (see vers. 4, 5), only substituting now for the personal supplications of the prologue, a general prayer for the entire nation, and especially for its deliverance from captivity. \"It can scarcely be doubted,\" as Dean Johnson well observes, \"that the words of ver. 47 refer to deliverance from the Babylonish captivity,\" which was the only one that involved the dispersion of the whole people, and the suspension of the liturgical offering of thanks and praise. Verse 47. - Save us, O Lord our God. Contrast with this the \"remember me\" of ver. 4. The review of the national history has quickened the psalmist's sympathies and widened them. Previously he prayed only for himself. Now it will not content him unless the people generally are \"saved.\" And gather us from among the heathen. (On the wide dispersion of the Israelites at the time of the Babylonian captivity, see the comment on ver. 27.) To give thanks unto thy holy Name, and to triumph in thy praise. This is spoken of as the consequence of the gathering together. Dispersion could not, of course, prevent the rendering of praise and thanks by individual Israelites (Daniel 6:10); but it had stopped the united liturgical expression of them. On the restoration of the Israelites to their own land, this was resumed (Ezra 3:2-11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm106:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. This verse is not so much a part of the particular psalm, as a mark that here another Book of the Psalms has reached its conclusion (comp. Psalm 41:13; Psalm 72:19; Psalm 89:52). The form has, however, been modified so as to make it run on smoothly with the verse immediately preceding. And let all the people say. In their praises and thanks to God (see ver. 47). Amen. Praise ye the Lord. The other terminal psalms end with \"Amen and Amen;\" here alone do we have \"Amen. Praise ye the Lord.\" the intention being evidently that the last words of the psalm should be an echo of the first (see ver. 1).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.107":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good (comp.

Isaiah 44:22-24; Isaiah 51:11; Jeremiah 31:11; Zechariah 10:8, etc.). The writer calls on them to give voice to the thanksgiving of ver. 1.

From the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. The present Hebrew text has מִיָּם, \"from the sea\" and so the LXX., ἀπὸ θαλάσσης - but it is thought that probably מִיָּם is a corruption of מִיָּמִין (Cheyne), which would mean \"from the south.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-9. - The form is historical, but the intention is to describe a recurrent event. Men from time to time wander - lose their way - either literally, or in the wilderness of life, grow faint and weary, and are ready to perish. But if they cry to God, God gives them aid, succors them, saves them. Then let them praise and thank him. Verse 4. - They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in. It is, perhaps, best to divide this verse as was done by the LXX., who attached דרך, \"way,\" to the latter clause. So Cheyne, who translates, \"They wandered in the wilderness, yea, in the desert; they found no road to a city of habitation.\" So also Rosenmüller.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. Either actual hunger and thirst, or dissatisfaction with life, may be intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble (comp. Psalm 106:44, and the comment ad loc.). And he delivered them out of their distresses. \"Distresses\" may be a plural of amplification, or it may point to the triple suffering - hunger, thirst, faintness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And he led them forth by the right way; or, \"by a straight way\" - a way in which there was no crookedness. That they might go to a city of habitation. The same phrase as in ver. 4. A city suitable for habitation is meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness! Here the refrain occurs for the first time. Note its repetition in vers. 15, 21, and 31. It is an earnest call on those who have experienced God's mercies to be thankful. And for his wonderful works to the children of men! or, \"his wonderful doings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. The \"satisfaction\" intended seems to be spiritual rather than material (comp. Psalm 34:10; Luke 1:53). God alone can satisfy the cravings of man's spiritual nature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSuch as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-16. - There are others afflicted differently - struck down by some grievous calamity, imprisonment, earthly ruin, down fall of their hopes, a sense of their bondage to sin - who suffer perhaps even more than the dissatisfied wanderers. They too may cry to God in their trouble; and when they do, they experience his mercy. Let them join in the chorus of praise. Verse 10. - Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death (comp. Job 16:16; Job 36:8). The expressions used are purposely vague, being intended to cover various sorts of misery. Being bound in affliction and iron; i.e. \"in an affliction which holds them like bands of iron\" (comp. ver. 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Because they rebelled against the words of God. Such deep affliction as is here spoken of scarcely ever comes upon any but those who have offended God by resisting his will. And contemned the counsel of the most High (comp. Proverbs 1:25). The \"counsel of God\" is the course of conduct which he has prescribed to man, whether through the reason and conscience that he has implanted in him, or through his revealed Word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; rather, with misery, or with sorrow. They fell down; i.e. collapsed - sank to the earth. And there was none to help. They were like Job; no one gave them any help in their affliction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses (comp. ver. 6, and see also vers. 19 and 28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He brought them out of dark ness and the shadow of death.

Snaps fetters and prison bars.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-22. - A third class of persons under God's displeasure are punished by grievous sickness, and brought to the very verge of the grave. They, too, in many cases, turn to God, and, \"crying to him,\" are delivered from their peril. It is for them, under such circumstances, to make a return by means of praise and thanks giving. Verse 17. - Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. Some read חולִים, \"sick men,\" for ךאוִלִים, \"fools,\" here. But the change is not necessary. Folly and sin are regarded as two aspects of the same moral condition by the sacred writers, and sickness is spoken of as an ordinary punishment for them (Job 33:17-22; 2 Kings 5:27; 2 Chronicles 21:15; 2 Chronicles 26:16-19; Acts 12:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat (comp.

The \"word\" intended may be a message sent by a human messenger, like the \"word\" sent to Hezekiah in. his sickness (2 Kings 20:4; Isaiah 38:4); or it may be a thought suggested to the mind either directly by God, or by an angel, like that spoken of in Job 33:23, 24; or, lastly, it may be the actual Word of God (John 1:1), the Son, sent by the Father. But this last sense can scarcely have been in the writer's mind. And delivered them from their destructions; or, \"from their grave-pits\" (Kay, Cheyne). The word used occurs only here and in Lain. 4:20, where it is translated \"pits.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Oh that men, etc.!

And declare his works with rejoicing; i.e. joyfully pro claim the great things that God has done for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-32. - Finally, there are cases among those whose business requires them to traverse the sea, where the danger is great, and death seems imminent. Let such persons cast themselves upon God, and \"cry to him in their trouble,\" and they too will be heard and delivered. Must it not be their duty also to give thanks? Verse 23. - They that go down to the sea in ships. That many of the Israelites engaged in maritime pursuits appears from 1 Kings 9:26-28; 1 Kings 10:22; 1 Kings 22:48; 2 Chronicles 20:36; as also from Judges 5:17; Psalm 48:7; Proverbs 23:34; Proverbs 30:19; and from many passages of the Apocrypha. Joppa was at all times an Israelite port, from which trade was carried on by the residents (2 Chronicles 2:16; Ezra 3:7; Jonah 1:3). That do business in great waters; i.e. the sea of Galilee and Lake Merom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. Storms, tempests, and sudden deliverances are the \"wonders\" especially meant (comp.

Psalm 147:15, 18; Jonah 1:4). The operations of nature are constantly spoken of in Scripture as God's direct doing. Which lifteth up the waves thereof; or, \"the waves that are his\" (compare, in Psalm 147:17, 18, \"his ice, his cold, his wind\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths. Tossed on the foaming billows, now carried up until they seem almost to touch the sky (see Genesis 11:4), anon sinking into the trough of the sea, and as it were swallowed up in its depths. Their soul is melted because of trouble; or, \"their soul melteth away in the trouble\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man. The oldest sailor \"loses his sea-legs,\" and staggers about the deck like a landsman, or like one drunk. And are at their wit's end; literally, as in the margin, and all their wisdom is swallowed. But the English idiom of the Authorized Version is a very happy, one, and exactly expresses the writer's meaning. All the seaman's intelligence is at fault, and can suggest nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. Practically identical with vers. 6, 13, and 19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - He maketh the storm a calm; i.e. he causes the wind to drop, and to be succeeded by a \"great calm\" (comp. Matthew 8:26). Such sudden changes do sometimes occur, not only in inland seas, but on the Mediterranean (see Jonah 1:15). So that the waves thereof are still; literally, the waves of them; i.e. of the great waters (see ver. 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Then are they glad because they be quiet; or, \"because they be at rest,\" i.e. no longer tempest-tossed. So he bringeth them unto their desired haven; literally, the haven of their desire; i.e. the haven where they desire to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Oh that men, etc. Repeated from vers. 8, 15, and 21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people. The psalmist holds it to be not enough for men who have received deliverances to thank God in their hearts, or secretly in their chambers. He requires them to make public profession of their thankfulness \"in the congregation of the people.\" The Christian Church maintains the same attitude. And praise him in the assembly of the elders. The elders led the congregation and presided in it (Ezra 3:9-11; Ezra 6:16-22; Nehemiah 8:4-9; Nehemiah 9:4, 5; Nehemiah 12:27-43, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-42. - Professor Cheyne finds in this passage - which he views as an \"appendix\" to the psalm - a falling off from the earlier portion of the psalm, and a set of \"sentences strung together without much reflection.\" But to others the transition from special deliverances to God's general dealings with mankind seems an enlargement and an advance in the thought, although the language may be less graphic and more commonplace than in the former portion of the composition. Verse 33. - He turneth rivers into a wilderness. God can, and does, by the operation of his providence, turn lands naturally fertile - lands abounding with streams - into arid wastes, either by such a physical catastrophe as that which blasted the cities of the plain (Genesis 19:24, 25), or by such moral changes as have turned Babylonia from a garden into a desert, a miserable howling wilderness (comp. Isaiah 13:15-22; Isaiah 50:2; Jeremiah 50:13-15, 38-40; Jeremiah 51:13, 37-43, etc.). And the water springs into dry ground. The phrase is varied, but the meaning is the same. God has full control over nature, and can either take back his blessings, or render them of no avail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - A fruitful land into barrenness; literally, into saltness. The judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah is probably in the writer's mind. For the wickedness of them that dwell therein. God does not capriciously withdraw his blessings from a land. If he turns a fruitful land into a barren one, we may be sure that the inhabitants have provoked him by their sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - He turneth the wilderness into a standing water; rather, a wilderness (comp. Isaiah 35:7; Isaiah 41:18). And dry ground into water springs. The entire verse is antithetical to ver. 33.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And there he maketh the hungry to dwell. God gives the laud, which he has thus blessed, to some previously famishing people; as he did Canaan to Israel after they had had but scant fare in the wilderness. That they may prepare a city for habitation; literally, and they prepare. It is naturally their first thought to prepare themselves a settled dwelling-place (comp. Genesis 4:17; Genesis 11:4; Genesis 25:16, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - And sow the fields; literally, and sow fields - the first act of a settled population. And plant vineyards. The second act in a wine-producing country. Bread and wine were recognized in the East as the prime necessaries of life (see Genesis 14:18; Judges 9:13; Judges 19:19; 2 Samuel 6:19; Nehemiah 5:15; Psalm 104:15; Daniel 1:5, etc.). Which may yield fruits of increase; rather, and get them; literally, make them. The expression, \"fruits of increase,\" points to the abundance of the harvest and vintage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. With in creasing prosperity comes increase of population, naturally - i.e. by God's ordinary providence. This increase is, however, only a blessing within certain limits. And suffereth not their cattle to decrease. This modest under-statement suggests an enormous increase (comp. Job 42:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Again. There is no \"again\" in the original, but merely the usual yaw conjunctive. Still, in the thought, there is no doubt an abrupt transition. The writer turns to the darker side of the picture. They are minished and brought low. God shows his providence, not merely in blessing, but also in chastising. Even the very nation which has been the most highly favored may, by misconduct, fall under his displeasure and suffer at his hands. Their population is diminished; they arc \"bowed down\" (Revised Version), or \"brought low.\" Calamities of various kinds befall them. Sometimes their decline is brought about through oppression, which may be either the cruel rule of a native monarch, such as Saul, or the still heavier yoke of a foreign power, like Egypt or Babylon. Sometimes it comes from such an affliction as bad harvests, plagues of locusts, or pestilence. Sometimes it is brought about by sorrow - the death of a good ruler in the flower of his age, the extinction of a royal stock, the destruction of a nation's best and bravest on battle-fields, and the like. But in all calamities alike it is God's hand that deals the blow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - He poureth contempt upon princes. A direct quotation from Job 12:21, but not therefore to be regarded as spurious, since the sacred writers often quote one another, and the psalmists especially are very much in the habit of citing, or referring to Job (see, in this very psalm, besides the present passage, vers. 10, 18 (bis), 20, 34, 41, and 42). And causeth them to wander in the wilderness; rather, a wilderness (comp. Job 12:24). Where there is no way. \"Wandering in a wilder ness without a way denotes helpless embarrassment\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction. Even in such dread calamities, when a whole nation is punished, God's providence protects the poor and needy - not of course in all, but still in very many, cases. The mower's scythe passes over the humblest flowers. And maketh him families like a flock (setup. Job 21:11). Those whom God thus preserves he collects into \"families,\" and looks after as carefully as a shepherd looks after his sheep.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - The righteous shall see it, and rejoice. Experience will justify God's ways to man. \"The righteous\" - his people - will see that the general course of God's providence is such as described (vers. 33 - 41), and will \"rejoice\" that it is so. And all iniquity shall stop her mouth. The gain sayers, unable to impugn the righteousness of the Divine proceedings, shall have no resource but to sit still and hold their tongues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm107:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Whoso is wise, and will observe these things; rather, let him observe these things. It is assumed that they are open to be observed by all; they are the patent facts of human life. Even they; rather, and they.

In the original form (Psalm 57:7) this emphatic phrase was reiterated, which much increased the force of the declaration. I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

Identical with the first two clauses of Psalm 60:8. Over Philistia will I triumph. In Psalm 60:8 the expression used is different. There we have, \"Philistia, triumph thou over me,\" or, \"because of me.\" Apparently the compiler has not understood David's irony, and has therefore changed the form of the verb.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm108:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Who will bring me into the strong city?

The prayer occupies one verse only (ver. 1); the complaint four verses (vers. 2-5). Verse 1. - Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise (comp. Psalm 28:1; Psalm 35:22; Psalm 39:12). If God makes no sign when men arc grievously persecuted, he seems to be indifferent to their sufferings. Surely he will not thus treat one who praises him continually (Psalm 22:26; Psalm 71:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful; literally, of deceit - the abstract for the concrete. Are opened against me; literally, hare they opened upon me (Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). They have spoken against ms with a lying tongue (comp. Psalm 27:12; Psalm 35:11). Calumny and misrepresentation are ever the portion of the children of God. David was calumniated by Saul (1 Samuel 22:7-13), by Absalom (2 Samuel 15:3, 4), by Shimei (2 Samuel 16:8), and others. One more perfect than David was even more calumniated (Matthew 11:19; Matthew 12:24; Matthew 26:61; Luke 23:2, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They compassed me about also with words of hatred. The hatred of the wicked for the good is a plain fact of history, and quite indisputable. \"Words of hatred\" are less patent, since they are often restrained from prudential considerations. But sometimes free vent is given to them (see 2 Samuel 16:5-8). And fought against me without a cause (comp. Psalm 35:7, 19; Psalm 69:4; Psalm 119:161). Saul's hatred towards David was markedly of this character - un-provoked by either act or word from its object.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For my love they are my adversaries. The tenderness and kindness of the good towards wicked men does not soften them. Rather it provokes them to greater hostility. This was seen clearly in the instance of Saul. But I give myself unto prayer; literally, but I prayer; i.e. \"but I am wholly prayer,\" \"I do nothing during their attacks on me but pray for them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And they have rewarded ms evil for good, and hatred for my love; or, \"thus they rewarded me.\" The verse is a corollary from what has gone before, not anything additional.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSet thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-15. - The imprecatory portion of the psalm now begins. It is no doubt true to say, with Tholuck, that \"no passion is discernible in the imprecations, dreadful as they are.\" Clearly the writer is not moved by personal feelings of hostility, but by a spirit of justice, and an intense abhorrence of sin. He delivers a calm judicial sentence. Still, the spirit of Christian love must ever shrink from such utterances, which belong to an earlier and less perfect dispensation (comp. Luke 9:51-56). Verse 6. - Set thou a wicked man over him; i.e. to judge him (see ver. 7). A persecutor deserves to be himself persecuted, an oppressor to be himself oppressed. \"Nec lex justior ulla est, Quam necis artifices arte periresua.\" And let Satan stand at his right hand; rather, an adversary, or an accuser. In courts of justice the accuser stood at the accused person's right hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; literally, let him go forth condemned; Let him quit the court under sentence. And let his prayer become sin. The most terrible of all the imprecations. \"Let him even be unable to pray to God acceptably,\" and so let any prayer that he offers when he is brought low be an additional sin (comp. Proverbs 15:8; Proverbs 28:9; Isaiah 1:12-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet his days be few; and let another take his office.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Let his days be few. There were Divine promises that \"bloodthirsty and deceitful men\" should not \"live out half their days,\" which might naturally be regarded as justifying this wish (see Psalm 55:23; Proverbs 10:27; Ecclesiastes 7:17). And let another take his office. Τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, LXX.

If it be just that the sins of the fathers be visited upon the children, the psalmist may be regarded as justified in this wish. Still, it is not one that a Christian will readily echo. Let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places. Professor Cheyne corrects דָרְשׁוּ into לֺגּדְשׁוּ, and translates, \"Let them be driven from their desolate houses.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; rather, the creditor, or the usurer; i.e. the man from whom he has borrowed money.

In his need, let none of his neighbors continue to show him mercy and loving-kindness. Let them stand aloof, and remain passive, while punishment overtakes him. Neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children. Let them too be suffered to endure the woes which come naturally upon them (see ver. 10) through their father's fault, without any one thinking it necessary, because they arc fatherless, to show them favor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Let his posterity be cut off. If he have children; let them die without offspring; literally, let them be for extinction. And in the generation following let their name be blotted out. This would be the natural result if the preceding wish were accomplished. The family having come to an end, their very name would be soon forgotten (comp. Job 18:18; Psalm 37:28; Proverbs 10:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord. Let the threatening of Exodus 20:5 take effect in his case, and the sins of his forefathers be remembered by God, and visited upon him. And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out; i.e. erased from God's remembrance. Let it also be visited on him, as Jezebel's was on her children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let them be before the Lord continually; i.e. let these sins be present to the mind of God constantly, that he may visit for them constantly, even to the bitter end; and so may cut off the memory of them (i.e. of the original sinners) from the earth (comp. ver. 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-20. - A portraiture of the wicked man, who was David's chief adversary at the time, is now given, in explanation, and perhaps in justification, of the numerous and severe anathemas. He was merciless (ver. 16), a persecutor of the poor (ver. 16), given to cursing (vers. 17, 18), and one who spoke evil against the innocent (ver. 20). Verse 16. - Because that he remembered not to show mercy. Saul certainly was a persecutor of this kind - implacable; one whom compassion never touched; who, after he had once become David's enemy, never under any circumstances showed him mercy. But otherwise the description scarcely seems to point to Saul. But persecuted the poor and needy man (see 1 Samuel 18:10; 1 Samuel 19:1, 10, 11; 1 Samuel 20:31; 1 Samuel 23:8, 14, 25; 1 Samuel 24:2; 1 Samuel 26:2-20; 1 Samuel 27:1, etc.). That he might even slay the broken in heart; literally, and the broken in heart (or, yea, the broken in heart) to slay him. It was certainly Saul's object to slay David (1 Samuel 18:11; 1 Samuel 19:1, 10; 1 Samuel 20:1, etc.). It was probably also Ahithophel's (2 Samuel 17:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him; rather, so it came upon him (Revised Version), or so it shall come upon him (LXX., Cheyne). The one of David's enemies who \"loved cursing\" most was Shimei (2 Samuel 16:5-12). As he de lighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him; rather, so it was, or so it will be, far from him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment (comp. Psalm 10:7; Psalm 59:12; Psalm 62:4). Extreme malevolence vents itself in curses, which tend to become frequent, and, so to speak, habitual. So let it come; rather, so it cams, or so it will come. Into his bowels like water. Dr. Kay sees here an allusion to the \"water of cursing\" which was drunk by the woman whose husband taxed her with unfaithfulness (Numbers 5:22); and so also Hengstenberg. But this is doubtful. Perhaps the mere penetrative power of water is alluded to. See the next clause. And like oil into his bones. The oil, wherewith it was usual to anoint the frame, was believed to penetrate, not only into the tissues, but into the very bones and marrow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him. Let it cling to him both outwardly and inwardly - inwardly, as the penetrating oil; outwardly, as the everyday dress. And for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually. The \"girdle\" or \"waistcloth\" was even more inseparable from the wearer than his beged, his \"cloak\" or \"wrap.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the Lord; rather, this is the reward, or the wages. This is what their conduct has earned, and what they have received, or assuredly will receive. And of them that speak evil against my soul (see above, ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-29. - The psalmist now turns to God in prolonged prayer, setting forth his needs (vers. 22-25), and entreating for help (ver. 26), deliverance (ver. 21), blessing (ver. 28), and triumph over his enemies (ver. 29). Verse 21. - But do thou for me; or, \"deal thou with me\" (see the Revised Version). O God the Lord; literally, Jehovah the Lord, as in Psalm 68:20; Psalm 140:7; Psalm 141:8; Habakkuk 3:19. For thy Name's sake; i.e. suitably to thy Name - according to thy historically manifested attributes. Because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me. A variant echo of the preceding clause (comp. Psalm 69:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For I am poor and needy (comp. ver. 16). David was \"poor and needy\" both when hunted upon the mountains by Saul, and when forced to flee from Absalom. And my heart is wounded within me. The wound to David's heart was, on the former occasion, from the malignity of Saul; on the latter, especially from the desertion of his \"own familiar friend whom he trusted.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I am gone like the shadow when it declineth; rather, lille a shodow (comp. Psalm 102:11). When shadows \"decline,\" they are just about to cease and disappear. I am tossed up and down as the locust; or, \"I am carried away\" - swept off, i.e., or just ready to be swept off, from the face of the earth (see Exodus 10:19; Joel 2:20; Nahum 3:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - My knees are weak through fasting. I have brought myself down to extreme weakness by penitential fasting for my sins (comp. Psalm 35:13; Psalm 69:10). And my flesh faileth of fatness; literally, of oil. In my state of mourning and penitence I have abstained from anointing myself (2 Samuel 14:2), which has still further weakened me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I became (rather, am become) also a reproach unto them; i.e. to my enemies. I am an object of their reproach and scorn. When they looked upon me they shaked their heads. In derision (comp.

What matters it? Provided only that thou blessest.\" When they arise. When they attempt to put their malevolent designs in act. Let them be ashamed; or, \"they shall be ashamed\" (Revised Version); i.e. they shall fail so utterly, that they shall be covered with shame. But let thy servant rejoice; rather, but thy servant shall rejoice. \"Thy servant\" is the psalmist himself (comp. Psalm 69:17). He will rejoice at their failure, which secures his safety.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame; rather, my adversaries shall be clothed with shame. \"The prayer is now, in conclusion, changed into a confident expectation\" (Dean Johnson). And let them (rather, and shall) cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle (comp. ver. 18). Instead of the \"cursing\" with which the wicked delighted to clothe themselves, they shall be forced to wear a covering of shame and confusion of face.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - The psalm terminates with a short burst of praise, the writer feeling assured that his prayer is granted, and that he will shortly triumph over his enemies. Verse 30. - I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth. The expression \"greatly praise\" does not occur elsewhere in the Psalms. It is indicative of an unusually strong feeling of thankfulness. Yea, I will praise him among the multitude; i.e. in the congregation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm109:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor. God will always come to the assistance of the poor and needy, when unrighteous men oppress them, and will give them help and deliverance. To save him from those that condemn his soul. The salvation is not always from the death of the body, or there could have been no martyrs; but in all cases it is a deliverance of the soul.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? Here is the key-note struck at once. Why does God stand aloof? Why, after delivering his people from their foreign foes, does he not interfere to protect his true people from their domestic oppressors? \"Throughout the reign of David,\" as it has been truly observed, \"Palestine was infested by brigands, and disturbed by a factious nobility\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 191). Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? \"Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself,\" says Isaiah (Isaiah 45:15). And so Job complains, \"He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him\" (Isaiah 23:9). He seems neither to see nor hear. The psalmist inquires - Why? It can only be answered, \"In his wisdom; for his own purposes; because he knows it to be best.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor. Dr. Kay translates, \"Through the pride of the wicked man the poor is set on fire;\" and our Revisers, \"In the pride of the wicked, the poor is hotly pursued;\" and so (nearly) the LXX., the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Kohler, Hengstenberg, and others. The Authorized Version paraphrases rather than translates; but it does not misrepresent the general sense, which is a complaint that the poor are persecuted by the wicked. Let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined (comp. Psalm 35:8, \"Let his net that he hath hid catch himself;\" and Psalm 141:10, \"Let the wicked fall into their own nets;\" see also Psalm 7:15, 16; Psalm 9:15; Proverbs 5:22; Proverbs 26:27: Ecclesiastes 10:8). Some, however, translate, \"They (i.e. the poor) are ensnared in the devices which they (i.e. the wicked) have imagined;\" and this is certainly a possible rendering. Hengstenberg regards it as preferable to the other \"on account of the parallelism and connection.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire; rather, for the wicked sings praise over his own soul's greed. Instead of praising God, he praises his *own greed and its success (comp. Her., 'Sat.,' 1:1. 66, \"At mihi plaudo ipse dotal, stimul ac nummos contemplor in area.\" And blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth; rather, and when he gets a gain blesses (but) despises the Lord (so Kay, Alexander, Cheyne, and Hengstenberg). Each time that he gets a gain, he says, \"Thank God!\" - but, in thanking God for an unjust gain, he shows that he despises him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. The construction is concise to abruptness, and it is hard to determine the ellipses. The passage in the original runs thus: \"The wicked, in the height of his scorn - will not require - no God - all his thoughts.' Of the various attempts to supply the ellipses, and obtain a satisfactory sense, the following (that of the 'Speaker's Commentary') is probably the best: \"As for the wicked in the height of his scorn - 'God will not require' - 'There is no God' - such are all his thoughts.\" (Compare the Revised Version, which is not very different.) The general sense is that his pride conducts the wicked man to absolute atheism, or at least to practiced atheism (comp. vers. 11, 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - His ways are always grievous; lather, firm; i.e. steadfast and consistent, not wavering and uncertain. The thoroughly wicked person who \"neither fears God nor regards man,\" pursues the course which he has set himself, without deviation, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left. There is nothing to hinder him - no qualm of conscience, no distrust of himself, no fear of other men's opposition. Thy judgments are far above out of his sight. They are held in reserve; he does not foresee them - he does not believe in them. As for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. His human adversaries he wholly despises, believing that a breath from his month will bring them to nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved (comp. Psalm 30:6). The idea of continuance is instinctive in the human mind. \"The thing that has been, it is that which shall be\" (Ecclesiastes 1:9). We expect the sun to rise each day, solely because in the past it has always risen (see Butler's 'Analogy,' part 1. ch. 1.). The wicked man, who has always prospered, expects to prosper in the future; he has no anticipation of coming change; he supposes that his \"house will continue for ever, and his dwelling-place to all generations' (Psalm 49:11); he thinks that \"to-morrow will be as to-day, and much more abundant\" (Isaiah 56:12). For I shall never be in adversity; rather, unto generation and generation, I am he who will be exempt from calamity. The wicked man has no thought of dying - he will be prosperous, he thinks, age after age.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - His mouth is full of cursing. (On the prevalence of this evil habit among the powerful in David's time, see Psalm 59:12; Psalm 109:17, 18; 2 Samuel 16:5.) And deceit and fraud; or, guile and extortion (Kay); comp. Psalm 36:3; Psalm 55:11. Under his tongue is mischief and vanity; rather, as in the margin, mischief and iniquity. These are stored \"under his tongue,\" ready for utterance whenever he finds a fit occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages. These \"lurking-places\" must not be supposed to have been inside the villages, but outside of them They were retired spots at no great distance, where brigands or others might lie in ambush, ready to seize on such of the villagers as might show themselves. In the secret places doth he murder the innocent (comp. Job 24:14). The usual object would be, not murder, but robbery. Still, there would be cases where it would be convenient to remove a man, as Jezebel removed Naboth; and moreover, in every case of robbery, there is a chance that the victim may resist, and a struggle ensue, in which he may lose his life. His eyes are privily set against the poor; or, his eyes lay ambush for the helpless (Kay). The word translated\" poor\" (הֵלְכָה) is only found in this place and in ver. 10, where the antithesis of \"strong ones\" seems to imply that the weak and helpless are meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den; or, he lurks in the covert as a lion in his lair (Kay) - a very striking image! He lieth in wait (or, lurks) to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net; rather, by drawing him into his net. The mode of capture is intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He croucheth, and humbleth himself; rather, crushed, he sinks down. The subject is changed, and the poor man's condition spoken cf. That the poor may fall by his strong ones; rather, and the helpless (comp. ver. 8)fall by his strong ones. The \"strong ones\" are the ruffians whom the wicked man employs to effect his purposes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten (comp. vers. 4, 13). \"The wish is father to the thought.\" As Delitzsch says, \"The true personal God would disturb his plans, so he denies him. ' There is naught,' he says, 'but destiny, and that is blind; an absolute, and that has no eyes; an idea, and that has no grasp.'\" He hideth his face. He looks away; he does not wish to be troubled or disturbed by what occurs on earth. So the Epicureans in later times. He win never see it (comp. Job 22:12; Psalm 73:11; Psalm 94:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Arise, O Lord (comp. Psalm 9:19). At this point the psalmist passes from description to invocation. From ver. 2 to the end of ver. 11 he has described the conduct, the temper, and the very inmost thoughts of the wicked. Now he addresses himself to God - he summons God to arise to vengeance. As Hengetenberg says, \"Here the second part begins - prayer, springing out of the lamentation which has preceded;\" prayer and invocation, beginning here, and terminating at the close of ver. 15. O God, lift up thine hand; i.e. to strike, to take vengeance on the wicked. Forget not the humble; or, the afflicted. Do not justify the hidden thought of the wicked (ver. 11), that thou forgettest - show that thou rememberest at once the sufferings of the afflicted, and the guilt of their oppressors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? God's long-suffering does but make the wicked despise him. Wherefore is this allowed to continue (comp. ver. 1)? He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it; rather, as in the Prayer-beck Version, while he cloth say in his heart (see vers. 6, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou hast seen it. The most emphatic contradiction that was possible to the wicked man's \"He will never see it\" (ver. 11). God sees, notes, bears in mind, and never forgets, every act of wrong-doing that men commit, and especially acts of oppression. For thou beholdest mischief and spite; or, perhaps, mischief and grief (see Job 6:2); i.e. the \"mischief\" of the oppressors, and the \"grief' of the oppressed. (so Hengstenberg, Cheyne, and the' Speaker's Commentary'). Others refer both words to the feelings of the oppressed, and translate, \"travail and grief.\" To requite it with thy hand. Again the Prayer-book Version is preferable, \"to take the matter into thy hand,\" both for reward and requital. The poor committeth himself unto thee. He has no other possible refuge - therefore no other reliance. Thou art the Helper of the fatherless. The word \"thou\" is emphatic - \"Thou, and no other (אַתָּה).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBreak thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man; i.e. \"break thou his strength; take away his ability to work evil to others.\" Seek out his wickedness till thou find none; rather, require his wickedness. The verb is the same as that used in the last clause of ver. 13. The wicked man had said in his heart, \"Thou wilt not require;\" the psalmist calls on God, not only to require, but to require to the uttermost. Seek out, be says, require, and bring to judgment, all his wickedness - every atom of it - until even thy searching eye can find no mere to require, requite, and punish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-18. - Here begins the third part of the psalm. It is, as has been observed, \"confident and triumphant.\" The psalmist has, in the first part, shown the wickedness of the ungodly; in the second, he has prayed for vengeance on them, and for the deliverance of their victims; in the third, he expresses his certainty that his prayer is heard, and that the punishment and deliverance for which he has prayed are as good as accomplished. Verse 16. - The Lord is King for ever and ever (comp. Psalm 29:10; Psalm 146:10). Thus God's kingdom is established, his authority vindicated, his absolute rule over all men made manifest. Internal and external foes are alike overcome. The heathen - whether uncircumcised in the flesh or in the heart (Jeremiah 9:25, 26) - are perished out of his (Jehovah's) land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble (comp. Psalm 9:12). It is not the psalmist's prayer alone that he regards as heard and answered. The oppressed have cried to God against their oppressors, and their cry has \"come before him, and entered into his ears.\" Thou wilt prepare their heart; rather, thou dost establish (or, make firm) their heart. Through their conviction that thou art on their side, and art about to help them. Thou wilt cause thine ear to hear; or, thou causest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - To judge the fatherless (see ver. 14) and the oppressed; i.e. to vindicate them - to judge between them and their oppressors. That the man of the earth may no more oppress; or, that terrene man may no longer terrify. There is a play upon the two words in the original, which might thus be rendered. But it has been said, with truth, that this sort of rhetorical ornament \"does not suit the genius of our language\" (Erle).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.110":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord said unto my Lord. Jehovah said unto him who is my Lord and Master, i.e. to Messiah, who is my liege Lord, although about to be, in some mysterious way, my descendant. Sit thou at my right hand. An exaltation too high for any merely human personage (comp. Acts 2:33; Acts 7:56; Hebrews 1:3). Until I make thine enemies thy footstool. To place the foot upon the neck or body of defeated enemies was a common practice of Oriental conquerors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion. \"The rod of thy strength,\" or \"thy strong scepter,\" is the same thing as \"thy ruling power\" (see Jeremiah 48:17; Ezekiel 19:11). The ruling power of Messiah was to go forth from Jerusalem (Acts 1:4-8; Acts 2:1-4). Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Ac cording to Professor Cheyne, these are the words of Jehovah - a continuation of the address in ver. 1; but they are more gene rally regarded as the words of the writer of the psalm, i.e., according to our exegesis, of David. He calls on the Messiah to take his power and reign.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power. In the full sense of the word, Messiah can only rule over \"willing\" hearts. In the day of his power, his people will offer themselves gladly to be his soldiers and servants, and flock to his banner, as the Israelites to that of Deborah and Barak, when \"the people willingly offered themselves\" (Judges 5:2, 9; comp. Isaiah 49:18-23; Isaiah 60:1-5; Isaiah 66:19-23). In the beauties of holiness. At once warriors and saints, meet for the service of one who was at once Priest (ver. 4) and King. From the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth. This is the division of the clauses now generally adopted; but the intention of this last clause is very doubtful. Some understand it of Messiah himself, and explain, \"As the dew of the morning, abundant, refreshing, spreading far and wide, miraculous, so is the might of thy perpetual youth\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 428); others, and the larger number, interpret it of Messiah's army, \"As dew out el the early morning dawn, descending by a silent, mysterious birth from the star-lit heaven, so comes to Messiah his mighty host of followers\" (comp. Isaiah 26:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent. \"A fresh revelation\" (Cheyne). David, admitted into the councils of the Most High, has been made aware that the Messiah is, by God's decree, to be both King and Priest. God has \"sworn\" this, and will certainly not draw back from his oath. Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Not, like ordinary priests, a priest for a few years, or for a lifetime, but a priest forever and ever (לעולם) - seeing \"he ever liveth to make intercession for us\" (Hebrews 7:25). And a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek.\" Not, that is, after the order of Aaron, who was a priest and nothing more, but after that of Melchizedek, the elder priesthood, which combined the offices of priest and king (see Hebrews 5:6-10; Hebrews 7:1-10, 20-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. \"Adonai\" here is certainly Jehovah (Cheyne). He stands at Messiah's right hand (comp. Psalm 16:8; Psalm 121:5) to protect and defend him, and give him victory in the battle. Ver. 5 carries on the description of Messiah's triumph begun in ver. 3. The kings to be \"struck through\" are those that resist the progress of the gospel - Herod Agrippa, Galerius, Julian, and the like.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He shall judge among the heathen; i.e. execute the royal office not only over Israel, but over the nations of the earth generally (comp. Psalm 7:9; Psalm 9:9; Psalm 96:10, etc.). He shall fill the places with the dead bodies; rather, he shall fill the earth with dead bodies; i.e. with the corpses of those whom he has slain while executing judgment. He shall wound the heads over many countries. Thus translated, the clause merely repeats ver. 5. Perhaps a better rendering is that of Dr. Kay, \"He shall smite him that is head over the wide earth\" - either Satan or \"the central power of the whole confederacy of evil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm110:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He shall drink of the brook in the way. Primarily, the action described is that of pausing in the pursuit of enemies to refresh one's self with a draught of water from a brook by the wayside; but, if we interpret the passage of the Messiah, we must understand the refreshing draughts which he ever draws from the well-spring of truth and righteousness as he advances on his career of victory. Therefore (i.e. because of these draughts) he shall lift up the head. He shall never faint nor be weary (Isaiah 40:28), but shall continue the pursuit of his enemies unremittingly, as Bishop Perowne says, \"with renewed ardor, with head erect and kindling eye,\" never resting until at length all things shall have been put in subjection under his feet (Hebrews 2:8).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.111":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm111:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise ye the LORD.

Scarcely a part of the psalm - rather a heading or introduction. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart (comp. Psalm 9:1; Psalm 119:34, 58, 69). \"With my whole heart\" replaces the \"greatly\" of Psalm 109:30. In the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. Professor Cheyne translates, \"in the council and assembly of the upright;\" and it seems to be generally allowed that two distinct assemblies are not spoken of, but that the one congregation of the faithful is designated by two names. Thus the Prayer-book translation is wrong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm111:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The works of the Lord are great. Not his material works, but the doings of his providence (see vers. 3-9). Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. Searched into and carefully studied by all who take an interest in such things. Deru-shim, \"objects of study,\" is etymologically connected with madrasa, a college, a \"place of study and research.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm111:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - His work is honorable and glorious; literally, honor and glory; but our translators have rightly paraphrased.

Memorial institutions, like the Passover, are scarcely glanced at. The Lord is gracious and full of compassion; or, \"compassionate\" (comp. Psalm 103:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm111:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He hath given meat unto them that fear him. The manna may be primarily in the writer's mind, but he is also thinking of the \"food given to all flesh\" (Psalm 136:25) continually. He will ever be mindful of his covenant. The covenant with Abraham, made \"to a thousand generations\" (Psalm 105:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm111:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He hath showed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen; rather, in giving them. God manifested his power to Israel very specially by causing them to overcome the many strong Canaanitish nations, and to take their lands and labors in possession (Psalm 105:44).

In the sense in which they were given - the spiritual sense underlying them - not one jot or tittle of God's commandments ever passes away (Matthew 5:18).

The \"redemption\" from Egypt (Exodus 6:6) is perhaps especially in the writer's mind, but he may be thinking also of other deliverances. He hath commanded his covenant forever (comp. Genesis 9:12; Genesis 17:13; Exodus 31:16, etc.). Holy and reverend is his Name. Intrinsically \"holy,\" and therefore \"reverend,\" or to be reverenced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm111:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (comp. Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 9:10; Ecclus. 1:16; and also Job 28:28). The meaning seems to be that \"the beginning of wisdom is not found in keen insight, nor wide experience, nor the learn-hag of the schools, but in the temper of reverence and awe. The fear of the finite in the presence of the Infinite, of the sinful in the presence of the Holy, self-abhorring, adoring, as in Job's confession - this for the Israelite was the starting-point of all true wisdom\" (Dean Plumptre). A good under standing have all they that do his commandments; literally, that do them; but the \"commandments\" of ver. 7 are, no doubt, intended. His praise endureth forever. The praise \"of him,\" not \"of it,\" as in the Prayer-book Version.

The closing thought of Psalm 111. is taken up and expanded in Psalm 112. That delighteth greatly in his commandments (comp.

Bishop Butler has well shown how, in God's moral government of the world, virtue tends to accumulate to itself the good things of this life, and vice to disperse and dissipate them ('Analogy,' pt. 1. Psalm 3; comp. 1 Timothy 4:8). And his righteousness endureth forever. Human goodness - here called \"righteousness\" is a thing which does not change, since character is formed by habits, and habits are \"a second nature.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm112:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness. God's Word is \"a lantern unto their feet, and a light unto their paths\" (Psalm 119:105) - sufficient under most circumstances to guide their steps aright. When this is not enough, he vouchsafes an inward light to them (Psalm 27:1; Psalm 36:9; Isaiah 58:10; Isaiah 49:6, etc.). He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. It is a very forced interpretation to understand this as said of Jehovah. The entire subject of the psalm is the righteous, God-like man. In him are reflected shadows of all the Divine qualities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm112:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A good man showeth favor, and lendeth; rather, well is it with the man that showeth, etc. The verse is exegetical of the latter clause of ver. 4, and shows how the righteous man's compassion works. It makes him \"show favor,\" or \"kindness,\" to men generally, and \"lend\" to those who are in necessity (comp. Psalm 37:26; and for the duty of lending to the needy, see Deuteronomy 15:8, 11). He will guide his affairs with discretion; rather, perhaps, with equity.

Almost a repetition of the phrase in ver. 7, \"his heart is fixed\" - seemingly, therefore, superfluous, but really emphasizing the point, which is of great moment (see the comment of Hengstenberg, and compare the \"just man\" of Horace, 'Od.,' 3:3, 2. 1-8). He shall not be afraid. \"Perfect love casteth out fear\" (1 John 4:18). He who feels himself always and altogether in the hands of a loving Father cannot be afraid of what is about to befall him. Until he see his desire upon his enemies. He knows that his enemies have no real power to harm him, and that ultimately he will \"see his desire upon them;\" i.e. will triumph over them (see Psalm 54:7; Psalm 59:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm112:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor. There is no virtue in mere \"dispersing,\" since spendthrifts\" disperse\" even more lavishly than virtuous men. The only laudable \"dispersing\" is that which has for its object the relief of distress, and which (it may be added) is wisely directed to that object. His righteousness endureth forever (see the comment on ver. 3). His horn shall be exalted with honor. The esteem of men, on the whole, follows upon goodness, and the righteous obtain more honor than others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm112:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The wicked shall see it, and be grieved. The wicked hate the righteous (Psalm 105:25), and are naturally \"grieved\" to see them prosper. \"When shall he die, and his name perish?\" is the thought of their heart against the godly man. He shall gnash with his teeth (comp. Job 16:9; Psalm 35:16; Psalm 37:12; Lamentations 2:16: Acts 7:54). Civilization represses these emotional displays, but the feeling remains nevertheless. And melt away; or, \"consume away\" - \"waste away\" - through envy and hate. The desire of the wicked shall perish (comp. Psalm 1:6). \"The desire of the wicked\" - that which they earnestly long for, which is the downfall and destruction of the righteous - does not come to pass, but falls to the ground, \"perishes,\" comes to naught.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.113":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise ye the LORD.

By \"ye servants of the Lord,\" all faithful Israelites are certainly intended; but the phrase need not be absolutely limited to them (comp. ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Blessed be the Name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. The prayer here is that God may be praised through all time, as in the next verse it is that he may be praised through all space. In connection with the praise of God, limits of time and place are unsuitable (comp. Psalm 115:18; Psalm 121:8; 125:8; 131:3; Isaiah 59:21; Micah 4:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name is to be praised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same (comp.

As being \"the great King over all the earth\" (Psalm 47:2). And his glory above the heavens. \"The heaven, and heaven of heavens, cannot contain him\" (2 Chronicles 6:18). It is a \"humbling of himself\" to \"behold the things that are in heaven and earth\" (see ver. 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Who is like unto the Lord our God?

Who dwelleth on high; or, \"who sitteth enthroned on high.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth. It is a condescension in God to regard even \"the things that are in heaven,\" since the very \"heavens are not clean in his sight\" (Job 15:15). Much more is it a condescension in him to behold the gross material things of earth. Yet he gives them his constant care and attention, since otherwise they would cease to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He raiseth up the poor out of the dust. Heaven is full of his glory, earth of his mercy and loving-kindness. The words of 1 Samuel 2:8 are, consciously or unconsciously, quoted. And lifteth the needy out of the dunghill; rather, from the dunghill (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - That he may set him with princes. The words of 1 Samuel 2:8 are still followed. (For the sentiment, see also Job 36:7.) Historically, the statement is illustrated by the examples of Joseph, Saul, David, Daniel, Mordecai. Even with the princes of his people. Not merely with heathen princes, but with those who exercise sovereignty over Israel, as Joseph with Pharaoh, Daniel with Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus, Mordecai with Ahasuerus or Xerxes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm113:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He maketh the barren woman to keep house. Hannah's song is still in the psalmist's thoughts, and suggests this illustration (see 1 Samuel 2:5). But it must not be restricted to a literal interpretation. The true \"barren woman\" was Israel (Isaiah 54:1), whose curse of barrenness was ultimately removed, and who became, as here prophesied, a joyful mother of children (comp. Isaiah 49:12, 18, 20; Isaiah 54:2, 3; Isaiah 60:5; Galatians 4:27). Praise ye the Lord (comp.

The \"going forth from Egypt\" was the only thing parallel in Israelitish history to the going forth from Babylon. The nation should learn what to expect in the future by what occurred in the past. The house of Jacob (compare the more common \"house of Israel,\" Psalm 98:3; Psalm 115:12; Psalm 135:19) from a people of strange language; literally, from a stammering people; but a people of foreign speech is no doubt meant (compare the Septuagint, ἐκ λαοῦ βαρβάρου).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Judah was his sanctuary; or \"became his sanctuary;\" Judah - i.e. the land of Judah - received the special honor of being chosen for the seat of God's sanctuary. And Israel his dominion. While all the rest of Israel was accepted as constituting his kingdom or dominion. The whole people came under God's special protection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The sea saw it, and fled. \"The sea\" is the Red Sea. It \"looked,\" and saw God leading his people (Exodus 14:19-24), and then at once \"fled,\" and left a dry channel as \"a way for the ransomed to pass over.\" Jordan (literally, the Jordan) was driven back (comp. Joshua 3:13-17). These two marvels \"marked respectively the beginning and the end of Israel's long journey\" (Cheyne). They were parallel facts, and are naturally alluded to together (comp. Habakkuk 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs. The poet sees in the earthquake that shook Sinai (Exodus 19:18) a general commotion of the entire region, in which both the greater and the lesser elevations take part (comp. Psalm 29:6; Psalm 68:8, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou filledest thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back t. ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs? Most poetically, the psalmist apostrophizes the sea, the Jordan, the mountains, and the lesser hills, inquiring of them for what reason they had forsaken their nature and done such strange things; or rather, addressing them as present, and as if the scenes were being enacted before his eyes, and asking why they are so strangely employed - what is causing the commotion and disturbance (see the Revised Version, where the present tense is used throughout the two verses).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord. The answer is given, but only indirectly given, in these words. Nothing less than \"the presence of the Lord\" - a miraculous and abnormal presence - can have produced the strange phenomena. The earth has felt the presence of God, and has trembled, and has done right to tremble; but Israel may take comfort from the theophany, for it is a manifestation on her behalf. The presence that has made itself felt is the presence of the God of Jacob - the God who watches over Jacob, and will succor and protect him constantly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm114:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Which turned the rook into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters (see Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:11).

Is he unable, or is he unwilling, to deliver them?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm115:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But - rather, and - as though he would say, \"and all the while, as the heathen scorn and question\" - our God is in the heavens; in his place, where he always is, watching over us.

They scoff at the God of Israel. What, then, are their own gods? Silver and gold indeed (ver. 4), but the work of human hands. Fashioned into a human shape, as if they were sentient being - but absolutely devoid of all sense and intelligence. The satire is somewhat roughly worked out (vers. 5-7), but idolatry provokes rough speaking; and the tone here adopted is imitated in Psalm 135:15-18, and echoed in Isaiah 44:9-20. The inspired writers seem to have felt, that, when idolatry came under consideration, the criticism should be brief and trenchant. Verse 4. - Their idols are silver and gold. At the best - often mere wood and stone (Deuteronomy 4:28); but the idols of the Babylonians were mostly of the more precious materials (Herod., 1:183; Daniel 3:1; Ep. Jeremiah 1:4, 11, etc.). The work of men's hands (Psalm 135:15; Isaiah 44:12-17).

Equally vain, futile, and power less (comp. Isaiah 44:9; Jeremiah 2:5). So is every one that trusteth in them. To \"trust\" in an idol is an almost inconceivable folly.

Three several times the leader of the choir gives forth the call - \" Trust in the Lord \" - and three several times the choir responds with the acknowledgment that he, and he alone, \"is their Help and Shield.\" The exhortation seems to be addressed, first, to the lay people generally (ver. 9); then to the clerical order (ver. 10); finally, to all, whether laity or clergy, who are true Israelites at heart (comp. vers. 12, 13). Verse 9. - O Israel, trust thou in the Lord. Follow not the example of the heathen who trust in idols. Rather, be an example to them. He is their Help and their Shield (comp. Psalm 33:20).

This was the original blessing bestowed on Abraham (Genesis 13:16; Genesis 17:4-6), and continually reiterated (Genesis 18:18; Genesis 22:17; Genesis 28:14, etc.). It is much dwelt upon by Isaiah (Isaiah 49:8-12, 18-23; Isaiah 54:1-3; Isaiah 60:3-12, etc.). The main fulfillment of the promise was through the conversion of the Gentiles, who, when converted, became the true \"Israel of God.\" But, even apart from this, the lineal descendants of Abraham have \"increased more and more,\" to an extent which is most extraordinary. You and your children. You yourselves shall increase; but your children shall yet more increase.

They belong to him - he dwells there; but it is otherwise with the earth. But the earth hath he given to the children of men. For man God framed this fair world; to man's use he adapted it with minutest care; and certainly not least for his own people, who are \"the salt of the earth\" - the human race by representation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm115:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - Once more the choir and congregation speak. The mention of \"heaven and earth\" (ver. 15) reminds them of the third place - Sheol. In Sheol is no praise of God, but only \"silence.\" They, at any rate, while they remain on earth, and have the power to praise God, will praise him without ceasing. Verse 17. - The dead praise not the Lord (comp. Psalm 6:5; Psalm 30:9; Psalm 88:11; Isaiah 38:18). Neither any that go down into silence.

Verse 1. - I love the Lord, because he hath heard; literally, I love, because the Lord (Jehovah) hath heard. The object of this love is not expressed, but can only be Jehovah. Still, the grammatical construction is unusual, and has caused the suggestion of an emendation. For אהבתי Professor Cheyne would read האמנתי as at the beginning of ver. 10.

Therefore will I call upon him as long as I live; literally, in my days - another expression attributed to Hezekiah in the history (Isaiah 39:8).

Verse 3. - The sorrows of death compassed me; literally, the cords of death (comp. Psalm 18:4, where the same expression is used). Death is pictured as seizing his victim and binding him with cords. And the pains of hell gat hold upon me; or, \"the straits of hell\" (comp. Psalm 118:5; Lamentations 1:3). Death and hell (shell) are closely connected together in the prayer of Hezekiah (Isaiah 38:10, 18). I found trouble and sorrow; or, \"anguish and woe\" (comp.

God's answers to prayer show him to be both \"gracious\" and \"righteous\" - gracious, because it is of his mercy that he listens to men; righteous, because, having promised to hear prayer, he is bound to keep his promises. Yea, our God is merciful; or, \"compassionate.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord preserveth the simple; i.e. \"the simple-minded\" - those who are without guile or artifice (comp. Psalm 19:7). I was brought low. The same verb is used here as in Isaiah 38:14, where it is translated \"fail\" (\"mine eyes fail\"). It expresses extreme weakness, or exhaustion. And he helped me; or, \"saved me\" (comp.

If Hezekiah is the writer, the \"bountiful dealing\" will be the addition of fifteen years to his life (Isaiah 38:5). If a poet just re turned from the Captivity, the return and the reoccupation of the Holy Land will be especially in his thoughts (comp.

This verse is exegetical of the last clause of ver. 4. The expressions are taken from Psalm 56:13, and suit a personal better than a national deliverance. Mine eyes from tears. Hezekiah, when told that his death was approaching, had \"wept sore\" (Isaiah 38:3). And my feet from falling; literally, and my foot from slipping When man is greatly tried, there is always danger lest his foot should slip. Whether the trial befall an individual or a nation, there is the same temptation to rebel and murmur.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living; rather, lands of the living; i.e. my deliverance will enable me to walk at leisure, unhurried and free from care, in the broad regions of earth inhabited by the living.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Parenthetic and obscure. Both the connection and rendering are doubtful. Professor Cheyne translates, \"I was confident that I should speak thus;\" i.e. even while my affliction was going on, I felt confident that relief would come, and that I should one day speak as I have just spoken. I was, however, too sorely afflicted to give utterance to my feeling. Instead of so doing, I vented my unhappiness in abuse of my fellow-men. Thus understood, the words are an apologia. Verse 10. - I believed, therefore have I spoken. So the LXX., Ἐπίστευσα διὸ ἐλάλησα. But many other meanings are suggested. See the preceding paragraph.

What return can the psalmist make? First, he will accept the blessing joyfully; next, he will ever continue to call upon God (ver. 13; comp. vers. 4, 17); thirdly, he will pay his vows openly in the temple, in the presence of the whole congregation (vers. 14, 18); fourthly, he will offer continually the sacrifice of thanksgiving (ver. 17) for the benefits vouchsafed him. The enumeration of his pious intentions is itself a song of praise to the Almighty. Verse 12. - What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? Natural piety suggests a return for favors received. What shall this be? the psalmist asks, and then proceeds to give the answer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I will take the cup of salvation. It has been usual to explain this of actual participation in the contents of a cup offered at a sacrificial meal, and then passed round to the worshippers. But there is no clear evidence of any such usage, except in connection with the Passover, which cannot here be in question. Hengstenberg there fore proposes to regard the phrase as a mere metaphor, like the \"cup of trembling\" (Isaiah 51:17, 22), and understands the psalmist to mean that he will gladly and thankfully receive God's mercy vouchsafed to him, and thus show his gratitude for it. And call upon the Name of the Lord (comp. vers. 4 and 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people (comp. vers. 18, 19, where the thought is repeated, and lengthened out). We are not told in Isaiah or 2 Kings that Hezekiah made any vows when he lay on his sick bed, but he may probably have done so.

Rather, it is a matter of deep concern to him. \"In him are the issues of life and death\" (Psalm 68:20), and he appoints to each man the day and attendant circumstances of his demise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - O Lord, truly I am thy servant; rather, even so, O Lord, for I am thy servant. Entitled, therefore, to thy care and consideration. I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid (comp. Psalm 86:16). \"Thine handmaid\" - the Church; or, if the writer is Hezekiah, \"thy handmaid, Abiyah, the daughter of Zechariah,\" who \"had under standing in the vision of God\" (2 Chronicles 26:5; 2 Chronicles 29:1). Thou hast loosed my bonds. The \"cords of death\" (ver. 3) are probably intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Scarcely an actual sacrifice. Rather, simple thanksgiving, which, from a sincere heart, is the best sacrifice (see Psalm 50:14 and Hosea 14:2). And will call upon the Name of the Lord (comp. vers. 4 and 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm116:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.

Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - In the courts of the Lord's house. Thanksgiving was always most appropriately offered in the temple courts, where close at hand dwelt the mysterious presence of God, and where God had appointed that his worshippers should appear before him. In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. This expression and the preceding suit well with Hezekiah's authorship of the psalm, as Dr. Kay well argues. Praise ye the Lord. The writer calls on all those present (see ver. 18) to join him in singing praise to God (comp. Psalm 104, 105, 106, 113, 115, 117.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.117":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm117:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O praise the Lord, all ye nations; or, \"all ye Gentiles,\" as in Romans 15:11. The goim are especially the heathen nations of the earth (comp. Psalm 2:1, 8; Psalm 9:5, 15, 19, 20, etc.). Praise him; rather, laud him (Revised Version). The verbs in the two clauses are different.

Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For his merciful kindness (or, his mercy) is great towards us; literally, has been great over us. The appeal is to history, and the mercy intended is that shown in God's continual protection of Israel. And the truth of the Lord endureth forever. God's \"truth\" is here, as so often, his faithfulness to his promises, the promises being especially those made to Abraham and David. His mercy and truth\" to Israel were an indication of what the Gentiles might expect of him in his dealings with them (comp.

It is generally agreed that the Babylonian captivity is intended. The nation had called to God in its distress by the mouth of Daniel (Daniel 9:4-19) and of other holy men. The Lord answered me, and set me in a large place; literally, the Lord answered me on the open plain. The idea is, \"The Lord gave me enlargement\" - took me out of my straits - \"set my feet in a large room\" (Psalm 31:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord is on my side. \"At this point the speaker transfers his point of view into the past; he is once more fear less in the midst of foes\" (Cheyne). I will not fear (comp. Psalm 23:4; Psalm 27:1; Psalm 56:4, etc.). What can man do unto me? Man is powerless against God. \"If God be for us [i.e. on our side], who can be against us?\" (Romans 8:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The Lord taketh my part with them that help me; literally, the Lord is on my side among my helpers (comp.

Psalm 54:7; Psalm 59:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man (comp. Psalm 62:8, 9). Israel, on its return from the Captivity, had begun by putting a good deal of trust in its human helpers, as Cyrus and the other friendly heathen mentioned in Ezra 1:4-6; Ezra 3:7. But this help, after a little time, had failed them (Ezra 4:1-24), and they had found themselves in great difficulties.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. The \"princes\" after Cyrus had proved \"broken reeds,\" and, instead of favoring Israel, had favored Israel's enemies (Ezra 4:6-24). At last Darius had done them justice, but it was felt that no sure dependence could be placed either on him or on his successors. Jehovah alone was Israel's safe ground of confidence, He \"would not fail them, nor forsake them\" (Joshua 1:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All nations compassed me about. This is, of course, hyperbole. But it was a fact that all, or almost all, the nations among whom the Israelites dwelt were at all times hostile to them, and sought their destruction. But in the Name of the Lord will I destroy them; or, \"I will mow them down\" (comp. Job 24:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about (comp. Psalm 88:17). The special compassing about alluded to is probably that in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, when not only the Babylonians but the Syrians, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Edomites took part in hostilities against Israel (2 Kings 24:2; Psalm 137:7). But in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them. The threefold repetition of this trenchant phrase (vers. 10, 11, 12) lends it vast additional force. It is no casual utterance, no mere wish, or thought begotten of a wish, but a deep and firm conviction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They compassed me about like bees; i.e. in vast numbers, and with intense energy, and a furious desire to injure (comp. Deuteronomy 1:44; and the powerful description of Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:236-238). They are quenched as the fire of thorns. Their fury dies away and goes out suddenly, like a fire kindled among thorns, which blazes up with vast heat and noise, but in a short time dies down and disappears. For in the Name of the Lord I will destroy them (see the comment on ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou hast thrust lore at me that I might fall; rather, thou didst thrust (Revised Version). The psalmist recalls the past, and throws himself, as it were, once more into the midst of the struggle. Thou - mine enemy, Babylon - didst make s desperate onset upon me, fully intending my destruction. But the Lord helped me. Frustrated thy purpose - preserved the life, the national life, which thou aimedst at destroying, and so did most effectually \"help me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Lord is my strength and my song, and is become my salvation. The deliverance was such that no words but those of the Song of Moses (Exodus 15:2) could fitly celebrate it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous (comp. Ezra 6:16, 22). \"Tabernacles,\" or \"tents,\" is continually used by the sacred writers as a synonym for \"dwellings.\" The use of the expression here by no means implies that the Israelites of the time were actually living in tents. The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly (scrap. Exodus 15:6, 12). God's right hand was at the time stretched out to protect and preserve Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The right hand of the Lord is exalted (compare the parallel expression in Exodus 15:6, \"Thy right hand, O God, is become glorious in power\"). When God's right hand effects a deliverance, it gets, as it were, additional glory to itself. The right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. So, already, in ver. 16. Repetition is a special characteristic of this psalm (see vers. 1, 2, 3, 4; vers. 8, 9; vers. 10-12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I shall not die, but live. The psalmist speaks, not in his own person, but in the name of his nation. They had been brought very near to extinction; but now the danger was past. God had given them \"a reviving\" (Ezra 9:8, 9); and they felt that henceforth they would \"live.\" And declare the works of the Lord. They would employ the new life granted them in \"declaring God's works\" (see Psalm 40:5, 10; Psalm 96:3; Psalm 145:4-6); i.e. they would witness to all men of \"the might of his marvelous acts,\" and \"abundantly utter the memory of his great goodness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The Lord hath chastened me sore.

But he hath not given me over unto death (see the comment on ver. 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOpen to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Open to me the gates of righteousness. The great gate of the temple being now reached, admission to the interior is requested. The gates are called \"the gates of righteousness,\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) as gates which none but the righteous ought to enter (see the next verse); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) as gates through which access is gained to the sanctuary of him who alone is truly righteous, and the source of all righteousness in others. I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord. Praise could be given to God any where; but it was most appropriately offered \"in the courts of the Lord's house, even in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem\" (Psalm 116:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter; rather, this is the gate of the Lord: the righteous [and they alone] shall enter by it. \"This verse seems to stand apart - a solo, chanted by a voice out of the temple gate\" (Kay). Though sinners doubtless sometimes entered (2 Kings 11:13; 2 Chronicles 26:16-20; John 2:14), none but the righteous had any right to enter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - I will praise thee; for thou hast heard me. The chant of the procession as it enters - a prolongation of the strain begun in ver. 19. And art become my salvation (comp. ver. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. The primary and literal meaning seems to be - \" Israel, which the great of the world, those who think to arrange the world ac cording to their own ideas, have rejected and would fain have cast aside, has, nevertheless, despite their rejection, attained to eminence, and been advanced, by the course of events, into such a position, that it may be regarded as the head corner-stone - the most important of all the nations of the world.\" Any Messianic reference is secondary and subordinate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. This fresh elevation of Israel to importance - especially to such great importance - can only be attributed to the work of Divine providence. It is \"the Lord's doing\" - literally, \"from the Lord\" - and is one of the most marvelous events of history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - This is the day which the Lord hath made. The thanksgiving day is one which has been fore-ordained of God, and brought into existence by him for a special purpose. We will therefore carry out God's purpose, and rejoice and be glad in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord; or, \"we beseech thee.\" The interjectional אנא is as suitable to the several speakers as to one. O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity; i.e. continue to save, continue to send prosperity. Israel feels its constant dependence upon God, and that if the Divine care were remitted for a day, or for an hour, all would be lost. Tears, as Professor Cheyne observes, continually mingle with Israel's laughter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Blessed be he that cometh in the Name of the Lord. Once more a voice issues from the interior of the temple (comp. ver. 20). The priestly choir there stationed to receive the procession, blesses it as coming \"in the Name of the Lord;\" i.e. for a religious purpose, and with pious intentions. We have blessed you, they say (or, rather perhaps, we bless you) out of the house of the Lord. \"The house of the Lord is the fountain and the treasury of all blessing\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - God is the Lord, which hath showed us light. Having received the priestly benediction, the processionists resume their strain. They have entered within the courts; they are approaching the altar of sacrifice; they have brought their offering. \"Jehovah,\" they say, \"is God, and hath given us light\" (see the Revised Version). That is, he has enlightened our spirits to see and acknowledge his mercies; or, perhaps, he has led us, as he did the people, by a pillar of fire in the wilderness; and now we stand before the altar with our offering - receive it at our hands, ye priests-and bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. So shalt the act of thanksgiving be complete, and the solemn service ended. The fanciful exposition of Luther, lately revived by Professor Cheyne, will scarcely approve itself to critics generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee. This is the acknowledgment made by each and all, and probably repeated many times, while the sacrifice is being consumed upon the altar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm118:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever. The psalm ends, as it began, with the usual thanksgiving refrain (comp. 1 Chronicles 16:34; 2 Chronicles 5:13; Ezra 3:11; Psalm 106:1; Psalm 107:1; Psalm 118:1-4; Psalm 136:1-26).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.119":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTALEPH.

The \"way\" intended is, no doubt, \"the way of righteousness\" (Psalm 1:7; 23:3, etc.). Who walk in the Law of the Lord. Compare the introductory paragraph for the meaning of \"Law\" in this psalm. This clause is exegetical of the preceding.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Blessed are they that keep his testimonies. A variant expression for keeping the Law, rather than the specification of a particular part of it. And that seek him with the whole heart. This is the emphatic portion of the verse. An obedience \"from the heart\" is alone acceptable to God (see Psalm 36:10; Psalm 64:10; Psalm 119:34, 58, 69, 145).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

Men sometimes give precepts which they do not care to have obeyed; but God's precepts are intended for careful, diligent, and continual observance. The \"thou\" at the beginning (attah) is emphatic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! The first four verses of the stanza are concerned with the Law in itself; the last four treat of the writer's relation to it.

Shame follows transgression: I shall escape shame, if my obedience is perfect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.

Then obedience and acceptable praise will follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I will keep thy statutes.

It does not follow from this inquiry that the writer is a \"young man\" - rather the reverse. He is anxious to give advice to young men, which is naturally the part of one somewhat advanced in life. By taking heed thereto, according to thy Word. This is the answer to the question raised in clause 1.

God's statutes are really known to those only whom God teaches. By nature we have but a faint glimmer of their meaning. God must teach us by his Spirit ere we can apprehend them aright.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. \"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" The \"word\" hid in the psalmist's heart (ver. 11) could not but rise to his lips on fit occasion, and be set forth before the people for their edification - more especially as there was an express command binding upon all Israelites to teach the Law to their children and dependants (see particularly Deuteronomy 6:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches (comp. ver. 72).

This is given as a reason for the prayer of ver. 19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thou hast rebuked the proud. It is difficult to connect this with the preceding. But perhaps the link may be found in the double sense of mishpatim, \"judgments,\" which includes verbal sentences against sinners delivered in the Law, and also actual sentences upon them in deed and fact. These last are in the writer's mind in the present verse - such judgments as those upon Pharaoh (Exodus 14:23-31), Zerah (2 Chronicles 14:9-15), and Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:32-37). That are cursed. This clause is questioned, as metrically redundant. But Hebrew metrology is scarcely as yet an exact science. And the clause finds its justification in Deuteronomy 27:26. Which do err from thy commandments. Such error brings under a curse those who commit it. If it be a blessed thing to walk in God's Law (ver. 1), it must be a cursed thing to transgress against it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Remove from me reproach and contempt. God's servants almost necessarily incur the reproach and contempt of the worldly, to whom their conduct seems folly or madness. Christ himself was \"despised;\" (Isaiah 53:3) and reproached (Matthew 11:19). For I have kept thy testimonies (comp. vers. 31, 51, 87, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPrinces also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Princes also did sit and speak against me. The great of the earth too often take part against the righteous, and join in persecuting them and calumniating them (comp. ver. 161). But thy servant did meditate in thy statutes; i.e. I took no heed of their calumnies - they did not trouble me. I gave myself to meditation on thy commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thy testimonies also are my delight (comp. vers. 16, 47, 70, 77, etc.,) and my counselors: i.e. my best advisers. I learn from them - better than in any other way - how I ought to act (comp. ver. 105).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - My soul cleaveth unto the dust. My soul is greatly depressed - lies, as it were, in the dust of death (comp. Psalm 44:25). Quicken thou me according to thy Word. Raise me up to life and health and vigor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I have declared thy ways, and thou heardest me; i.e. \"I have opened my griefs to thee, O God, and poured forth my heart before thee. I am confident that thou didst listen to me.\" Teach me thy statutes. That I may show my gratitude by keeping them (comp. ver. 33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Make me to understand the way of thy precepts. Exegetical of the last clause of ver. 26. What the psalmist longs for is to have a perfect knowledge of God's Law in all its breadth (ver. 96) and depth (Psalm 92:5) and fullness. So shall I talk of thy wondrous works; rather, so will I muse upon thy marvels (so Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version). The \"marvels\" spoken of are \"the wondrous things of God's Law\" (ver. 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - My soul melteth for heaviness (comp. Psalm evil. 26; and, for the sentiment, see ver. 25). Strengthen thou me according unto thy Word; i.e. according to thy promise to help thy faithful ones (comp. vers. 25, 41, 49, 58, 76, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Remove from me the way of lying; i.e. the way of apostasy, or irreligion, of departure from God. And grant me thy Law graciously. Make it known to me by a Divine illumination.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - I have chosen the way of truth. The converse of \"the way of lying\" (ver. 29), the path of true religion, of faithfulness and steadfastness to God. Thy judgments have I laid before me. Thy commandments have I set before my eyes as rules to be observed constantly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - I have stuck unto thy testimonies; or, \"cleaved\" (ver. 25); i.e. kept firm and steadfast to them. The writer does not mean to assert sinlessness, but only sincerity of intention, and a general endeavor to do right. O Lord, put me not to shame. Suffer me not to fall from thee in such sort that I am put to an open shame.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. The phrase used in the second clause is ambiguous. It may mean, \"For thou hast enlarged my heart.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHE. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes. This is the main prayer of the psalm - a prayer for spiritual enlightenment. It occurs eight times (vers. 12, 26, 33, 64, 68, 108, 124, and 135). And I shall keep it unto the end. Either \"to the end of my life,\" or (as Dr. Kay thinks) \"to the uttermost.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy Law; i.e. make me fully to understand thy Law, and then I shall assuredly keep it. If I fail now, it is from lack of wisdom, not of will. Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart (comp. ver. 69).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Make me to go in the path of thy commandments. Keep me, i.e., from straying out of the right path, through ignorance or negligence. For therein do I delight (comp. vers. 16, 24, 47, 70, 77, 111, 174).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIncline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Incline my heart unto thy testimonies. The writer recognizes that the right inclination of the heart, which he claims to have (vers. 7, 10, 32, 34, etc.), is itself the gift of God. And not to covetousness; or, \"to gain\" (comp. ver. 72).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity. Let me not be distracted from thy service by the \"vanities\" of the world - wealth, honor, power, glory, and the like; rather, quicken thou me in thy way. Give me increased life, strength, and vigor, to walk continually in the way of thy commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Stablish thy Word unto thy servant; or, \"make good thy promise unto thy servant\" - thy promise of aid and support in all times of temptation and difficulty. Who is devoted to thy fear; rather, which belongeth unto thy fear. The antecedent to the relative is \"word\" or \"promise,\" and not \"servant;\" and the prayer is that God will make good to his servant that promise, which lies at the root of all reverence and godly fear (comp. Psalm 130:4, \"There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Turn away my reproach, which I fear; i.e. \"turn away from me the only reproach of which I am afraid - the reproach of transgressing against thy Law\" (comp. ver. 31). For thy judgments are good. Right in themselves, and conducive to man's happiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Behold, I have longed after thy precepts (comp. vers. 20 and 131). There are those - few, it may be, but truly blessed - who \"hunger and thirst after righteousness\" (Matthew 5:6). Quicken me in thy righteousness (comp. ver. 37). Help my efforts to walk in thy righteous ways.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVAU. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Let thy mercies come also unto me, O Lord; rather, and let thy mercies come unto me. Each verse of this stanza begins with the van conjunctive. Even thy salvation, according to thy Word; or, \"thy promise\" (imrah). God's Word was pledged, that he would grant mercy and salvation to all his faithful servants (Deuteronomy 28:1-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me (comp. ver. 22). If God's favor were manifestly shown him, his enemies would be sufficiently answered. For I trust in thy Word. This is what he looks for, since he has a full trust in God's promises to his servants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth. \"The word of truth\" here is the \"well-grounded answer\" that the psalmist looks to make to those who reproach him (Hengstenberg). (See the preceding verse.) If God does not grant him \"mercy and salvation\" (ver. 41), this answer will be \"taken out of his mouth.\" For I have hoped in thy judgments. I have trusted in thy vindication of my character, and in thy judgments upon my foes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - So shall I keep thy Law continually forever and ever. God's mercy will draw forth the psalmist's gratitude, and make his obedience perfect and perpetual.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - And I will walk at liberty. Rekhabah is literally \"the open square of a city,\" hence \"a wide, open, free space.\" In obeying God's commandments the psalmist will not feel himself under constraint, but a wholly free agent. For I seek thy precepts. Inclination, not constraint, makes him obey God's precepts - he \"seeks\" them, \"loves\" them (ver. 47), \"delights in\" them (vers. 16, 24, 47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings. If occasion offer, I will bear my witness to the excellence of thy Law, even before kings. And will not be ashamed; i.e. will not allow shame to stop my mouth. The writer is evidently not a king himself, probably not among the great ones of the earth (see vers. 51, 69, 78, 85, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - And I will delight myself in thy commandments (comp. vers. 14, 16, 24, 35, 77, etc.). Which I have loved (see below, vers. 48, 97, 113, 119, 127, 159, 163, 167).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved. In a sort of qualified worship (comp. Genesis 14:22; Psalm 28:2; Psalm 134:2; Psalm 141:2; Lamentations 3:41). And I will meditate in thy statutes. Almost a repetition of ver. 15a.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTZAIN. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Remember the word unto thy servant; i.e. \"the word spoken to thy servant.\" Some special Divine communication made to the writer is perhaps meant. Upon which (rather, because) thou hast caused me to hope (comp. vers. 74, 81, 147).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - This is my comfort in my affliction. Nekhamah, \"comfort,\" occurs only here and in Job 6:10; but the meaning is well ascertained. For thy Word hath quickened me; or, \"thy promise.\" The \"word,\" whatever it was, referred to in ver. 49. This had given the psalmist new life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - The proud have had me greatly in derision; rather, proud men. There is no article. (For the \"derision\" to which the righteous are always exposed, see Job 30:1, 9; Psalm 35:16; Psalm 44:13, 14; Lamentations 3:14; Jeremiah 20:7, etc.) Yet have I not declined (or, swerved) from thy Law (see the comment on ver. 31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord. Not merely thy sentences upon wicked men, but all the course of thy providential government of the world, including thy deliverances of thy servants. And have comforted myself. Have found comfort, i.e., in calling them to mind, and dwelling upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHorror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy Law. The Revised Version has \"hot indignation\" instead of \"horror;\" and so Rosenmüller, Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Professor Alexander, and others; but Dr. Kay well defends the Authorized Version ('The Psalms,' Appendix 1. pp. 462, 463). The feeling intended probably resembled that described by Ezra (Ezra 9:6). The ἀθυμίαof the LXX. does not ill express it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage; literally, songs have thy statutes been to me in the house of my sojournings. I have made thy statutes the theme of my songs, as they are of this present one. \"The house of my sojournings\" is either this present world, where all men are \"strangers and pilgrims\" (Hebrews 11:13), or perhaps some foreign land in which the writer had been a sojourner.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - I have remembered thy Name, O Lord, in the night (comp. Psalm 63:6; Psalm 149:5; and Job 35:10). And have kept thy Law. The night is the time when wicked men do their most wicked deeds (Job 24:14-16). I keep thy Law both night and day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis I had, because I kept thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - This I had, because I kept thy precepts; rather, this I have, that I keep thy precepts; i.e. this one thing I have, and it is my best and dearest possession, that I keep thy commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCHETH. Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - Thou art my Portion, O Lord (see Psalm 73:26; Psalm 142:5; and comp. Numbers 18:20; Joshua 13:33). I have said that I would keep thy words; or, \"I have resolved\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - I entreated thy favor with my whole heart; literally, I have supplicated thy face (comp. Psalm 45:12). Be merciful unto me, according to thy Word. A repetition of the prayer of ver. 41.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 59. - I thought on my ways; i.e. I examined my conduct in the past, considered it, and passed judgment upon it. And turned my feet unto thy testimonies. When I found my conduct amiss, I altered it, turning my feet into the way of thy commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 60. - I made haste. Men are apt to put off their repentance - to delay it to a more \"convenient season\" (Acts 24:25). The psalmist was not so foolish - he \"made haste,\" he says; and delayed not to keep God's commandments. This was wise, for \"now is the accepted time\" (2 Corinthians 6:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 61. - The bands of the wicked have robbed me; rather, the snares of wicked men entangled me (comp. vers. 23, 157, 161). But I have not forgotten (or, I did not forget) thy Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 62. - At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee (comp. ver. 55). Because of thy righteous judgments (see the comment on ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:63VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 63. - I am a companion of all them that fear thee; i.e. I do not consort with the ungodly or the careless, but only with those who love and reverence thee. It is well to live \"separate from sinners\" (comp. Psalm 1:1). And of them that keep thy precepts. Obedience necessarily follows on reverence and godly fear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:64VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 64. - The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy (comp. Psalm 33:5). God's mercy is \"over all his works\" (Psalm 145:9). The whole world is full of it. Pessimistic views are opposed to the entire tenor of Scripture. Teach me thy statutes (comp. vers. 12, 26, 33, 68, 108, 124, 135).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:65VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 65. - Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Lord. Notwithstanding all that he has suffered from the \"persecution\" of princes (ver. 161) and the \"contempt\" (ver. 22) and \"derision\" of the wicked generally (ver. 51), the psalmist feels that God's dealings with him have, on the whole, been good and gracious. According unto thy Word. As thou hast promised in thy Word to deal with thy servants (comp. vers. 41, 58, 170).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:66VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTeach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 66. - Teach me good judgment and knowledge; i.e. give me sound judgment and wisdom, to discern right from wrong. For I have believed thy commandments. I have looked to them, and trusted in them as my guides in the way of righteousness (comp. ver. 105).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:67VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 67. - Before I was afflicted I went astray. \"Sweet are the uses of adversity.\" The psalmist feels end confesses that the afflictions, which he has suffered (see comment on ver. 65), have been good for him. They have made him less apt to \"go astray\" than he was (comp. ver. 71). But now have I kept thy Word (comp. vers. 51, 56, 87, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:68VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 68. - Thou art good, and doest good. Even chastening is a proof of thy goodness. By it thou \"doest good\" to thy servants (see Hebrews 12:10, 11). Teach me thy statutes. Impress thy Law upon me, even though it be by chastening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:69VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 69. - The proud have forged a lie against me; literally, patched up a lie against me (comp. vers. 22, 23, 42, 78, etc.). But I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart (comp. vers. 2, 10, 34, etc.). \"The connection of the clauses is - that all the craft and malice of his enemies should only lead him to obey God with a more undivided heart than ever\" (Professor Alexander).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:70VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 70. - Their heart is as fat as grease; i.e. dull, gross, insensible to spiritual things (see Psalm 17:10; Isaiah 6:10). But I delight in thy Law. My heart is unlike theirs. Thy Law is a \"delight\" to it (comp. yore. 16, 24, 35, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:71VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 71. - It is good for me that I have been afflicted (see the comment on ver. 67). That I might learn thy statutes. The whole nation \"learnt God's statutes\" by the affliction of the Babylonish Captivity. Individuals \"learnt\" them equally by their special chastisements.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:72VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 72. - The Law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver; i.e. I value it more than any amount of earthly riches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:73VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 73. - Thy hands have made me and fashioned me (comp. Psalm 100:3; Psalm 138:8; Psalm 139:14). The \"fundamental passage\" is Deuteronomy 32:6; but the present psalmist seems to follow Job 10:8. Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. If thou hast done so much for me, wilt thou not do more? Without \"understanding\" this body that thou hast given me is nothing worth (comp. ver. 34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:74VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 74. - They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; literally, will see me and be glad. I shall be a fresh proof to them that God does not forsake his servants. Because I have hoped in thy Word. I have not fallen from grace - I have continued to trust in thy promises.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:75VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 75. - I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are right; literally, are righteousness - have in them nothing that is not just and good. And that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me. The Prayer-book Version brings out the full sense of the words, \"And that thou in very faithfulness hast caused me to be troubled\" (comp. vers. 67, 68, 71, with the comment furnished by Hebrews 12:5-11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:76VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 76. - Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort (comp. ver. 41 and Psalm 90:15). After affliction man feels the need of \"comfort,\" and longs for some manifestation of the Divine \"kindness.\" According to thy Word unto thy servant. According to the general tenor of thy promises.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:77VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 77. - Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live. The psalmist's afflictions have brought him near to the gates of death. God must visit him with his \"tender mercies\" for him once more to \"live.\" For thy Law is my delight. His renewed life will be an exercising of himself in God's Law, since that Law is his \"delight\" (comp. vers. 16, 24, 47, 111, 174).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:78VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 78. - Let the proud be ashamed; i.e. put them to shame (comp. Psalm 35:4, 26; Psalm 40:14; Psalm 70:2; Psalm 83:17, etc.). For they dealt perversely with me without a cause; rather, for with lies they subvert me (comp. ver. 69). But I will meditate in thy precepts. Repeated from ver. 15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:79VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 79. - Let those that fear thee turn unto me; or, \"return to me;\" i.e. recover their confidence in me, when they see that I am not forsaken of thee (see vers. 76, 77), but am the recipient of thy \"tender mercies.\" And those that have known thy testimonies; or, according to another reading, \"and let them know thy testimonies;\" i.e. \"let them learn from my experience to know thy precepts better.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:80VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 80. - Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; or, \"perfect in thy statutes\" - in the knowledge and in the practice of them. That I be not ashamed (see ver. 31)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:81VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCAPH. My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 81. - My soul fainteth for thy salvation (comp. Psalm 84:2). The phrase used expresses the most intense desire possible. But I hope in thy Word. (So also ver. 74.) While almost fainting, the psalmist is sustained by his hope and trust in God's promises.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:82VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 82. - Mine eyes fail for thy Word. Yet even here his \"eyes fail\" - he has looked so long for the aid promised, and it has not come. Saying, When wilt thou comfort me? \"Lord, how long?\" is the constant cry of God's servants under affliction or persecution. When will relief come and the tyranny be overpast?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:83VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 83. - For I am become like a bottle in the smoke. Keble's paraphrase brings out the true sense -NEWLINENEWLINE\"As wine-skin in the smoke,NEWLINEMy heart is sere and dried.\" Wine-skins were smoked to toughen and harden them. Yet do I not forget thy statutes. The severity of the discipline does not alienate me from thee, or cause me to depart from thy Law (comp. vers. 23, 51, 161).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:84VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 84. - How many are the days of thy servant? i.e. How little of my life is left! If thou delayest much longer, my days will all be gone. When writ thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? (see the comment on ver. 82b).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:85VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 85. - The proud have digged pits for me; i.e. \"have set traps to catch me\" (comp. Psalm 7:15; Psalm 9:15). Which are not after thy Law. God's Law is opposed to all underhand and treacherous dealing - therefore to all traps and snares.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:86VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 86. - All thy commandments are faithful; literally, are faithfulness. This is said in respect of the promises attached to them. They (i.e. my enemies) persecute me wrongfully; or, \"with lies\" - lyingly (comp. vers. 69, 78). Help thou me; i.e. help me against them, so that their \"lies\" may do me no harm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:87VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 87. - They had almost consumed me upon earth; or, \"made an end of me,\" \"destroyed me.\" But I forsook not thy precepts (comp. vers. 69, 78, 83). Persecution made the psalmist cling the more to God's Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:88VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTQuicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 88. - Quicken me after thy loving-kindness (comp. vers. 25, 37, 44, 107, 149, 156, 159). So shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth (compare \"the law of thy mouth,\" in ver. 72). It is God's \"quickening\" - i.e. his life-giving grace - which alone enables his servants to observe and keep his commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:89VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLAMED. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 89. - Forever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in heaven. God's Word, or Law, is eternal and unchanging - fixed and established forever in the heaven of heavens (comp. Psalm 89:2; James 1:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:90VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 90. - Thy faithfulness is unto all generations. God \"keepeth his promise forever\" (Psalm 146:6, Prayer-book Version). If his \"Word\" generally is unchanging, so especially must be his promises. Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. Even God's physical laws have a character of perpetuity about them. \"The constancy of God in his works is an argument for the faithfulness of God in his Word\" (Chalmers).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:91VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 91. - They continue this day according to thine ordinances. Heaven and earth continue to observe the ordinances given them by God at the first (comp. Jeremiah 31:35, 36; Jeremiah 33:25). For all are thy servants; rather, all things, or all creatures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:92VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 92. - Unless thy Law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction (comp. vers. 16, 24, 35, 47, 70, 77). Only a real love of God's commandments can sustain men under severe affliction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:93VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 93. - I will never forget thy precepts (comp. vers. 16, 61, 83). For with them thou hast quickened me (comp. ver. 50, \"Thy Word hath quickened me\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:94VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 94. - I am thine, save me. \"Save me,\" i.e. as being thine own - thy true servant and follower. For I have sought thy precepts. And thus shown my fidelity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:95VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 95. - The wicked have waited for me to destroy me; or, \"laid in wait for me\" (comp. Psalm 56:6, where the same verb is used). But I will consider thy testimonies I will look to thy word of promise, and so sustain their assaults upon me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:96VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 96. - I have seen an end of all perfection; i.e. to all other perfection I have seen, and see, a limit; but there is no limit to the perfection of thy Law. Thy commandment is exceeding broad. Unlimited - measureless in its range. It inculcates on man an absolute perfection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:97VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMEM. O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 97. - O how love I Thy law! (comp. vers. 47, 48, 113, 119, 127, etc.). As the psalmist goes on with his meditation he becomes more and more rated with a deep love of the Law of God, which is not to him a restraint or a burden, but a solace and a \"delight.\" It is my meditation all the day (see ver. 15, 23, 48, 78, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:98VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 98. - Thou through thy command-meets but made me wiser than mine enemies (comp. Deuteronomy 4:6, 8). The knowledge of God's Law gives a wisdom and an understanding infinitely above the cunning and craft of worldly men. If to the knowledge is added a faithful and habitual obedience, a wisdom is attained which can be reached in no other way (see ver. 100). For they are ever with me. Always present to my thoughts, as my rule of life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:99VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 99. - I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. Teachers of secular knowledge are intended, wise in their special branches of learning, but not \"wise unto salvation.\" Such \"teachers\" have often no spiritual knowledge or discernment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:100VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 100. - I understand more than the ancients; or, \"the aged.\" Advanced age does not necessarily give wisdom (see Job 32:7-9). \"Antiquity is no help against stupidity\" (Luther). Because I keep thy precepts (comp. ver. 104 and John 7:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:101VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 101. - I have refrained my feet from every evil way. This had been the psalmist's intention and endeavor, but he had not always succeeded in carrying it out (see vers. 67, 176). That I might keep thy Word. God's Word is not kept by such as allow themselves in any evil way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:102VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 102. - I have not departed from thy judgments (comp. vers. 30, 31, 51, 157, 168, etc.). For thou hast taught me. Thy teaching, thy guidance, thy help, have kept me straight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:103VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 103. - How sweet are thy words unto my taste! (comp. vers. 14, 16, 40, 47, etc.). The metaphor is new, but the sentiment one which pervades the psalm. Yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth. So David, in the nineteenth psalm, speaking of the judgments of God, says that they are \"sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:104VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrough thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 104. - Through thy precepts I get understanding (see the comment on vers. 98 and 100). Therefore I hate every false way. A \"false way\" is one that leads to error and sin (comp. vers. 29 and 128).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:105VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 105. - Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. It shows me the way wherein I should go, both night and day (comp. Proverbs 6:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:106VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 106. - I have sworn, and I will perform it; rather, I have sworn and am steadfastly purposed (see the Prayer-book Version). That I will keep thy righteous judgments; literally, the judgments of thy righteousness; i.e. the judgments which thy righteousness has caused thee to put forth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:107VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 107. - I am afflicted very much (comp. vers. 23, 28, 50, 51, 61, 71, 78, etc.). Spoken against by princes, reproached by the proud, persecuted without a cause, the psalmist felt his \"affliction\" to be grievous, almost intolerable. Being brought near to death, he prays for a \"little reviving.\" Quicken me, O Lord, according unto thy Word (comp. vers. 25, 37, 40, 88, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:108VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 108. - Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord; i.e. my prayers and praises. The lifting up of the hands to God is a kind of sacrifice (Psalm 141:2). And teach me thy judgments. And, in return, make me to understand thy statutes (comp. vers. 12, 26, 33, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:109VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 109. - My soul is continually in my hand; i.e. my life is in constant jeopardy (comp. Judges 12:3; 1 Samuel 19:5; 1 Samuel 28:21). Yet do I not forget thy Law (comp. vers. 16, 83, 93, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:110VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 110. - The wicked have laid a snare for me (comp. vers. 85, 95). Yet I erred not from thy precepts. I have not allowed their machinations to interfere with my obedience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:111VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 111. - Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage forever. I regard thy Law as my best and most valuable inheritance - one with which I am resolved never to part. For they are the rejoicing of my heart. My chief joy and delight (comp. vers. 16, 24, 35, 47, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:112VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 112. - I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes always (comp. vers. 34, 44, etc.). Even unto the end. The end of life is probably meant, as in ver. 33.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:113VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSAMECH. I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 113. - I hate vain thoughts; rather, unstable or double-minded men (Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version); i.e. \"those who are undecided in religion\" (Cheyne). But thy Law do I love (comp. vers. 97, 119, 127, 159, 163). There is nothing \"unstable\" or ',double-minded\" in thy Law. It is clear direct, unmistakable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:114VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 114. - Thou art my Hiding-place (comp. Psalm 27:5; Psalm 32:7; Psalm 91:1). And my Shield; i.e. my protection (see Psalm 3:3; Psalm 18:2, 30, etc.). I hope in thy Word. The promises contained in thy Word are my only sure hope (see ver. 43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:115VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDepart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 115. - Depart from me, ye evildoers. There is no fellowship between light and darkness, between righteousness and unrighteousness (2 Corinthians 10:16). Good men must separate themselves from those who are manifestly workers of iniquity (comp. Psalm 6:8). For I will keep the commandments of my God (see ver. 106). Association with the wicked hinders men from keeping God's Law. Not only is there the danger of corruption (1 Corinthians 15:3;); but, at the best, attention is distracted, and energies weakened.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:116VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 116. - Uphold me according unto thy Word, that I may live; or, \"according to thy promise.\" God's sustaining grace, always needed to \"uphold\" the righteous, is graciously \"promised\" them. Their \"life\" depends upon God's faithfulness to his promise. And let me not be ashamed of my hope. As he would be, if God's promise were not kept.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:117VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 117. - Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; i.e. from falling away. And I will have respect unto thy commandments continually (comp. ver. 112).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:118VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 118. - Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes; rather, thou despisest all them that go astray from thy statutes. Thou makest light of them. The LXX. have, ἐξουδένωσας For their deceit is falsehood. \"Their subtle policy is but a lie\" (Kay). It rests on lies, and ends in disappointment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:119VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 119. - Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross. The wicked are ultimately separated from the righteous, and cast away \"as dross,\" since they can serve no good end (comp. Matthew 13:30, 49, 50). Therefore I love thy testimonies. Not because the wicked suffer, but because they are prevented from injuring the righteous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:120VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 120. - My flesh trembleth for fear of thee (comp. Isaiah 6:5; Jeremiah 23:9; Habakkuk 3:16), And I am afraid of thy judgments. Thy \"judgments\" upon the wicked cause me to shudder with fear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:121VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAIN. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 121. - I have done judgment and justice (comp. vers. 30, 31, 55, 56, etc). Leave me not to mine oppressors; rather, thou wilt not leave me to mine oppressors. The nexus of the thought seems to be, \"As I have not oppressed any, so wilt thou not suffer me to be crushed by oppression.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:122VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 122. - Be surety for thy servant for good (comp. Job 17:3; Isaiah 38:14). \"For good\" means \"so that it may be well with him.\" Let not the proud oppress me (comp. vers. 51, 69, 78, 85, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:123VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 123. - Mine eyes fail for thy salvation; i.e. through looking for it, and vainly expecting it (comp. vers. 81, 82). And for the word of thy righteousness; i.e. and through looking for the fulfillment of thy righteous promises.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:124VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 124. - Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy (comp. vers. 41, 77). And teach me thy statutes. This phrase occurs so often that it becomes a sort of refrain (comp. vers. 11, 26, 33, 64, 68, 108, 135).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:125VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 125. - I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. As thy servant (see vers. 17, 23, 38, 49, 65, etc.), I have a claim upon thee for thy help. What I ask is discernment - to understand the full meaning of thy Law (comp. vers. 34, 66, 73, 1440.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:126VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 126. - It is time for thee, Lord, to work; or, \"to act;\" i.e. to lay aside quiescence, and come forward as the active Ruler of the universe. For they have made void thy Law. The wicked have cast thy Law behind their back, and, so far as lay in their power, \"made it void\" - repealed it, cancelled it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:127VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 127. - Therefore I love thy commandments. Because the wicked \"make void\" thy commandments and cast them aside, \"therefore\" I all the more \"love\" them. Above gold; yea, above fine gold (comp. ver. 72).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:128VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 128. - Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right. I do not pick and choose among thy commandments which I will neglect and which I will obey, but esteem them all as perfect, and obey them all. \"Eclecticism of every kind in reference to the Word of God is rejected\" (Hengstenberg). And I hate every false way (comp. vers. 104, 163). All ways are \"false\" except the way of God's commandmentsNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:129VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPE. Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 129. - Thy testimonies are wonderful; literally, wonders; i.e. prodigies of moral excellence. Therefore doth my soul keep them. I obey thy Law, not only because it is thy Law, but still more because it is intrinsically \"holy, just, and good\" (Romans 7:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:130VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 130. - The entrance of thy words giveth light; rather, the opening (or opening up) of thy words. Their full exposition and interpretation (comp. vers. 98-100, 104, 105, etc.). It giveth understanding to the simple (comp. Psalm 19:7; Proverbs 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:131VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 131. - I opened my mouth, and panted (comp. Psalm 38:10). The idea intended to be expressed is that of earnest and eager desire.

As thou usest to do unto those that love thy Name; literally, as thy rule is with those that love thy Name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:133VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOrder my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 133. - Order my steps in thy Word; perhaps rather, establish my steps by thy Word (comp. Psalm 40:2). And let not any iniquity (i.e., any wicked persons) have dominion over me. The prayer is not for deliverance from internal corruption, but from the external oppression of enemies (see the next verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:134VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 134. - Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. Out of gratitude for thy interposition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:135VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 135. - Make thy face to shine upon thy servant (comp. Psalm 4:6; Psalm 44:3, etc.). And teach me thy statutes (see the comment on ver. 124).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:136VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 136. - Rivers of water s run down mine eyes; literally, mine eyes run down [with] rivers of water (comp.

With God there is \"no variableness, neither shadow of turning\" (James 1:27). His righteousness (צדקה) is pure abstract right (צדק), one and the same always - not shifting, like human ideas of justice. And thy Law is the truth. An embodiment of that immutable morality which rests upon a basis of absolute eternal truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:143VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 143. - Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me (comp. vers. 22, 23, 28, 50, 51, 61, 67, 69, etc.). Yet thy commandments are my delight. I am happy in the midst of my troubles, for the joy that I have in thy Word (see vers. 16, 35, 47, 77, 174).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:144VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 144. - The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting (comp. vers. 138, 142, 152). Give me understanding, and I shall live; i.e. \"give me full understanding of thy commandments, of their depth and breadth and exceeding excellence.\" Then shall I truly \"live.\" My spirit will shake off its torpor, and be quickened into a \"life\" that will deserve the name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:145VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKOPH. I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 145. - I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord. \"Earnest and patient prayer for grace\" (Kay) seems to be intended, not mere prayer for deliverance. I will keep thy statutes. If thou hearest and answerest my prayer, I shall have both the will and the power to keep thy commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:146VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 146. - I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. The thought of ver. 145 is repeated in other words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:147VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 147. - I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried (comp. ver. 62). Evening, morning, and noonday were the three usual times of prayer (Psalm 55:17). The writer could not wait for morning. Either he woke up to pray at midnight, or at any rate he anticipated the dawn, and began his morning prayer while it was still dark. I hoped in thy Word. Hope was so strong in him that it did not suffer him to rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:148VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 148. - Mine eyes prevent the night watches. As ver. 146 is a repetition of ver. 145, so this verse is very nearly a repetition of ver. 147. The only change of idea is in the second clause - that I might meditate in thy Word; or, \"on thy promise\" - which makes meditation rather than prayer the psalmist's object in his early rising.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:149VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 149. - Hear my voice according unto thy loving-kindness; i.e. \"hear me, and, according to thy mercy, grant my prayer.\" O Lord, quicken me according to thy judgment; or, \"according to the rules that thou settest thyself\" (comp. ver. 132).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:150VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 150. - They draw nigh; i.e. come near me to threaten me. That follow after mischief; or, \"after wickedness.\" They are far from thy Law (comp. vers. 21, 53, 118, 126, 136, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:151VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 151. - Thou art near, O Lord. If \"they draw nigh,\" still more near art thou, ready to succor and defend and save (comp. Psalm 145:18). And all thy commandments are truth (comp. ver. 142, \"Thy Law is the truth;\" and see the comment on that passage).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:152VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 152. - Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them forever; rather, from thy testimonies. The study of God's commandments has long ago convinced the psalmist that they are no passing or temporary enactments, but eternal laws, decreed and laid down forever. The \"testimonies\" spoken of are, of course, the moral precepts of the Law, not its economical or political enactments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:153VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRESH. Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 153. - Consider mine affliction (see above, vers. 50, 67, 71, 75, 92, etc.). And deliver me. The \"affliction\" intended is that which the psalmist suffers at the hands of his enemies, who \"reproach\" him (ver. 22), \"deride\" him (ver. 51), and otherwise \"persecute\" him (ver. 161). For I do not forget thy Law (comp. vers. 16, 83, 93, 109, 141, 176).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:154VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPlead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 154. - Plead my cause (comp. Psalm 35:1; Psalm 43:1; Micah 7:9). God \"pleads the cause\" of his servants when he takes up their quarrel, and avenges them upon their enemies. And deliver me; or, \"rescue me\" (Cheyne). Quicken me according to thy Word (comp. ver. 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:155VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSalvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 155. - Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. \"Salvation\" is only attainable by man through obedience to the commandments of God. If men will not even \"seek\" to know and do his commandments, they put \"salvation\" from them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:156VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreat are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 156. - Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord; rather, many (comp. Psalm 25:6, and note the antithesis between this verse and the next, \"Many are thy mercies:\" \"Many are my persecutors\"). Quicken me according to thy judgments (comp. ver. 149).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:157VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 157. - Many are my persecutors and mine enemies. Hitherto this had been implied (vers. 22, 23, 51, 61, etc.) rather than expressed. Now the thought of Psalm 25:18 comes over the writer, \"Consider mine enemies, for they are many.\" Yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. Repeated from ver. 51.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:158VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 158. - I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; literally, the treacherous dealers - those who dealt treacherously against the Divine covenant. Because they kept not thy Word (comp. ver. 136).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:159VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConsider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 159. - Consider how I love thy precepts (comp. vers. 97, 113, 119, 127, 163). Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy loving-kindness. Slightly varied from ver. 149.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:160VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 160. - Thy Word is true from the beginning; rather, the sum of thy Word is truth. (So Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version.) \"After examining the Divine Word, and estimating the value of its several parts, the psalmist found that the final sum was 'truth - pure, absolute truth\" (Kay). And every one of thy righteous judgments endureth forever. An emphatic repetition of the statement made in ver. 144.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:161VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSCHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 161. - Princes have persecuted me without a cause. The \"princes\" may be either foreign or native; but from ver. 23 it would rather appear that native princes are intended. But my heart standeth in awe of thy Word. Yet I do not fear them, or heed what they say. Of nothing do I stand in awe, except \"thy Word.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:162VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 162. - I rejoice at thy Word, as one that findeth great spoil. We must not limit this to the promises contained in God's Law. The psalmist views the precepts of the Law as a real treasure (vers. 14, 72, 127), since they make him wise unto salvation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:163VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 163. - I hate and abhor lying; or, \"falsehood.\" False systems of religion are in the psalmist's thoughts; or, at any rate, false moral teaching, lie is not speaking of the habit of lying. But thy Law do I love (see the comment on ver. 159).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:164VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 164. - Seven times a day do I praise thee; i.e. repeatedly, an indefinite number of times (comp. Psalm 12:6; Psalm 79:11; Proverbs 24:16). Because of thy righteous judgments (comp. vers. 137, 160).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:165VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreat peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 165. - Great peace have they which love thy Law (comp. Proverbs 3:1, 2; Isaiah 32:17; James 3:18). There is always disquietude where there is sin. A sense of perfect peace and rest belongs to those who love and keep God's Law. And nothing shall offend them; rather, and they shall have no stumbling-block. Nothing shall cause them to stumble, much less to fall away from grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:166VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 166. - Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation (comp. vers. 81, 123). I have waited for thee, continually expecting thee to come to my aid, and save me from my enemies. And done thy commandments; kept them, i.e., as far as human frailty would allow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:167VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 167. - My soul hath kept thy testimonies. In will and intention I have always been faithful unto thee; I have striven to keep all thy commandments. And I love them exceedingly (comp. vers. 97, 127, 159, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:168VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 168. - I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies (comp. vers. 166,167). The assertion is made more broadly than a Christian would make it. But there is no intention to claim absolute perfection (see vers. 67, 71, 116, 117, 133, 176, etc.). For all my ways are before thee. Knowing that nothing which I do, or say, or think is hidden from thee, I have striven to keep thy Law in thought and word and deed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:169VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTAU. Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 169. - Let my cry come near before thee, O Lord. The \"cry\" is probably for deliverance from his enemies (see ver. 166); but this, he feels, depends upon his own faithfulness. Hence the prayer in the second clause, Give me understanding according to thy Word (comp. ver. 144).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:170VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 170. - Let my supplication come before thee. A repetition of the \"cry\" in the preceding verse, which is distinctly shown by the next clause to be a cry for deliverance - Deliver me according to thy Word; or, \"according to thy promise\" (imrathka). God had \"promised\" to deliver all those who in the day of trouble should call upon him (Psalm 50:15; Psalm 91:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:171VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 171. - My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes; rather, let my lips pour forth praise, for thou teachest me thy statutes. The psalmist feels that his prayer for enlightenment (ver. 169b) is answered, or just about to be answered, and that therefore it behooves him to gush forth with praise like a fountain (comp. ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:172VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 172. - My tongue shall speak of thy Word; or, \"let my tongue respond to thy promise \" - return praise, i.e., for the fulfillment of thy promise. For all thy commandments are righteousness. And therefore are worthy objects of praise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:173VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 173. - Let thine hand help me; literally, be to help me; i.e. be ever ready to help me. For I have chosen thy precepts. I have cast aside all other helpers, and have pinned my faith on thee and thy Word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:174VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 174. - I have longed for thy salvation, O Lord (comp. vers. 81, 166). And thy Law is my delight (see vers. 16, 35, 47, 70. 77, 111).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:175VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 175. - Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; i.e. \"quicken me; give me true life in my soul and spirit - my real self - and then my praise shall be ever of thee.\" And let thy judgments help me. Let the course of thy providence be such as to help me to praise thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm119:176VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 176. - I have gone astray like a lost sheep (comp. ver. 67). Some see in this verse nothing but a reference to the outward circumstances of the psalmist's life. But this is certainly not the idea generally attached in Scripture to the image of the \"lost sheep\" (see Isaiah 53:6; Jeremiah 1:6; Luke 15:4-7; 1 Peter 2:25). Dean Johnson's exposition is probably correct, \"I have wandered far from thee and from home, as a sheep lost and ready to perish in the wilderness.\" Seek thy servant. \"Seek him, lest he be not able of himself to seek thee; and bring him again to thy fold.\" For I do not forget thy commandments. In my worst wanderings I have not fallen away wholly from thee. Thy Law has been ever in my thoughts. I have not \"forgotten\" it, but meditated on it and longed for it (vers. 15, 20, 40).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the Lord put I my trust; or, in the Lord have I taken refuge (Kay, Cheyne). Before his friends address him on the subject of his danger, David has himself recognized it, and has fled to God for succour. How say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain? rather, flee ye, birds, to your mountain. Probably a proverbial expression, used when it was necessary to warn a man that in flight lay his only safety. The singular (צִפור) is used collectively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For, lo, the wicked bend their bow. The words are still those of the timid friends. \"Lo,\" they say, \"the ungodly are already bending the bow against thee\" - preparing, i.e., to attempt thy life. They make ready their arrow upon the string; or, fit their arrow to the string. The last thing before discharging it. That they may privily shoot at the upright in heart; literally, that they may shoot amid darkness at the upright in heart (comp. 1 Samuel 19:1, 2, where, Saul having given orders to \"all his servants, that they should kill David,\" Jonathan persuades him to hide himself \"until the morning\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? The word translated\" foundations\" is a rare one, only occurring here and in Isaiah 19:10. The meaning of \"foundations,\" first given to it by Aquila, is now generally adopted. We must suppose the timid friends to be still speaking, and to mean that, under the lawless rule of Saul, the very foundations of society and of moral order were swept away; the righteous (צַדִּיק, a collective) had done and could do nothing to prevent it. What remained for David, but to withdraw from a community where there was neither law nor order, where the first magistrate commanded (1 Samuel 19:1) and attempted (1 Samuel 19:10) assassination?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord is in his holy temple. David's reply to his timid advisers is an expression of absolute faith and trust in God. Saul may reign upon earth; but Jehovah is in his holy temple (or rather, \"palace,\" הֵיכַל) on high - his throne is in heaven, where he sits and reigns. What need, then, to fear an earthly king? Especially when God is not inattentive to human affairs, but his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men (comp. Psalm 7:9; Psalm 17:3; Psalm 139:1). His \"eyelids\" are said to try men, because, when we closely scrutinize a thing, we drop our eyelids and half close our eyes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord trieth the righteous. God tries the righteous, scrutinizing them with his penetrating glance, but a glance wherein there is protection and love. When he tries (or closely scrutinizes) the wicked, the result is different - the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Upon the wicked he shall rain snares. On Divine displeasure follows Divine punishment - not always speedy, but sure. Those who have plotted against David will have\" snares rained\" upon them. God is said to \"rain\" on men both his blessings and his curses, when he gives them abundantly (comp. Job 20:23; Hosea 10:12; Ezekiel 34:26). By \"snares\" are meant any difficulties or troubles in which men are entangled by the action of Divine providence. Fire and brimstone. The punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah was the typical example of God's vengeance to the Israelites generally. And an horrible tempest; literally, a breath of horrors (comp. Psalm 119:53; Lamentations 5:10). It is thought that the simoom may be intended. But none of the threats are to be taken literally. All that the psalmist means is that God's vengeance, in some shape or ether, will overtake his persecutors. This shall be the portion of their cup. This is probably the earliest place where the metaphor of a \"cup\" for man's lot in life is employed. Other instances are Psalm 16:5; Psalm 23:5; Psalm 73:10; Psalm 75:8; Psalm 116:13; Isaiah 51:17, 22; Jeremiah 25:15; Ezekiel 23:31, 32; Matthew 20:22, 23; Matthew 26:39; John 18:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; rather, for the Lord is righteous; he loveth righteousness (see the Revised Version); literally, righteousnesses; i.e. good and righteous deeds. His countenance doth behold the upright. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, and ethers; but the bulk of modern commentators prefer to render, \"The upright will behold his countenance.\" Either translation yields a good sense.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.120":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me. The particular \"distress' intended can only be conjectured. Some suppose it to be the Captivity itself, others the opposition offered by the Samaritans, Ammonites, and others to the rebuilding of the temple (Ezra 4, 5.) and restoration of the wails of Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2:19, 20; Nehemiah 4:1-23; Nehemiah 6:2-14). But these guesses are scarcely of much value.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips. Such as Sanballat's (Nehemiah 6:6 - 8). And from a deceitful tongue; literally, a tongue that is fraud - a mere variant of the expression in the preceding clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - What shall be given unto thee? rather, what shall he (i.e. God) give to thee? Or, in other words - What punishment will God inflict on thee for thy false speaking? Or what shall be done unto thee? literally, or what shall he add to thee? Compare the common phrase, \"God do so unto me, and more also\" (1 Samuel 3:17; 1 Samuel 14:44). Thou false tongue. The \"false tongue\" is apostrophized, as if it were a living person.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Sharp arrows of the mighty. The psalmist answers his own questions. Sharp-pointed arrows of a Mighty One shall be given thee, and added to them shall be coals of juniper. God, i.e., shall punish thee with extreme severity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech. This is scarcely to be understood literally. Israel never \"sojourned in Mesech,\" i.e. among the Moschi, who dwelt in Cappadocia, nor dwelt among the tents of Kedar, a people of Northern Arabia. The writer means that he dwells among hostile and barbarous people, who are to him as Kedar and Mesech. Possibly the Samaritans and Ammonites are intended. That I dwell in the tents of Kedar; rather, among the tents (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace; i.e. with the tribes symbolized in the preceding verse by the names \"Mesech\" and \"Kedar,\" the tribes bordering upon Judea. These were from first to last almost always at war with Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm120:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I am for peace; literally, I am peace; but the meaning is as given in the Authorized Version. But when I speak (i.e. when I speak to them of peace), they are for war; i.e. they are utterly averse to peace, and are bent on continual hostility. The general history bears out this statement. There is only one apparent exception. When the Jews returned from the Captivity and began to build the temple, the Samaritans offered to join with them (Ezra 4:2). But the Samaritan offer was, perhaps, insincere. At any rate, when it was refused, they became the most bitter opponents of the Jews.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.121":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm121:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.

This last has sometimes been doubted, but the observation of modern travelers seems to show that bad effects actually fellow on sleeping in the moonlight in hot countries (see Curzon's 'Travels,' p. 36; Leopolt, 'India Missions,' p. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm121:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; or, \"keep thee.\" The same verb is used throughout.

Deuteronomy 28:6; 1 Samuel 29:6; 2 Samuel 3:25; 1 Kings 3:7; 2 Kings 19:27). The phrase is an equivalent of \"The Lord shall preserve thee in all thy ways\" (Psalm 91:11). From this time forth, and even forevermore; i.e. so long as thou hast \"goings out\" and \"comings in.\" But the phrase used rather implies that these will never cease.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.122":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm122:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I was glad when they said unto us, Let us go into the house of the Lord (comp.

The primary reference is probably to the compact shape and look of the ancient city, which, as Josephus says, was \"one and entire,\" with no straggling suburbs, shut in on the north by a wall, and on the three other sides both by walls and by deep, rocky valleys. But the material \"compactness\" was perhaps taken to symbolize the close internal union of the inhabitants one with another, whereby they were all knit together into one Church and people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm122:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord. This points to a time before the dispersion of \"the tribes,\" which rendered such regular \"going up\" impossible. Unto the testimony of Israel; rather, as a testimony unto Israel - a witness to the whole nation that all Israelites had covenant privileges at Jerusalem. To give thanks unto the Name of the Lord. The three great feasts whereto Israel was bound to \"go up\" were all of them seasons of thanksgiving.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm122:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.

But the plural may be \"a plural of dignity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm122:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Let all true Israelites \"pray for the peace of Jerusalem,\" i.e. for her tranquility and for her prosperity. They shall prosper that love thee. A covert threat, as well as a promise. \"Such as love Jerusalem, and pray for her peace, shall prosper; such as do not love her shall lack prosperity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm122:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPeace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

The tabernacle set up by David in Jerusalem is called \"the house of the Lord\" in Psalm 5:7; Psalm 27:4; Psalm 52:8; and Psalm 55:14. God \"dwelt there,\" as he dwelt in the tabernacle of Moses in the wilderness (Exodus 40:34, 35) and in the temple of Solomon subsequently (2 Chronicles 5:13, 14).

Watch, i.e., for the slightest sign that he may give of his will. Such signs were usually given by some movement of the \"hand.\" And as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress. Masters were waited on by male slaves; their wives by handmaids - both equally anxious to do their will, and therefore equally watchful of all the signs that indicated it.

The cry is repeated for greater emphasis. For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. This expression can scarcely be said to fix the date of the psalm, since hatred and contempt were the usual feelings wherewith the Jews were regarded by their neighbors.

A sudden and startling change of metaphor. In the quick transition of Oriental thought, the fire becomes a flood - an irresistible torrent-stream, carrying all before it (comp.

The second point of blessedness is a fruitful wife, content to dwell in the female apartments of the house, to keep at home (Titus 2:5) and guide the household. Thy children like olive plants; or, \"olive shoots\" - the vigorous offsets from an aged olive tree, which spring up around it, ready to take its place. Round about thy table.

Contrast the injunction of the apostle (Ephesians 4:25). With flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak; literally, with lips of smoothness, and with a heart and a heart do they speak.

Success in pleading before courts of law is, perhaps, included. Our lips are our own; literally, are with us; i.e. are on our side, are our helpers (\"Nobis auxilio et praesto sunt,\" Michaelis). Who is lord over us? Who, i.e., can interfere with us and impede our action?

The ungodly having been threatened, a promise of assistance is made to the righteous whom they oppress. God declares that, in response to the many calls made upon him (Psalm 3:7; Psalm 7:6; Psalm 9:19; Psalm 10:12), he will \"now,\" at last, \"arise\" - interpose on behalf of the oppressed, and deliver them (comp. Exodus 3:7, 8). I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.

God having promised to set the righteous, who are oppressed, in a place of safety (ver. 5), the psalmist is sure that he will keep them and preserve them from the wicked \"generation,\" which has possession of the earth, and bears rule in it, always. It is, no doubt, for the greater consolation and encouragement of these unfortunates that he dwells on the subject, and adds his own assurances to the Divine promise which he has recorded. Man's faith is so weak that, unless promises and assurances are reiterated, they make little impression. Thou shalt preserve them (Hebrew, him) from this generation for ever. The \"generation\" is that of the worldly men in power at the time, of whom we have heard in Psalm 3:1, 2, 6, 7; Psalm 4:2; Psalm 5:4-6, 9, 10; Psalm 6:8; Psalm 7:1, 2, 9, 13-16; Psalm 10:2-11, 15; Psalm 11:2, 3, 6. \"For ever\" means \"so long as they live.\" The substitution of \"him' for \"them\" in this clause is an instance of that generalization by which a whole class is summed up in a single individual - \" all men\" in \"man,\" \"all good men\" in \"the righteous\" (צַדִּיק), and the like.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The wicked walk on every side. This can scarcely have been intended as an independent clause, though grammatically it stands alone. It is best to supply \"while\" or \"though\" before \"the wicked,\" as Dr. Kay does, and to translate, Though (or, while) wicked men march to and fro on all sides; i.e. while they have their way, and control all other men's incomings and out-goings, being free themselves.

Milton makes his Satan say, \"Then farewell hope, and, with hope, farewell fear!\" ('Paradise Lost,' canto 1.). And certainly the true fear of God, which Scripture requires in us - a reverential, loving fear - could not exist, unless we had a confident hope in God's mercy and willingness to forgive us our trespasses, if we turn to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm130:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait. \"Waiting for the Lord\" is patiently bearing our affliction, whatever it may be, and confidently looking forward to deliverance from it in God's good time. The expression, \"my soul doth wait,\" is stronger than \"I wait;\" it implies heart-felt trust and confidence.

Verse 1. - Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions; rather, remember to David all his affliction; i.e. reckon it to him, and reward him for it.

God approved David's zeal, but did not allow him to accomplish his design (2 Samuel 7:5-16).

The resting-place is, after a time, discovered and prepared. The ark is brought up and placed in it (1 Kings 8:1-11). The \"priests\" are\" clothed with righteousness,\" and the \"saints shout for joy.\" God \"turns not away the face of his anointed,\" but accepts the costly offering. God himself \"arises into his rest,\" and makes his presence visible from the mercy-seat (1 Kings 8:10, 11; 2 Chronicles 5:13, 14). Verse 6. - Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah. \"It\" is probably \"the ark\" - not yet mentioned, but a main object of the writer's thoughts; and \"Ephratah\" is the district south and west of Jerusalem, in which both Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim were situated. And found it in the fields of the wood; rather, in the fields of Jaar. \"Jaar\" is a contracted and poetic name for Kirjath-jearim, where the ark remained from its return out of the country of the Philistines till David transferred it to Jerusalem (1 Chronicles 13:5-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm132:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

The chief promise is that of a special \"fruit of his body\" to be \"set upon his throne\" (ver. 11) and to reign in Zion forever (vers. 13, 14). Verse 11. - The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David (comp. Psalm 89:3, 35). He will not turn from it. So it is said of another Divine oath, \"The Lord sware, and will not repent\" (Psalm 110:4).

The \"horn of David\" budded most gloriously when \"a rod came forth out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch grew out of his roots, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon him\" (Isaiah 11:1, 2) - in other words, when Messiah appeared, and re-established the Davidian kingdom, which thenceforth has endured, and will endure for ever. I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. The metaphor is changed; but the idea is the same. Christ's coming shed a glory on David's house, and on the temple, and on David himself, such as had never previously illumined them. David is often promised \"a lamp\" (1 Kings 11:36; 1 Kings 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19; 2 Chronicles 21:7).

The anointing oil of the sanctuary was an ointment composed of many \"precious\" ingredients, as myrrh, cinnamon, sweet calamus, and cassia, besides oil olive, which was its basis (Exodus 30:23, 24). Not only Aaron (Leviticus 8:12), but all later high priests, were anointed with it (Exodus 30:30). That ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard. This would be the natural result of a copious \"pouring\" of the oil upon the top of the head. Though not mentioned historically in Leviticus, it presents itself to the eye of the poet, on whose mental vision the whole scene rises. That went down to the skirts of his garments. Streamed even to the lower fringe of his long vesture (Kay). The high priest at his consecration was a type and symbol of unity. He bore on his breastplate the names of the twelve tribes, so that the holy oil, typical of the grace of God, when it was poured upon him, flowed down on all the tribes, diffusing everywhere an odor of fragrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm133:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion. The interpolation of the words, \"and as the dew,\" is quite unwarrantable, and spoils the sense. It substitutes duality for unity, and destroys the parity of the two illustrations. Translate, \"As the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion.\" The psalmist sees the moisture which fertilizes the Holy Land, and makes it the fertile land that it is, all given forth from Hermon, the one great mountain at its head. As Dr. Kay well observes, \"Physically, Hermon was to Canaan what Aaron was ceremonially to Israel - its head and crown, from which the fertilizing stores of heaven descended over the land. For not only does the one great river of Palestine, the Jordan, issue from the roots of Hermon, but the giant mountain is constantly gathering and sending off clouds, which float down even to Southern Zion.\" For there (i.e. in Zion) the Lord commanded the blessing, even life forevermore.

This is the first reason why Israel should praise God. Israel is his people, his chosen people, selected by him out of all the nations of the earth to be his own, his inheritance (Deuteronomy 4:20; Deuteronomy 7:6; Deuteronomy 14:2, 21, etc.). And Israel for his peculiar treasure (see Exodus 19:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. Here is the second reason why God should be praised - he is great, greater far than any other being - \"above all gods\" - \"more to be feared than all gods\" (Psalm 96:4). This greatness is shown, firstly, in his power over nature, which is the subject of vers. 7, 8; and secondly, in his dealings with mankind, which form the subject of vers. 8-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he (comp.

In heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. This is intended as a complete division of space:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the heavens above the earth;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the earth and seas, in the middle sphere; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the abysses, or depths below the earth, as far as they can be conceived of as extending.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth (comp.

He maketh lightnings for the rain. To accompany it, perhaps to give it its fertilizing qualities (see Dr. Kay's comment 'The Psalms,' p. 428). He bringeth the wind out of his treasuries (see Job 38:22, where God's \"treasuries\" for the snow and the hail are spoken of; and comp.

Exodus 12:29). The most stupendous of the plagues of Egypt is given the first place in the account of God's wonderful dealings with men, and especially with his people. It gave them the deliverance out of Egypt, which made them a people (Exodus 12:31-33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt; or, \"signs and wonders\" (comp.

Upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants; i.e. \"upon all his subjects.\" The plagues fell upon the whole people of Egypt (Exodus 7:21; Exodus 8:4, 11, 17, 24; Exodus 9:6, 11, 25; Exodus 10:6, 15; Exodus 12:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Who smote great nations (see Exodus 14:27, 28; Exodus 17:8-13; Numbers 21:24-30, 33-35; Joshua 8:21-26; Joshua 10:10, 11; Judges 4:10-16; Judges 7:19-23; Judges 11:32, 33; 1 Samuel 7:10-13; 2 Samuel 8:1-14; 2 Samuel 10:8-19; 1 Kings 20:1-30; 2 Kings 3:4-27; 2 Kings 14:25-28; 2 Kings 18:7, 8; 2 Kings 19:35; 2 Chronicles 14:9-15; 2 Chronicles 20:1-25, etc.).

The result of God's marvelous doings (vers. 6-12) is that \"his Name endureth forever\" - can never be forgotten - attracts to itself eternal praise and honor. And thy memorial (or, \"thy remembrance\") throughout all generations (comp. Psalm 102:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For the Lord will judge his people; i.e. will right them whenever they are wronged (see Exodus 2:23-25; Exodus 3:7-9; Exodus 6:6; Psalm 54:1-3). And he will repent himself concerning his servants. God \"will not keep his anger for ever\" (Psalm 103:9). When he has sufficiently chastised his sinful servants, he will \"repent,\" or \"relent\" (Kay, Cheyne), with respect to them, and receive them back into favor. The history contained in the Book of Judges strongly illustrates this statement (Judges 3:6-11, 12-30; Judges 4:1-3, 13-16; Judges 6:1-16; Judges 10:6-18; Judges 11:4-33; Judges 13:1-5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm135:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. A condensed recitation of Psalm 115:4-8 (comp. Jeremiah 10:3-5).

The concluding strain corresponds to the opening one, and is a simple hymn of praise. Israel generally, the priestly order, the Levites, and the devout worshippers of God, of whatever class, are called upon in succession to praise and bless Jehovah (comp. Psalm 115:9-11).

These would present themselves to the exiles as \"rivers.\" There we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. The exiles had their leisure hours - they were not kept by their masters at hard work continually. During these leisure hours they naturally \"sat down\" by the rivers of Babylon, as the most pleasant and attractive places.

The superfluous \"harps\" were \"hung\" up upon the trees that grew by the watercourses. These are called \"willows,\" or, according to some, \"poplars,\" but were probably of a different species from any of the trees that grew in Palestine. The chief Babylonian tree was the palm, which grew in the greatest luxuriance along the courses of all the streams (Herod., 1:193; Atom Man., 24:3; Zosim., 3. pp. 173-179).

The oppressors break into the retired gathering of their captives, and \"require of them a song\" - demand roughly and rudely to be entertained with the foreign music, which is perhaps sweeter than their own, or at any rate more of a novelty. And they that wasted us required us mirth. Not only was \"a song\" wanted but a joyous song - one that would wake feelings of mirth and gladness in those who heard it. Saying, sing us one of the songs of Zion; literally, sing us frown a song of Zion.

The psalmist prays God to \"remember\" this to Edom, and requite it upon her (comp. Psalm 132:1, where the same expression is used in a good sense). Who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof; i.e. \"destroy the city utterly - leave not one stone upon another.\" The enmity between Edom and Israel was of the intensest character (see 1 Kings 11:15, 16; 1 Chronicles 18:12; Jeremiah 49:7-22; Amos 1:11, 12; Malachi 1:3-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm137:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - O daughter of Babylon; i.e. O nation of the Babylonians (comp.

In the Archaemenian period it was one of the chief cities of the empire. Even under the Parthians it was still a flourishing town. But from the time of Isaiah's prophecy (Isaiah 13:1-22) it was a doomed city, and in the eyes of a devout Jew already \"desolate.\" Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us; i.e. happy shall he be that completes thy destruction, and the destruction of thy people.

They were especially shown to Israel in God's promises and his fidelity to them. For thou hast magnified thy Word above all thy Name. Some would amend the text, and read אמתך, \"thy truth,\" for, אמרתך \"thy Word.\" But if we keep the text, and understand אמרתך as \"thy promises,\" the sense will not be very different.

The promptness of thy answer gave my soul fresh strength.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm138:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord.

Isaiah 49:22, 23; Isaiah 60:8-5, etc.). For great is the glory of the Lord. (cf. Isaiah 60:1-3; Isaiah 66:18.)

Notwithstanding all God's glory and greatness, he condescends to look upon the lowly, to consider their needs, and to supply them (comp. Isaiah 57:15). Hence David feels sure that he will not be overlooked (see vers. 7, 8). But the proud he knoweth afar off. God keeps proud men at a distance, does not draw near to them, much less make his abode with them, but leaves them to themselves until they are ripe for punishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm138:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me (comp. Psalm 23:4). David \"walked in the midst of trouble\" during the greater part of his life. When the persecution of Saul was over, he had trouble from foreign enemies (2 Samuel 5-12.); when these were subdued, his domestic troubles began (2 Samuel 13-19; 1 Kings 5:53). God, however, from time to time \"gave him a reviving.\" Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies (comp. Psalm 3:7; Psalm 9:3-6; Psalm 18:14-17, etc.). What God had so often done for him, David is confident that he will do again. He will break the power of his enemies, and deliver him from their machinations. And thy right hand. The symbol of strength. Shall save me; or, \"deliver me\" (comp. Psalm 18:35; Psalm 60:5; Psalm 63:8; Psalm 108:6, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm138:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me; i.e. will complete what he has begun for me - will not leave his work unfinished (comp. Psalm 57:2; Philippians 1:6). Thy mercy, O Lord, endureth forever. Does not suddenly break off and stop. Forsake not the works of thine own hands. This is probably more than a mere personal request. David sees in God's care for himself a portion of his great providential scheme for the redemption of the world.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.139":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm139:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O Lord, thou hast searched me; rather, hast searched me out; i.e. examined into all my thoughts and feelings (comp.

The transition is now made from God's omniscience to God's omnipresence, ver. 5 having paved the way for it. God's presence is not to be escaped; his spirit is everywhere. \"In him we live, and move, and have our being\" (Acts 17:28). When Jonah sought to flee from his presence, he only found himself brought more absolutely and more perceptibly into his presence (comp.

Thy essential light penetrates every dark place, and makes the deepest gloom as radiant as the brightest sunshine.

The note of praise, which has rung through the whole poem in an undertone, is here openly struck. Reflections upon God's wonderful works must overflow into praise; and the phenomena of man's creation and birth are, at least, as calculated to call forth praise and adoration as any other. For I am fearfully and wonderfully made. The wonderfulness of the human mechanism is so great that, if realized, it produces a sensation of fear. It has been said that, if we could see one-half of what is going on within us, we should not dare to move. Marvelous are thy works; i.e. thy doings generally. And that my soul knoweth right well. The extent of the marvelousness I may not be able to comprehend; but at least I know the fact that they are marvelous, That fact I know \"right well.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm139:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret. The formation of the embryo in the womb seems to be intended. This remains as much a mystery as ever, notwithstanding all the pryings of modern science. And curiously wrought; literally, and embroidered, or woven with threads of divers colors (comp. ver. 13b; and note that modern science speaks of the various \"tissues\" of the human frame, and calls a portion of medical knowledge \"histology\"). In the lowest parts of the earth. This is scarcely to be taken literally. It is perhaps only a variant for the \"secretly\" of the preceding clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm139:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; or, \"my embryo.\" The Hebrew text has but the single word גלמי, which probably means, \"the still unformed embryonic mass\" (Hengstenberg). And in thy book all my members were written; literally, all of them; but the pronoun has no antecedent. Professor Cheyne and others suspect the passage to have suffered corruption. But the general meaning can scarcely have been very different from that assigned to the passage in the Authorized Version. Which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. Modern critics mostly translate \"the days,\" or \"my days,\" \"were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them;\" i.e. \"my life was planned out by God, and settled, before I began to be.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm139:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!

And thine enemies take thy Name in vain. The text must be altered to produce this meaning. As it stands, it can only be rendered, \"Thine enemies lift up [their scull to vanity\" (comp.

The psalmist claims to be of this number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm139:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I hate them with perfect hatred; i.e. with pure, absolute, intense hatred - a hatred commensurate with the love that he felt towards all God's saints. I count them mine enemies; i.e. I regard them as my private foes. I have the same feeling towards them as I have towards those who are at open enmity with me, and seek my destruction.

Examine me, and see if I have not represented my feelings as they really are. Keep on always searching me out (comp. ver. 1), and \"trying my reins and my heart\" (Psalm 26:2). My desire is to be proved and tested.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm139:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And see if there be any wicked way in me; literally, any way of grief. \"Ways of grief\" are ways which lead to grief, which involve either bitter repentance or severe chastisement. And lead me in the way everlasting; i.e. either \"the way that leadeth to everlasting life,\" or \"the good old way, the way that endures - the way of righteousness.\" David, with all his faults, is one of those who \"hunger and thirst after righteousness\" (Matthew 5:6).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord? for ever? God cannot forget, but man often feels as if he were forgotten of him (comp. Psalm 42:9; Psalm 44:24; Lamentations 5:20). David seems to have feared that God had forgotten him \"for ever.\" How long wilt then hide thy face from me! (comp. Psalm 30:7; Isaiah 1:15; Ezekiel 39:29). The \"light of God's countenance\" shining on us is the greatest blessing that we know (see Psalm 4:6; Psalm 31:18; Psalm 44:4; Psalm 67:1; Psalm 80:3, 7. etc.). When it is withdrawn, and he \"hides his face,\" we naturally sink into despair.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - How long shall I take counsel in my soul? or, How long shall I arrange plans? (Kay). Tossing on a sea of doubt and perplexity, David forms plan after plan, but to no purpose. He seeks to find a way of escape from his difficulties, but cannot discover one. Having sorrow in my heart daily; or, all the day. It is, perhaps, implied that the plans are formed and thought over at night. How long shall mine enemy be exalted ever me? A special enemy is once more glanced at. The allusion seems to be to Saul (comp. Psalm 7:2, 5, 11-16; Psalm 8:2; Psalm 9:6, 16; Psalm 10:2-11, 15; Psalm 11:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConsider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Consider and hear me, O Lord my God (comp. Psalm 5:1; Psalm 9:13; Psalm 141:1, etc.). David will not allow himself to be \"forgotten;\" he will recall himself to God's remembrance. \"Consider - hear me,\" he says, \"O Lord my God;\" still \"my God,\" although thou hast forgotten me, and therefore bound to \"hear me.\" Lighten mine eyes. Not so much \"enlighten me spiritually,\" as \"cheer me up; put brightness into my eyes; revive me\" (comp. Ezra 9:8, \"Grace hath been showed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape... that our God may lighten out eyes, and give us a little reviving\"). Lest I sleep the sleep of death; literally, lest I sleep death. Death is compared to a sleep by Job (Job 11:12), Jeremiah (Jeremiah 51:39, 57), Daniel (Daniel 12:2), and here by David, in the Old Testament; and by our Lord (John 11:11-13) and St. Paul in the New (1 Corinthians 11:30; 1 Corinthians 15:51; 1 Thessalonians 4:14, 15). The external resemblance of a corpse to a sleeping person was the root of the metaphor, and we shall do wrong to conclude from its employment anything with respect to the psalmist's views concerning the real nature of death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him. The triumph of David's enemy over him, whether he were Saul or any one else, even the ideal wicked man, would be the triumph of evil over good, of those who had cast God behind their back over those who faithfully served him, of irreligion over piety. He could therefore appeal to God - not in his own personal interest, but in the interest of truth and right, and the general good of mankind - to prevent his enemy's triumph. And those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. There would be a general rejoicing on the part of all his foes, if his arch-enemy succeeded in seriously injuring him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But I have trusted (or, I trust) in thy mercy.

I will exchange my cry of despair, \"How long?\" (vers. 1, 2), for a joyful song of thanksgiving; because already I am cheered, I am revived - he (i.e. the Lord) hath dealt bountifully with me.

The prayer is not directed against an individual, but against David's enemies generally. They are \"evil\" or \"wicked\" men, and especially \"men of violence\" (see the next clause, and comp. ver. 4).

Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle. In past combats thou hast protected me, as with a shield (Psalm 18:2; Psalm 33:20), wherefore I put the greater trust in thee for the future.

The \"head\" of David's enemies is put in contrast with his own \"head\" (see ver. 7). While God shields and protects his head, theirs has no protection, but the mischief of their own lips which covers them, but with confusion, rather than with defense or safety.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm140:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Let burning coals fall upon them, or, \"burning coals shall be thrown upon them.\" Let them be cast (or, \"they shall be cast\") into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again. The clauses are declaratory rather than optative. The psalmist sees the wrath of God poured out upon his enemies, who are at the same time God's enemies - they are cast into the fire prepared to receive the wicked - and plunged into deep pits whence they find it impossible to extricate themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm140:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth; literally, a man of tongue shall not be established is the land - a man, i.e., of pretence and seeming, who talks grandly, but effects nothing.

And the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. The hands were \"lifted up\" in prayer, which was reckoned a serf of sacrifice (Hosea 14:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm141:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSet a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips (comp. Psalm 39:1). David's was a hasty, impetuous temper, which required sharp control. He strove to \"keep his own mouth with a bridle\" - to \" be dumb with silence, and hold his peace\" - but this was not always possible for him of his own unassisted strength. He therefore makes his prayer to God for the Divine help.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm141:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIncline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Incline not my heart to any evil thing; i.e. let not my heart be inclined to any form of evil. To practice wicked works (rather, wicked practices) with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties.

And let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head; rather, which my head shall not refuse. The psalmist will prefer the reproof of the righteous to the dainty allurements of the wicked. He will regard their words as an oil of welcome, such as was poured upon the head of favored guests (Luke 7:36), and his head will not refuse it. For yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities; rather, their wickednesses. This healing oil will strengthen him to continue to pray for his enemies, even though they still continue in their \"wickednesses.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm141:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words. Calamity opens the heart to receive instruction. The \"judges\" - i.e. the leaders - among David's enemies are visited with a grievous calamity, expressed metaphorically by their being dashed upon rocks. This disposes them to listen to David's words, which are well worth listening to, since they are sweet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm141:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth. The calamity is not confined to the \"judges.\" The bones of the people generally lie scattered at hews mouth - unburied, i.e., but ready to go down to Hades. As when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth; rather, as when one cleaves and breaks up the earth. \"The bones of God's servants were strewn as thickly ever the ground as stones over a newly ploughed piece of soil, so that the Holy Land looked as if it had become an antechamber of Hades\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm141:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord. I, however, the psalmist says, do not despair - I look to thee, O Jehovah the Lord (comp. Psalm 40:7) - in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. The last clause is, literally, pour not out my soul; i.e. destroy me not - do not spill my life on the ground (comp.

I looked about, i.e., for human aid, but there was no one who would so much as know me. I was utterly deserted in my trouble. Refuge failed me. I had nowhere to flee unto - no safe and sure abiding-place. The \"cave of Adullam\" was but a miserable spot to hide in. No man cared for my soul; or, \"looked after my soul\" (comp. Jeremiah 30:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm142:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I cried unto thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my Refuge. When men's fathers and mothers forsake them, the Lord taketh them up (Psalm 27:10). David looked to God as a sure Refuge at all times (Psalm 9:9; Psalm 18:1, 2; Psalm 57:1; Psalm 59:9, 16, 17). And my Portion in the land of the living; or, \"my inheritance\" (comp.

In the cave of Adullam David had but four hundred outlaws to defend him against Saul, who was at the head of all the thousands of Israel (1 Samuel 22:2). Deliver me from my persecutors. Saul, Doeg, the Ziphites, and the armed bands with whom Saul \"hunted David in the mountains\" (1 Samuel 26:20).

The word \"prison\" is used symbolically, as a metaphor for trouble and distress (comp. Psalm 88:8; Psalm 107:10-14). That I may praise thy Name; or, \"that men may praise thy Name.\" David's deliverance from his enemies would cause the godly generally to \"praise the Lord.\" The righteous shall compass me about; rather, in me shall the righteous triumph (Kay, Cheyne). Viewing my cause as their own, they will glory in my deliverance (comp. Psalm 35:27; Psalm 40:16).

The psalmist, having touched the point of abstract justice, shrinks from pressing it. He knows that he is not \"righteous before God,\" and that his life and conduct \"cannot endure the severity of God's judgment\" (Art. XII.). He therefore \"deprecates a strictly retributive treatment\" (Cheyne). For in thy sight shall no man living be justified (comp.

He hath smitten my life down to the ground; or, \"crushed my life to the ground\" - brought me, i.e., very low (comp. Psalm 42:6). He hath made me to dwell in darkness (comp. Psalm 88:6). As those that have been long dead. I have dwelt in a darkness like that of Shell; i.e. in gloom and unhappiness (comp.

These recollections draw me to thee, O God, and make me stretch forth my hands in prayer to thee (Psalm 141:2b), and entreat thee for succor. My soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. As a parched and withered land. seems to look up to heaven and long for rain, so does my soul long for thee, O Lord, \"and thy refreshing grace\" (comp. Psalm 42:1). The \"pause-mark,\" \"selah,\" at the end of the verse, at once gives time for secret prayer, and makes a division of the psalm into two parts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm143:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Hear me speedily, O Lord. Here the direct supplication of ver. 1 is taken up, and pressed. \"Hear me, O Lord; and not only hear me, but that speedily. It is a time for haste\" (comp. Psalm 141:1). My spirit faileth; or, \"fainteth\" (LXX., ἐξέλιπε). Hide not thy face from me (comp. Psalm 27:9; Psalm 69:17; Psalm 102:2). Lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit (see the comment on Psalm 28:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm143:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning; i.e. early, speedily (comp. Psalm 46:5; Psalm 90:14). For in thee do I trust. His utter trust in God gives him a claim to be beard and helped. Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; i.e. illumine me, so that I may perceive the course which I ought to follow (comp. Psalm 5:8, \"Make thy way straight before my face\"). For I lift up my soul unto thee. Again, a sort of claim seems to be urged, as in clause 2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm143:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies (comp.

Psalm 25:4, 5; Psalm 139:24). For thou art my God. Therefore my Guide and Teacher. Thy spirit is good; i.e. gracious and merciful. Lead ms into the land of uprightness; rather, along a land of smoothness. Some critics unite the last two clauses, and translate, \"Let thy good Spirit lead me along a land of smoothness\" - \"conduct me,\" i.e. over smooth ground, where I need not stumble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm143:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTQuicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Name's sake; i.e. give me fresh spiritual life (setup.

To show how righteous thou art, i.e. how good and gracious.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm143:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies. In thy goodness towards me, remove those enemies whose conduct towards me has been described in vers. 3, 4. And destroy all them that afflict my soul. This is David's ordinary prayer with respect to his enemies, whom be counts as God's adversaries, and the persecutors of faithful Israel (see Psalm 5:10; Psalm 7:9; Psalm 10:15; Psalm 28:4, 5; Psalm 35:4-6, 8, etc.). For I am thy servant. Entitled, therefore, to thy special care and protection (comp.

The general resemblance to Psalm 18:2 is striking, but there are peculiar and original touches which indicate the author, not the copyist. For instance, the expression, \"my goodness,\" occurs nowhere else. Who subdueth my people under me. Another reading gives, \"Who subdueth peoples under me.\" Either reading suits the circumstances of David, who had to subdue a great portion of his own people under him (2 Samuel 2:8-31; 2 Samuel 3:6-21), and also conquered many foreign nations (2 Samuel 8:1-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Lord, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him!

And yet God has regard to this weak creature of an hour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down. The strain changes. From praise of God's loving-kindness and might, the psalmist proceeds to invoke his aid. Taking his metaphors from Psalm 18:9. \"Bow thy heavens, O Lord,\" he says, \"and come down\" to earth - appear in thy might, to the discomfiture of thy enemies and the relief of thy faithful ones. Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. Do as thou wert pleased to do at Sinai, when thou showedst thyself - \"Touch the mountains, and let a smoke go up from them\" (see Exodus 19:16, 18; Deuteronomy 4:11; Psalm 18:7-14) - a consuming fire, that shall burn up the ungodly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thins arrows, and destroy them (comp.

Rid me; rather, rescue me. And deliver me out of great waters. \"Great waters,\" or \"deep waters,\" is a common metaphor in the Psalms for serious peril. David's peril at this time was from the hand of strange children; literally, sons of strangers; i.e. foreign foes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Whose mouth speaketh vanity; rather, fraud (comp.

The right hand was lifted up in the taking of a solemn oath (see Ezekiel 20:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will sing a new song unto thee, O God. Another change of strain. The psalmist returns to his original theme of the praise of God (see vers. 1, 2), and promises a \"new song,\" as in Psalm 40:3. Upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee; rather, upon a psaltery of ten strings (see the Revised Version, and comp. Psalm 33:2). Assyrian harps had commonly, in the earlier ages, either eight, nine, or ten strings ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 530, 2nd edit.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - It is he that giveth salvation unto kings. There has always been a belief, especially in the East, that \"a divinity doth hedge a king.\" Saul himself was regarded by David as sacrosanct, and to kill him, even at his own request, was a sacrilege (2 Samuel 1:14-16). Who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. David speaks of himself by name, not only here, but in Psalm 18:50; 2 Samuel 7:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood (see above, vers. 7, 8). The passage is made a refrain, to terminate stanzas 2 and 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - That our sons may be as plants. The stanza which these words introduce is a very remarkable one, having nothing at all corresponding to it in the rest of the Psalter. It has been thought by some to be an antique document, quoted by the writer of the psalm, as suited for a festal occasion. Our translation makes it a picture of the condition to which the writer hopes that Israel may one day come; but the best recent critics see in it a description of Israel's actual condition in the writer's day. Professor Cheyne translates, \"Because our sons are as plants;\" and Dr. Kay, \"What time our sons are as plants.\" Grown up in their youth; literally, grown large. The sons are compared to ornamental trees or shrubs, growing outside a building. That our daughters may be as cornerstones, polished (or, \"carved\") after the similitude of a palace. The daughters are like carved pillars, lighting up the angular recesses of the structure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store; or, \"while our garners are full,\" etc. That our sheep may bring forth; rather, and our sheep bring forth. Thousands and tea thousands in our streets; rather, in our fields. Khutsoth (חוּצות) is rendered \"fields\" by our translators in Job 5:10 and Proverbs 8:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - That our oxen may be strong to labor; rather, and our oxen are heavily laden. A sign that an abundant harvest is being gathered in. That there be no breaking in, nor going out; literally, and there is no breach and no removal; i.e. no breach made in our walls, and no removal of our population into captivity. That there be no complaining in our streets; rather, and no wailing in our streets. Here the description of a happy time ends, and a burst of congratulation follows (see the next verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm144:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHappy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Happy is that people, that is in such a case! yea, happy is that people, whose God is the Lord!

Men will \"speak of the might of God's terrible acts,\" which are those that attract them most - the plagues wrought in Egypt, the overthrow of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea, the earth swallowing up Dathan, and the like.

And shall sing of thy righteousness; i.e. shall sing hymns of praise for thy righteous dealings with them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. Professor Cheyne compares the epithets in a Babylonian hymn to the sun-god; but a closer parallel is to be found in Exodus 34:6, 7, \"The Lord God is merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin\" (see also Psalm 86:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works. \"The Lord is good to all;\" he \"maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and send-eth rain on the just and on the unjust\" (Matthew 5:45). He \"wouldeth not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and live,\" And his \"tender mercies,\" or \"compassions,\" are not only over his human creatures, but\" over all his works\" - all that he has made - animals as well as men, \"creeping things,\" zoophytes, all that can feel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord (comp.

And thy saints shall bless thee; or, \"thy loving ones\" - those who are devoted to thy service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom (comp. Psalm 22:28; Psalm 45:6). The \"glory\" of God's kingdom is such that the faithful are naturally drawn to \"speak\" of it. \"His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion endureth throughout all ages\" (ver. 13). \"His kingdom ruleth over all\" (Psalm 103:19) - heaven and earth, and hell, and all space, and whatever space contains. There is no limit either to its extent or its duration. And its \"glory\" transcends all. human thought - much more all description. \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\" etc. And talk of thy power. \"Power\" is of the essence of kingship, and comes naturally to the front whenever the character of a kingdom is spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts. It is a part of the duty of \"saints\" (ver. 10) to make known as widely as possible - if possible, to all men - the \"mighty acts\" and glory of God; primarily, for God's glory; and secondarily, to bring about their conversion to God's service. And the glorious majesty of his kingdom (comp. vers. 5, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom (comp. Daniel 4:3, 34). It is inconceivable that God's kingdom should come to an end. He cannot will it to cease, and so dethrone himself. Much less can any other, and necessarily inferior, power overthrow it. And thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. This is rather an anti-climax, since the generations of men will one day cease; but it was a customary phrase (Psalm 33:11; Psalm 45:17; Psalm 49:11; Psalm 61:6; Psalm 62:5, etc.), and brought home to men the thought that his special \"dominion\" was over them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Lord upholdeth all that fall.

Psalm 146:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season (cf. Psalm 104:21, 27; Psalm 136:25; Psalm 147:9). The constant supply of all living creatures with their necessary food is little less than a standing miracle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.

Mercy and truth meet in God (Psalm 85:10). He is at once perfectly just, and absolutely tender and compassionate. \"All his works\" experience both his justice and his tenderness (comp. Psalm 25:8; Psalm 116:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him (comp. Deuteronomy 4:7; Psalm 34:18; Psalm 46:1; Psalm 119:151, etc.). God draws near to those who draw near to him; i.e. he makes his presence (which is always everywhere) felt by them. To all that call upon him in truth. A limiting clause. Mere formal prayer is useless, does not lessen the distance between God and man, rather augments it. If we really desire to enjoy the consciousness of his presence, we must call upon him \"in truth,\" i.e. sincerely, with earnest desire and strong confidence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him (comp. ver. 16). What he does for \"every living thing,\" he will do more especially for men, if they truly\" fear\" him, and love him (ver. 20), and draw near to him in sincerity and truth. He also will hear their cry, and will save them; i.e. deliver them out of their troubles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Lord preserveth all them that love him (comp. Psalm 31:23; Psalm 97:10). But all the wicked will he destroy. The \"severity\" of God is always set against his \"goodness\" in Holy Scripture, lest men should misunderstand, and think to obtain salvation though they continue in wickedness (see Exodus 34:6, 7; Romans 2:2-11; Romans 11:22, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm145:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord. The \"psalm of praise\" (title) ends as it began (vers. 1, 2) - with the strong determination of the psalmist that he at least will praise Jehovah. Others, he hopes, will join with him, and all flesh bless his holy Name (literally, the Name of his holiness) forever and ever; but for this result he can only wish and hope and pray - he cannot ensure it. But he can, and does, fulfill his own duty in the matter.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.146":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm146:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise ye the LORD.

Nearly identical with Psalm 104:35a. It is our duty towards God to be always praising him, if not with the lips, at any rate with the heart. I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. Identical with Psalm 104:33b.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm146:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPut not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Put not your trust in princes (comp. Psalm 118:10). Israel was always apt to trust in bureau rather than Divine help. Now it was Egypt (Isaiah 30:2; Isaiah 36:6), now Assyria (2 Kings 16:7), now their own kings or nobles. At the time of the return from the Captivity, too much was expected from Zerubbabel and the other \"princes.\" Nor in the son of man. The Prayer-book paraphrase, \"nor in any child of man,\" brings out the sense. Confidence in human aid of whatever kind is forbidden. In whom there is no help; or, \"that hath no saving power\" (שׁוּעה).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm146:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; or, \"when his breath goes forth\" - i.e., when he breathes his last - \"he returns to his earth,\" i.e. to the earth of which he was made (Genesis 2:7, 19). In that very day his thoughts perish. All his schemes and projects ('eshtonoth, a word not occurring elsewhere) come to an end - are nipped in the bud - perish.

It is rare in the historical books and in the prophets. Whose hope is in the Lord his God (comp.

Israel's history was an ample comment on this text. Which giveth food to the hungry (comp. Psalm 145:15, 16, and the comment ad loc.). The Lord looseth the prisoners. Either captive nations, as Israel; or individuals, as Jeremiah from his dungeon (Jeremiah 37:16, 17), Daniel from the lions' den (Daniel 6:23), Peter from his prison-house (Acts 12:7-10), and the like. Deliverance from the bands of sin may also be intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm146:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind (comp. Isaiah 35:5). The spiritually blind would seem to be meant, rather than the physically blind, since there is no record of any restoration of physical sight in the Old Testament. The Lord raiseth them that are bowed down (see Psalm 145:14). \"Bowed down,\" i.e., under the hand of oppressors. The Lord loveth the righteous. This lies at the root of all, and shows that the various deliverances spoken of in vers. 7-9 are to be understood as deliverances of the righteous out of their troubles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm146:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Lord preserveth the strangers. God's goodness leads him not only to protect the righteous, but also to lend his special help to the weak and afflicted classes. \"The stranger, the fatherless, and the widow\" are constantly mentioned in the Old Testament as peculiar objects of the Divine care (Exodus 22:21, 22; Leviticus 19:33, 34; Deuteronomy 10:18; Job 29:12; Psalm 82:3; Isaiah 1:28; Jeremiah 7:6, etc.). He relieveth the fatherless and widow; or, \"upholdeth\" (see the Revised Version). But the way of the wicked he turneth upside down (comp. Psalm 145:20). His merciful protection of his saints leads him to overthrow the goings of the wicked, who are their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm146:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord shall reign forever (comp. Psalm 10:16; Psalm 145:13). Even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. On the restoration of Israel to its own land, Jehovah becomes emphatically once more \"the God of Zion\" (see Zechariah 2:10; Zechariah 8:3). And this he remains \"to all generations,\" since the Church of Christ is now the true Zion (Hebrews 12:22).

The rebuilding of Jerusalem after the return from the Babylonish captivity covered a space of above ninety years, from B.C. 538 till B.C. 445. First the temple was built (B.C. 533-515); then the city; finally, the walls and the gates ( B.C. 445). It was in connection with this last portion of the building that the present psalm seems to have been written. He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. The exiles returned gradually - some with Zerubbabel ( B.C. 538); some with Ezra, in B.C. 457; others, doubtless, with Nehemiah, in B.C. 445; and again in B.C. 434.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He healeth the broken in heart (comp. Psalm 51:17; Isaiah 57:15). Israel in exile was broken-hearted, wretched, miserable (see Psalm 137:1-4; Isaiah 64:6 - 12). Their restoration to their own land \"healed\" them.

Nothing escapes God's knowledge. He knew the number of the exiles, and the place and name of each, just as he knows the number of the stars and their names (comp. Isaiah 40:26).

He is at once omnipotent and omniscient.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord lifteth up the meek (comp.

The glad sound of the harp should accompany his praises.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth. In the parched and sultry East \"clouds\" and \"rain\" are a boon that we of the temperate West can scarcely appreciate. The cruel heat of the solar rays in a clear sky for weeks or months together causes a longing of the intensest kind for shade and moisture. Man and beast alike rejoice when the time of the autumn rains draws near, and the cloudless blue of the summer heaven gives place (of a sky that is gray and overcast (comp. Job 38:25-41; Psalm 104:13). Who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains. The \"mountains,\" and even the plains of Palestine, are, with rare exceptions, completely burnt up at the close of summer, and show no verdure, but merely an arid sapless, brown or buff vegetation. When the\" former rain\" begins, a great change begins. Tender green blades of grass at once sprout up, and in a little time the whole country shows a tinge of verdure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He giveth to the beast his food (comp. Psalm 104:27; Psalm 145:15, 16). The constant supplies of their own proper food to all classes of animals are among the principal proofs of God's power and goodness. And to the young ravens which cry. Even the unclean raven, with his harsh croak and inelegant form, is not neglected (comp. Luke 12:24, \"God feedeth them\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He delighteth not in the strength of the horse. In a certain sense, God no doubt \"delights\" in the glory and excellency of all his creatures; but their physical endowments do not give him the sensible pleasure which he derives from the moral qualities of his rational creation (see ver. 11). The negation is not absolute, but relative (compare \"I will have mercy, and not sacrifice\"). He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man; i.e. in his strength and swiftness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him (comp.

In those that hope in his mercy; or, \"that wait for his loving-kindness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem. The other exhortations to praise in the psalm are general (vers. 1, 7); now a special call is made on Jerusalem to give him praise, since Jerusalem has lately experienced special mercies (vers. 13, 14). Praise thy God, O Zion (comp. Psalm 146:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates. The strength of gates in the ancient world depended wholly upon their bars, which were generally strong beams of wood passed across from side to side of the gateway, about midway up the gate, having their ends inserted into strong iron hooks or clamps, which were let into the stonework of the walls. The \"bars\" of the gates of Jerusalem are mentioned in Nehemiah repeatedly (Psalm 3:3, 6, 13, 14, 15; 7:3). He hath blessed thy children within thee. Under Nehemiah's govern-meet, when he had firmly established it, Israel enjoyed a period of repose and of great prosperity, which, at the date of the psalm, was probably just commencing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He maketh peace in thy borders. The completion of the walls and gates of Jerusalem brought to an end the troubles caused by Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem, and established general peace and tranquility in Israel. And filleth thee with the finest of the wheat; literally, with the fat of wheat; i.e. wheat in abundance and of good quality. The prosperity of Nehemiah's time appears in Nehemiah 10:28-39; Nehemiah 12:44-47; Nehemiah 13:12-15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth. Heavy crops, good harvests, abundant food, result from God's providential ordering of his world, to which he gives commands that are obeyed instantly, since his word runneth very swiftly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He giveth snow like wool. The loveliness of new-fallen snow has evidently been felt by the psalmist, to whom it has seemed like a spotless robe of whitest wool spread upon the earth. Snow, though rare in Palestine, does occasionally fall, and is said to \"cover the streets of Jerusalem two winters out of three. It generally comes in small quantities; but there are sometimes very snowy winters.\" In 1879, for instance, snow lay in Jerusalem to a depth of seventeen inches (Geikic, 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 2. p. 58). He scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. The metaphor is less appropriate, and was selected, probably, on account of the near resemblance of the two words, kephor and kaepher.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He casteth forth his ice like morsels; or, \"like crumbs;\" i.e. in profusion, as men feed birds. The \"ice\" intended would seem to be that of hailstones. Who can stand before his cold? Though the thermometer rarely shows more than six or seven degrees of frost in Palestine, yet the Oriental is as much chilled by such a temperature as the Englishman by one twenty degrees lower. He shivers in his light attire, and is very reluctant to leave the shelter of his house or tent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He sendeth out his word, and melteth them (comp. ver. 15). God has only to \"speak the word,\" and all trace of winter disappears - hoar-frost, hail, snow, melt away, and the atmosphere is once more soft and genial. He causeth his wind to blow. The change usually comes With a change of wind, which, as with ourselves, is commonly cold from the north and east, warm from the west and south. And the waters flow. A thaw sets in, and soon all the watercourses are full of rushing streams.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. Beyond and above all the physical blessings which God bestows on man are the gifts of spiritual enlightenment and direction. These also Israel may count on receiving from him, who has already given them a written revelation - \"statutes and judgments\" - while he also enlightens and directs them from time to time by his prophets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm147:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them.

Though the Word of God, to a certain extent, \"lighteth every man that cometh into the world\" (John 1:9), yet this light of nature is not to be compared to the revelation vouchsafed to Israel. Israel was God's \"peculiar people,\" and had peculiar privileges, which involved special responsibilities. And as for his judgments, they (i.e. the nations) have not known them (comp.

The praises of God must form their chief occupation through all eternity. Praise ye him, all his hosts; rather, all his host.

The clouds are probably intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Let them praise the Name of the Lord. Frequent changes of person, when no doubt can arise as to the meaning, are a sort of Hebrew idiom. They give liveliness and variety. For he commanded, and they were created (Genesis 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15, etc.). All creation sprang into being at the word of God (Psalm 33:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He hath also established them forever and ever (comp. Psalm 89:37). The expression, \"forever and ever,\" must not be pressed. It means \"for all time\" - while heaven and earth endure - but does not imply an absolute perpetuity. He hath made a decree which shall not pass; rather, which shall not pass away (see the Revised Version; and comp Genesis 8:22; Jeremiah 31:35, 36; Jeremiah 33:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Praise the Lord from the earth. The counterpart of the clause in ver. 1, \"Praise ye the Lord from the heavens.\" Earth must join with heaven in the praise of God. Ye dragons; or, \"ye sea-monsters\" (comp. Psalm 74:13, where the same word is used). Hengstenberg translates by \"whales;\" but all the greater sea-animals are probably included. And all deeps. The extreme \"ocean depths\" are meant - \"lower deeps,\" in certain parts of what was commonly known as \"the great deep\" (Psalm 36:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Fire and hail. By \"fire,\" in this combination, we must understand \"lightning,\" or rather the various electrical phenomena accompanying storms in the East, which are sometimes very strange and terrible. Snow and vapors; rather, vapor. The mist so often accompanying snowstorms is probably the \"vapor\" intended. Stormy wind fulfilling his word (comp. Psalm 107:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Mountains, and all hills. The later psalmists are great admirers of\" mountains.\" Perhaps the fiat and monotonous Babylonian plains led them to appreciate the beauties of a landscape like that of Palestine (comp. Psalm 83:14; Psalm 114:4, 6; Psalm 144:5; Psalm 147:8). Fruitful trees; rather, fruit trees; literally, trees of fruit. The Babylonian palms may have swept across the writer's remembrance; but probably the vine, the olive, and the fig, which were among the chief glories of Palestine, were in his mind principally. And all cedars. Babylonia had had no \"cedars.\" When the exiles returned, the beauty of the cedar broke upon them as a sort of new revelation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Beasts, and all cattle. There is a gradual ascent - from inanimate to animate things, from the \"beasts\" of the field to domesticated animals; from such animals to man (vers. 11, 12). Creeping things (comp. Genesis 1:24, 25, 30; Psalm 104:25). And flying fowl; literally, bird of wing. The intention is to include, under a few heads, all animate creation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Kings of the earth, and all people; rather, all peoples; or, all nations. Princes, and all judges of the earth. \"Kings,\" \"princes,\" and \"judges\" represent the upper classes of society; \"peoples,\" or \"nations,\" all the remainder. Together, they include the whole race of mankind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth young men, and maidens; old men, and children:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children.

The obligation to praise God lies upon all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Let them praise the Name of the Lord. This is the burden of the entire psalm (see especially ver. 5, and comp. vers. 1-4, 7, and 14). For his Name alone is excellent; or, \"exalted\" (comp. Psalm 8:1; Isaiah 12:4). The exaltation of God's Name is effected mainly by the praises which his rational creatures render to him. His glory is above the earth and heaven. (On God's \"glory,\" see Psalm 8:1; Psalm 19:1; Psalm 57:5, 11; Psalm 63:2; Psalm 89:17, etc.) \"Earth and heaven\" is an unusual phrase; the terms are commonly inverted. Here, perhaps, the order may be accounted for by the law of climax. \"His glory is not only above the earth, but even above the heavens.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm148:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.

On the contrary, it makes the union between himself and them closer. His might enables him to confer benefits on his people - to \"exalt their horn;\" i.e. to increase their glory and their strength, and set them up above their enemies. The praise of all his saints. The construction is doubtful. Some regard \"praise\" as in apposition with \"horn,\" and understand that God, by exalting the \"horn\" (power) of his saints, exalts also their \"praise\" or \"renown.\" Others imagine an ellipse, and translate, \"Praise belongs to all his saints\" (Kay); or, \"Seemly is praise for all his saints\" (Cheyne). Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. The \"children of Israel\" are nearer to God than others, since he has taken them to himself as his own peculiar people, and both \"draws nigh\" to them (Psalm 69:11), and draws them near to him (Jeremiah 30:21).

A \"new song\" on account of a new deliverance (comp. Psalm 33:3). The deliverance may have been one of those under Nehemiah (Nehemiah 4:7-23; Nehemiah 6:2-16).

Psalm 95:6). This ground of thankfulness Israel possesses in common with all the rest of mankind; but he has also another exclusive ground - let the children of Zion be joyful in their King (comp. Judges 8:23; 1 Samuel 8:7; 1 Samuel 10:19; 1 Samuel 12:12, etc.). God, by covenant with Israel, had constituted himself in an especial way their King (Hosea 13:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm149:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Let them praise his Name in the dance (comp.

Let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. (On the toph, or \"timbrel,\" see the comment upon Psalm 68:25). It was used to accompany a hymn of rejoicing by Miriam (Exodus 15:20), by Jephthah's daughter (Judges 11:34), and by David (2 Samuel 6:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm149:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people.

He will beautify the meek with salvation.

Therefore let God's saints at the present time - his restored people, who have just had a fresh deliverance - rejoice, in the \"glory\" that covers them - rejoice and give God thanks for it. Let them sing aloud upon their beds. Not, as in former days, weeping through the long night (Psalm 6:6; Psalm 77:2-6), and watering their couches with their tears, but, like Paul and Silas (Acts 16:25), singing hymns of praise to God \"at midnight\" as they rest upon their beds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm149:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let the high praises of God be in their mouth; literally, in their throat (comp. Isaiah 58:1). And a two-edged sword in their hand. Some understand this metaphorically. But the weapons of Jewish warfare in Nehemiah's time were thoroughly carnal (Nehemiah 4:13, 16, 17, 18); and against adversaries such as Sanbailat, Geshem, and Tobiah, a nation threatened with extermination is certainly entitled to use the sword.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm149:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - To execute vengeance upon the heathen. Not private revenge, but the just vengeance which a threatened nation has, from time to time, to execute on its persecutors in self-defense. And punishments upon the people; rather, upon the peoples. A variant of the phrase in the preceding clause, without any serious modification of the meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm149:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - To bind their kings with chains. Even royal captives were thus treated in the ancient world. Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs always represent their captives, even when kings, as fettered. Nebuchadnezzar \"bound Zedekiah with fetters of brass\" (2 Kings 25:7). Parthia, and later Persia, and even Rome, followed the same practice. And their nobles with fetters of iron. On the monuments, cap-fives below the rank of kings are not often seen \"fettered.\" Their arms, however, are frequently tied together with a cord, and they are fastened one to another by a stout rope.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm149:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints.

The allusion is probably to Deuteronomy 32:41, 42, where God announces the judgments that he will execute upon the oppressors of his people. This honor have all his saints; rather, a glory is this to all his saints. \"The victories of their Lord reflect glory on all his faithful and devoted servants\" (Kay.).

An atheism is here depicted which goes beyond even that of Psalm 10. There the existence of God was not so much denied as his providence. Here his existence is not only denied, but denied in the very depths of the man's heart. He has contrived to convince himself of what he so much wishes. The psalmist regards such a state of mind as indicative of that utter perversity and folly which is implied in the term nabal (נָבַל). They are corrupt; literally, they have corrupted themselves (comp. Gem 6:12; Judges 2:19). Their atheism is accompanied by deep moral corruption. We have no right to say that this is always so; but the tendency of atheism to relax moral restraints is indisputable. They have done abominable works (comp. vers. 3 and 4). There is none that doeth good; i.e. none among them. The psalmist does not intend his words to apply to the whole human race. He has in his mind a, \" righteous generation\" (ver. 5), \"God's people\" (ver. 4), whom he sets over against the wicked, both in this psalm and elsewhere universally (see Psalm 1:1-3; Psalm 2:12; Psalm 3:8; Psalm 4:3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2 - The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men. Corruption having reached such a height as it had, God, is represented as looking down from heaven with a special object - to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. To see, i.e., if among the crowd of the \"abominable\" doers spoken of in ver. 1 there were any of a better spirit, and possessed of understanding, and willing to seek after God. But it was in vain. The result of his scrutiny appears in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They are all gone aside. Haccol (הַכֹּל), \"the totality\" - one and all of them had turned aside, like the Israelites at Sinai (Exodus 32:8); they had quitted the way of righteousness, and turned to wicked courses. The expression \"denotes a general - all but universal-corruption\" ('Speaker's Commentary'). They are all together become filthy; literally, sour, rancid - like milk that has turned, or butter that has become bad. There is none that doeth good, no, not one. St. Paul's application of this passage (Romans 3:10-12), to prove that \"all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (ver. 23), goes beyond the intention of the psalmist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? The exclamation is put in the mouth of God. Can it be possible that none of these evil-doers is aware of the results of evil-doing? Do they think to escape Divine retribution? The \"wonder expresses the magnitude of their folly\" (Hengstenberg). Who eat up my people as they eat bread. Reducing men to poverty, robbing them, and devouring their substance, is called, in Scripture, devouring the men themselves (see Proverbs 30:14; Isaiah 3:14; Micah 3:3). Those who are plundered and despoiled are compared to \"bread\" in Numbers 14:2. The Homeric δημοβόρος βασιλεὺς, adduced by Dr. Kay, is an instance of the same metaphor. And call not upon the Lord. This might have seemed scarcely to need mention, since \"how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?\" (Romans 10:14). But it connects them definitely with the atheists of ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - There were they in great fear. \"There\" - in the midst of their evil-doing, while they are devouring God's people - a sudden terror seizes on them. Psalm 53:5 adds, \"Where no fear was,\" which seems to imply a panic terror, like that which seized the Syrians when they were besieging Samaria (2 Kings 7:6, 7). For God is in the generation of the righteous. God's people cannot be attacked without provoking him; they ere in him, and he in them; he will assuredly come to their relief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his Refuge. The sense is obscure. Some translate, \"Ye may shame the counsel of the poor (i.e. put it to shame, baffle it); but in vain; for the poor have a sure Refuge,\" and the ultimate triumph will belong to them. Others, \"Ye pour contempt on the poor man's counsel,\" or \"resolve,\" because \"the Lord is his Refuge;\" i.e. ye contemn it, and deride it, just because it rests wholly on a belief in God, which you regard as folly (see ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! The salvation of the \"righteous generation\" (ver. 5), the \"true Israel,\" is sure to come. Oh that it were come already! It will proceed \"out of Zion,\" since God's Name is set there. The ark of the covenant had been already set up in the place which it was thenceforth to occupy (see 2 Samuel 6:12-17). David's reign in Jerusalem is begun. When the Lord bringeth back the captivity of his people; either, when the Lord turneth the ill fortune of his people, or, when the Lord re-turneth to the captivity of his people; i.e. when he no longer turns away from their sufferings and afflictions, but turns towards them, and lifts up the light of his countenance upon them, then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

An upright walk is the first requisite (comp. Genesis 17:1; Psalm 26:3, 11; Isaiah 33:15). Such a walk involves the doing of righteousness, not, of course, in absolute perfection, but with a sincere intention, and so as to have \"the answer of a good conscience towards God\" (1 Peter 3:21). And speaketh the truth in his heart. Not \"from his heart,\" as in the Prayer-book Version, which would make the reference one to mere truth of speech, but \"in his heart,\" which points to internal truthfulness - that truthfulness \"in the hidden council-chamber of the soul,\" which \"holds no parley with what is false\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He that backbiteth not with his tongue. Among the negative virtues the first place is given to the observance of the ninth commandment, probably because to err in this respect is so very common a fault (see Jeremiah 6:28; Jeremiah 9:4; James 3:5-8). Nor doeth evil to his neighbour; rather, to his friend, or his companion - a different word from that used at the end of the verse, and implying greater intimacy. There is special wickedness in injuring one with whom we are intimate. Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. The good man does not, even when it is true, spread an ill report concerning his neighbour. He prefers to keep silence, and let the report die out (see Exodus 33:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD.

Others prefer to translate, \"He is despised in his own eyes, [and] worthless\" (Abort Ezra, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Either rendering furnishes a good sense; but the law of parallelism is very decidedly in favour of the former. As the righteous man honors those who fear God, so he contemns those who are vile or worthless. He is no respecter of persons. Men's outward circumstances are nothing to him. He awards honour or contempt according to men's moral qualities. But he honoreth them that fear the Lord. \"It is no common virtue,\" says Calvin, \"to honour pious and godly men, since in the opinion of the world they are often as the offscouring of all things (1 Corinthans 4:13)? He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. The righteous man, if he happens to have sworn to do something which it turns out will be to his own hurt, nevertheless keeps his engagement (comp Leviticus 5:4, where לְהָרַע is used in the same sense).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent.

Usury, when one Israelite borrowed of another, was strictly forbidden by the Law (Exodus 22:25; Leviticus 25:36; Deuteronomy 23:19). When the borrower was a foreigner, it was lawful (Deuteronomy 15:3; Deuteronomy 33:20); and no discredit can attach to the practice, so long as the rate of interest charged is moderate (comp. Matthew 25:27). Here the writer contemplates only such usury as was forbidden by the Law. Nor taketh reward against the innocent; refuses, i.e., to take a bribe, either as judge or witness, when a charge is made against an innocent person. The contrary conduct was widely practised by the Israelites in later times (see Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 5:23; Jeremiah 22:17; Ezekiel 22:12; Hoe. 4:18; Micah 3:11, etc.), and prevails generally in the East to the present day.

But if we read אמרתי with a large number of manuscripts, with the LXX., the Vulgate, the Syriac, and most other versions, no insertion will be necessary. The meaning will then be, I have said to Jehovah. Thou art my Lord; Hebrew, adonai - \"my Lord and Master.\" My goodness extendeth not to thee. This meaning cannot be elicited from the Hebrew words. Tobah is not \"goodness,\" but \"prosperity\" or \"happiness\" (comp. Psalm 106:5); and 'aleyka is best explained as \"beside thee,\" \"beyond thee.\" The psalmist means to say that he has no happiness beside (or apart from) God. (So Ewald, Hengstenberg, Cheyne, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But to the saints that are in the earth; rather, it is for the saints. It (i.e. my prosperity) is granted me for the advantage of the saints that are in the land; i.e. of all the true Israelites. \"I hold it in trust for them\" (Kay). And to (rather, for) the excellent, in whom is all my delight. And, especially, I hold it in trust for \"the inner circle of the excellent ones,\" in whom God takes pleasure (Psalm 147:11), and in whom therefore I also \"delight.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god. This is the only note of sadness in the entire psalm, and it is inserted to add force by contrast to the joyous outburst in ver. 5. If men would not cleave to Jehovah, but would \"hasten after\" - or perhaps it should be translated \"wed themselves to\" - another god (see Exodus 2:16, the only other place where the word occurs), then they must not expect \"prosperity,\" or joy of any kind. Their \"sorrows will be multiplied;\" distress and anguish will come upon them (Proverbs 1:27); they will have to pay dear for their apostasy. Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer. Drink offerings of actual blood are not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and there is very little evidence of their having been offered by any of the heathen nations, though it is conjectured that they may have been employed in the worship of Moloch. It is therefore best to explain the expression, as here used, metaphorically, as drink offerings as hateful as if they had been of blood (comp. Isaiah 66:3). Nor take up their names into my lips. By \"their names\" we must understand the names which they used - those by which they called their gods. The Law forbade the mention of these names by Israelites (Exodus 23:13; Deuteronomy 12:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The Lord is the Portion of mine inheritance. God had said to Aaron, when he gave him no special inheritance in Canaan, \"I am thy Part and thine Inherit-ante among the children of Israel\" (Numbers 18:20). David claims the same privilege. God is his \"Portion,\" and he needs no other. And of my cup. A man's \"cup\" is, in Scripture, his lot or condition in life (Psalm 11:6; Psalm 23:5) - that which is given him to drink. David will have God only for his cup. Thou maintainest my lot; i.e. thou makest it firm and sure (comp. Psalm 30:6, \"In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places. The \"lines\" which marked out the place of his abode (comp. Deuteronomy 32:9; Joshua 17:5). These had fallen to him \"in pleasant places\" - in Jerusalem and its near vicinity. Yea, I have a goodly heritage. Some explain \"heritage\" here by the \"inheritance\" of ver. 5. But the word used is different; and it is most natural to understand David's earthly heritage, or lot in life. This, he says, is \"pleasing\" or \"delightsome\" to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will bless the Lord, who hath given his counsel. God has become David's \"Counsellor\" (see Psalm 32:8), makes suggestions to him which he follows, and so guides his life that he feels bound to praise and bless him for it. My reins also instruct me in the night seasons. The reins, according to Hebrew ideas, are the seat of feeling and emotion. David is \"instructed\" or \"stimulated\" (Hengstenberg) to bless God by the feelings which stir within him as he lies awake at night - feelings, we must suppose, of affection and gratitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I have set the Lord always before me. I have brought myself, that is, to realize the continual presence of God, alike in happiness and in trouble. I feel him to be ever with me. Because he is at my right hand (i.e. close to me, ready to protect and save), therefore I shall not be moved. Nothing will shake me or disturb me from my trust and confidence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth. The thought of God's continual presence at his right hand causes David's \"heart\" to be \"glad,\" and his \"glory\" - i.e. his soul, or spirit (Genesis 49:6), man's true glory - to rejoice. My flesh also shall rest in hope. His \"flesh\" - his corporeal nature, united closely with his \"heart\" and \"spirit\" - rests, and will rest, secure, confident that God will watch over it, and make the whole complex man - body, soul, and spirit - to \"dwell in safety\" (Psalm 4:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; literally, to Sheol, or \"to Hades.\" The confidence in a future life shown here is beyond that exhibited by Job. Job hopes that he may not always remain in Hades, but may one day experience a \"change\" or \"renewal\" (Job 14:14); David is certain that his soul will not be left in hell. Hell (Sheol) is to him an \"intermediate state,\" through which a man passes between his life in this world and his final condition in some blest abode. Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. The present Hebrew text has חסידיך, \"thy holy ones,\" i.e. thy saints generally; but the majority, of the manuscripts, all the ancient versions, and even the Hebrew revised text (the Keri) have the word in the singular number, thus agreeing with Acts 2:27, 31; Acts 13:35, which give us the translation, τὸν ὄσιον σου, and declare the psalmist to have spoken determinately of Christ. Certainly he would not have spoken of himself as \"God's holy one.\" The translation of shachath (שָׁחַת) by \"corruption\" has been questioned, and it has been rendered \"the pit,\" or \"the grave,\" but quite gratuitously. The LXX. have διαφθορὰν as the equivalent; and the rabbinical commentators, giving it the same meaning, but expounding it of David, invented the myth that David's body was miraculously preserved from corruption.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou wilt show me the path of life; i.e. the path which leads to the Source and Centre of all life, even God himself - the way to heaven, in contrast with corruption and Sheol. In thy presence is fulness of joy; literally, satiety of joy - enough, and more than enough, to satisfy the extremest cravings of the human heart. At thy right hand; rather, in thy right hand - ready for bestowal on thy saints. Are pleasures for evermore. An inexhaustible store, which may be drawn upon for ever.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Hear the right, O Lord (comp. Psalm 9:4). Here and elsewhere the psalmist assumes that right is on his side, and that he is persecuted unjustly. Unless he had been convinced of this, he could not have called on God to vindicate him. The narrative in 1 Samuel 18. - 27, fully justifies his conviction. Attend unto my cry (comp. Psalm 4:1; Psalm 5:2; Psalm 61:1). Rinnah, the word translated \"cry\" here (and in Psalm 61:1) is a strong term: it means \"shout,\" \"outcry\" - most often, though not here, \"a shout of joy.\" Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips; rather, feigning lips, or guileful lips - lips, i.e., that speak falsehood knowingly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Let my sentence come forth from thy presence. David does not doubt, any more than Job (Job 13:18), what the sentence will be. As right is on his side (ver. 1), it must be in his favour. Let thine eyes behold the things that are equal; literally, Let thine eyes behold equities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou hast proved mine heart (comp. Psalm 26:2; Psalm 66:9; Psalm 95:9; Psalm 139:23). \"Proved\" means \"tried,\" \"tested,\" examined strictly, so as to know whether there was any wickedness in it or not. Thou hast visited me in the night. The night is the time when men can least escape those searching, testing thoughts which God's providence then especially sends, to \"try the very heart and reins\" (Psalm 7:9). Thou hast tried me., and shalt find nothing; rather, and findest nothing. The process was one begun in the past, and continuing on in the present. God was ever searching David and trying him; but \"found nothing,\" i.e. no alloy, no base rectal, no serious flaw in his character; not that he was sinless, but that he 'was sincere and earnest - a true worshipper of God, not a hypocrite. I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. \"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man\" (James 3:2). David's resolution to \"keep the door of his lips\" would have a chastening influence over both his thoughts and acts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConcerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Concerning the works of man; i.e. \"with respect to the actions of ordinary life \" - here called \"the works of Adam\" ? i.e. of the natural man. By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. By attending to thy Law, and following it (see Psalm 119:11), I have refrained myself from sin, and avoided the wicked courses of the violent (comp. 1 Samuel 24:4-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Hold thou up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. So De Wette and Rosenmuller; but most recent critics prefer to consider the words as an assertion rather than a prayer, and translate, \"My steps have held fast to thy paths: [therefore] my feet have not been moved\" (Kay, Hengstenberg, Alexander, Cheyne, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God (comp. vers. 1, 2). Having established, as the ground of his claim to be heard of God, his own sincerity, steadfastness, and virtuous course in life (vers. 3-5), David now recurs to his original intent, and resumes his \"prayer.\" He is sure that God will hear him, since his prayer is grounded on \"right.\" Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech (comp. Psalm 71:2; Psalm 88:2, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Show thy marvellous loving kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. It is uncertain to which clause of the sentence the word בִּימִיגָך belongs. Its position seems to attach it rather to those who resist God than to those who trust in him. See the marginal version, which has, O thou that savest them which trust in thee from those that rise up against thy right hand. But the rendering in the text of the Authorized Version is preferred by most writers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Keep me as the apple of the eye (comp. Deuteronomy 32. ]0, where the same simile is used). Here, however, the expression employed is still more tender and more practical: \"Keep me,\" says David,\" as the apple, daughter of the eye.\" Hide me under the shadow of thy wings. This seems also to be a reminiscence of Deuteronomy, where, after the mention of the \"apple of the eye,\" the water continues, As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: so the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him\" (Deuteronomy 32:11, 12; comp. further Psalm 36:7; Psalm 57:1; Psalm 63:8; Psalm 91:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - From the wicked that oppress me; or, lay me waste - treat me as invaders treat an enemy's territory (see Isaiah 15:1). From my deadly enemies, who compass me about; literally, my enemies in soul - those who in heart and mind are wholly set against me. When hunted by Saul upon the mountains, David was often \"compassed about\" with foes (1 Samuel 23:14, 15, 26; 1 Samuel 26:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They are enclosed in their own fat (comp.

So their feelings cannot work as nature intended through the coarseness and hardness in which they are, as it were, embedded. With their mouth they speak proudly (comp. Psalm 12:3, 4; Psalm 86:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They have now compassed us in our steps; rather, [following] our steps, they now compass me (comp. ver. 9; and see 1 Samuel 23:26). They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; rather, they have set their eyes, to east [me] down to the earth. The simile of the lion is already in the writer's mind. As the lion, before making his spring, fixes his eyes intently upon the prey - not to fascinate it, but to make sure of his distance - with intent, when he springs, to cast the prey down to the earth; so it is now with my enemies, who have set their eyes on me. (So Dr. Kay, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLike as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey; literally, his likeness [is] as a lion that is greedy to rend (comp. Psalm 7:2; Psalm 10:9; Psalm 57:4). And as it were a young lion (kephir, \"a lion in the first burst of youthful vigour\") lurking in secret places; rather, crouching. The attitude of the lieu when he is just preparing to spring.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Arise, O Lord (comp. Psalm 7:6; Psalm 9:19; Psalm 10:12; Psalm 44:26, etc.). Having described the character of the wicked man, and pointed out his ill desert (vers. 9-12), the psalmist now invokes God's vengeance upon him. \"Right\" requires equally the succour of the godly and the punishment of the ungodly man. Disappoint him, cast him down; literally, get before him, bow him down; i.e. intercept his spring, and bow him down to the earth (see Psalm 18:39). Deliver my soul from the wicked. This will be the result of the interposition. When the ungodly are cast down, the righteous are delivered out of their hand. Which is thy sword. 4. true statement (see Isaiah 10:5), but scarcely what the writer intended in this place, where he is regarding the wicked as altogether opposed to God. It is best to translate, with the Revised Version, Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - From men which are thy hand, O Lord; rather, from men, by thy hand, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, and in the text of the Revised Version. From men of the world; i.e. men who are altogether worldly, whose views, aspirations, hopes, longings, are bounded by this life - the \"children of this world,\" as our Lord expressed it (Luke 16:8). Which have their portion in this life; i.e. who have here all that they will ever receive, and all that they care to receive. And whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure; rather, with thy stores - the good things that thou makest the earth to produce. There seems to be some allusion here to the frequent worldly prosperity of the ungodly (comp. Job 12:6; Job 21:7-13; Psalm 73:3-12). They are full of children (so Job 21:8, 11; Job 27:14). And leave the rest of their substance to their babes (comp. Psalm 49:10). No doubt this is often the case; but the ill-gotten gains handed on by the wicked to their children seldom prosper (see Job 27:14-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; i.e. \"As for me, I do not envy the wicked man's prosperity. I set against it the blessedness of which I am quite sure. I in my righteousness shall behold the face of God, have the light of his countenance shine upon me, and thus be raised to a condition of perfect happiness.\" Moreover, I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness. David had already spoken of death as a \"sleep\" (Psalm 13:3). Now he speaks of \"awaking.\" What awaking can this be but an awaking from the sleep of death? When he so awakes, he says, he will he \"satisfied with God's likeness.\" The word used is the same as that employed in Numbers 12:8, of the manifestation of the Divine glory to Moses - viz. temunah. David therefore expects to see, on awaking, a similar manifestation, he will have the enjoyment of the \"beatific vision,\" if not in the Christian sense, at any rate in a true and real sense, and one that will wholly \"satisfy\" him.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I will love thee, O Lord, my Strength. This opening is very remarkable. The verb translated \"I will love\" expresses the very tenderest affection, and is elsewhere never used to denote the love of man towards God, but only that of God towards man. The entire verse, moreover, is withdrawn from the \"second edition\" of the psalm (2 Samuel 22.) - which was perhaps prepared for liturgical use - as too sacred and too private to suit a public occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord is my Rock; or, my Cliff - my Sela - an expression used commonly of Petra. And my Fortress (comp. Psalm 144:2). Not only a natural stronghold, but one made additionally strong by art. And my Deliverer. A living Protector, not a mere inanimate defence. My God, my Strength; rather, my Rock, as the same word (tsur) is translated in Exodus 17:6; Exodus 33:21, 22; Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 31; 1 Samuel 2:2; 2 Samuel 23:3; Isaiah 26:4. It is the word from which the strong city, Tyro, derived its. name. In whom I will trust (comp. Dent. 32:37). My Buckler (comp. Genesis 15:1, where God announced himself as Abraham's \"Shield;\" and see also Deuteronomy 33:29; Psalm 3:2; Psalm 5:12; Psalm 84:11; Psalm 119:114; Psalm 144:2). The Horn also of my salvation (comp. Luke 1:69). The horn is the emblem at once of strength and of dignity. A \"horn of salvation\" is a source of excellency and might, whence \"salvation\" or deliverance comes to those who trust in it. And my high Tower (comp. Psalm 9:9, with the comment ad loc.). It is remarked that God, in this passage, receives seven epithets, \"the mystic number which in sacred things symbolizes perfection\" (Delitzsch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised.

Here begins the narrative of David's sufferings in the past. \"'The sorrows' - or rather, 'the cords' - of death,\" he says, \"encompassed me,\" or \"coiled around me\" (Kay). Death is represented as a hunter, who goes out with nets and cords, encompassing his victims and driving them into the toils. David's recollection is probably of the time when he was \"hunted upon the mountains\" by Saul (1 Samuel 26:20), and expected continually to be caught and put to death (1 Samuel 19:1; 1 Samuel 23:15; 1 Samuel 27:1). And the floods of ungodlymen made me afraid; literally, the torrents of Belial, or of ungodliness. The LXX. have χείμαῥῤοι, ἀνομίας. Streams of ungodly men, the myrmidons of Saul, cut him off from escape.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The sorrows of hell compassed me about; literally, the cords of Sheol, or Hades. Death and Hell are, both of them, personified, and made to join in the chase. The ensnaring nets are drawn nearer and nearer; at last the toils close in, the last cast is made, and the prey is taken. The snares of death prevented me; or, came upon me (Revised Version) - \"took me by surprise\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God. At this supreme moment, when he is entangled in the snares, and on the point of being slain, the psalmist represents himself as invoking the aid of the Almighty. As HengstenBerg notes, \"While the manifold distresses are united in the beginning of the verse into one great 'distress,' so the manifold Divine hearings and helps are united into a single grand hearing and help\" - and, we may add, the manifold cries into one great cry. He heard my voice out of his temple; i.e. his tabernacle, since the temple was not yet built (comp. Psalm 5:7; Psalm 11:4); or perhaps, \"out of heaven \"(Cheyne). And my cry came before him, even into his ears (comp. Exodus 2:23, where the same word is used for the \"cry\" of the children of Israel in Egypt).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Then the earth shook and trembled; or, quailed and quaked (Kay, who thus expresses the assonance of the Hebrew vat-tig'ash vat-tir ash). The psalmist must not be understood literally. He does not mean that the deliverance came by earthquake, storm, and thunder, but describes the discomfiture and dismay of his opponents by a series of highly poetical images. In these he, no doubt, follows nature closely, and probably describes what he had seen, heard, and felt. The foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken. In violent earthquakes, the earth seems to rock to its foundations; mountain ranges are sometimes actually elevated to a height of several feet; rocks topple down; and occasionally there are earth-slips of enormous dimensions. Because he was wroth. God's anger against the psalmist's enemies produced the entire disturbance which he is describing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - There went up a smoke out of his nostrils. Emissions of smoke are a common feature of volcanic disturbances, with which earthquakes are closely connected. The LXX. give, instead of \"out of his nostrils,\" in his anger (ἐν ὀργῇ αὐτοῦ), which is better, since the Hebrew prefix בּ, \"in,\" certainly cannot mean \"out of.\" And fire out of his mouth devoured. Fire-balls are said to have accompanied some earthquakes, as especially that one by which Julian's design of rebuilding Jerusalem was frustrated. Coals were kindled by it. The fire-balls above spoken of are declared to have scorched and burnt the workmen employed by Julian (Amm. Marc., 23. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He bowed the heavens also, and came down (comp. Psalm 145:5). In a storm the clouds do actually descend, and the whole heaven seems to be bowed down to earth. God is said to \"come down\" to earth whenever he delivers the oppressed, and takes vengeance on their oppressors (see Exodus 3:8; 2 Samuel 22:10; Psalm 144:5; Isaiah 64. I, 3, etc.). And darkness was under his feet. A deep darkness commonly accompanies both earthquake and storm. When God actually descended on Mount Sinai, it was amid thunders and lightnings, and \"a thick cloud\" (Exodus 19:16), elsewhere called \"thick darkness\" (Deuteronomy 5:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly. The imagery here transcends all experience, and scarcely admits of comment or explanation. God is represented as borne through the heavens, as he proceeds to execute his purposes, by the highest of his creatures, the cherubim. Elsewhere (Psalm 104:3) he sails through the sky supported on clouds. Yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind; rather, he sped swiftly (Kay). The verb used is different from that translated \"did fly\" in the preceding verse. It is applied elsewhere especially to the eagle (Deuteronomy 28:49; Jeremiah 48:40; Jeremiah 49:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He made darkness his secret place; i.e. he hid himself amid clouds and thick darkness. In executing his judgments he did not allow himself to be seen. God's action is always secret and inscrutable. His pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. The original runs as follows: \"He made darkness his secret place - his pavilion round about him - dark waters, thick clouds of the skies.\" The whole forms one sentence, \"his pavilion\" being in apposition with \"secret place,\" and the last clause, \"dark waters, thick clouds of the skies,\" being exegetical of the \"darkness\" in the first clause. God's \"pavilion,\" or \"tent\" (סבּה), is mentioned again in Psalm 27:5 and Psalm 31:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed. The \"brightness\" intended is probably that of lightning. The \"thick clouds\" are riven and parted asunder for the lightning to burst forth. Then come, almost simultaneously, hail stones and coals of fire; i.e., hail like that which fell in Egypt before the Exodus (Exodus 9:22-34), when \"there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail\" (ver. 24) - a fire which \"ran along upon the ground,\" or some very unusual electrical phenomenon (see the comment on Exodus in the ' Homiletic Commentary,' p. 208).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice. With the lightning came, necessarily, thunder, rolling along the heavens, and seeming like the voice of God (comp. Job 38:4, 5). Hail stones and coals of fire. The phrase is repeated for the sake of emphasis. The hail and the lightning are represented as conjointly the ministers of the Divine vengeance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them. God's \"arrows\" are often spoken cf. Job felt them within him (Job 6:4). David has already said of them, that they are \"ordained against the persecutors\" (Psalm 7:13). We may understand by the expression any sharp pains, mental or bodily, which God sends. And he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. The effect of the tempest of God's wrath is to \"scatter\" and \"discomfit\" the enemy (comp. Exodus 14:24). Instead of\" and he shot out lightnings,\" our Revisers give, and lightnings manifold, which is perhaps better.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Then the channels of waters were seen. By \"the channels of waters\" seem to be meant the torrent-courses, so common in Palestine, especially on either side of Jordan, which convey into it the winter rains. These \"were seen,\" lit up by the \"lightnings manifold,\" having previously been in darkness (see vers. 9-11). At the same time, the foundations of the world were discovered. The earthquake (ver. 7) still continuing, the earth gaped in places, and the glare of the lightning enabled the eye to penetrate deep into the solid globe - so deep that it seemed to reach the \"foundations.\" At thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils (comp. ver. 7, \"because he was wroth\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. While destruction thus came upon David's enemies (vers. 12-14), God's protecting hand was stretched out to save David himself, who was carefully \"taken\" and tenderly \"drawn\" forth from among the \"many waters,\" i.e. the dangers and difficulties which threatened him. Some commentators see in the words used - \"he sent, he took me, he drew me\" - a tacit reference to Exodus 2:5, 10, and, by implication, a sort of parallel between the deliverance of David from his foes and that of Moses from the waters of the Nile (Kay, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He delivered me from my strong enemy. This is generally understood of Saul. By the defeat of Gilboa, and its consequences (1 Samuel 31:1-4), God delivered David from the peril of death which hung over him so long as Saul lived. And from them which hated me. David's enemies among the courtiers of Saul were powerless without their master. Many, probably, fell in the battle; the rest sank into obscurity. For they were too strong for me. I must have succumbed to them had not God helped me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They prevented me in the day of my calamity (comp. 1 Samuel 23:13-15; 1 Samuel 24:1-3; 1 Samuel 26:1-4, etc.). But the Lord was my Stay. God frustrated all the designs of David's foes, and prevented him from falling into their hands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He brought me forth also into a large place (comp. Psalm 31:8; Psalm 118:5). By \"a large place\" is probably meant open ground, not encompassed by snares, or nets, or enemies in ambush. He delivered me, because he delighted in me. David now proceeds to explain the grounds of God's favour towards him. He begins by summing up all in a word, \"God delighted in him.\" He then goes on to explain the causes of God's \"delight\" (vers. 20-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness. David has spoken of his \"righteousness\" already in Psalm 7:8. We must not suppose him to mean absolute blamelessness, any more than Job means such blamelessness by his \"integrity\" (Job 27:5; Job 31:6). He means honesty of purpose, the sincere endeavour to do right, such conduct as brings about \"the answer of a good conscience before God\" (1 Peter 3:21). According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me (comp. Job 27:9; Psalm 24:4). \"Clean hands\" are hands unstained by any wicked action.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For I have kept the ways of the Lord. Compare the statement of the young man whom Jesus \"looked upon and loved' (Mark 10:21), \"All these commandments have I observed from my youth\" (ver. 20). And have not wickedly departed from my God. It is observed that the word translated by \"departed wickedly\" implies \"wilful and persistent wickedness\" ('Speaker's Commentary') - \"an entire alienation from God\" (Calvin). Not even in the humblest of the penitential psalms, when David is bewailing his great offence, does he use this verb of himself. He is an example to all men not to indulge in a false humility, nor employ phrases concerning himself which go beyond the truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For all his judgments were before me; i.e. \"all his commandments\" (compare the use of the same word (מִשׁפַט throughout the hundred and nineteenth psalm). And I did not put away his statutes from me. The wicked are said to \"cast God's commandments behind their back\" (1 Kings 14:9; Nehemiah 9:26; Psalm 50:17; Ezekiel 23:35). David declares that he had never so acted; he had kept God's statutes always well before him, had borne them in mind, and given heed to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I was also upright before him (compare what is said of David in 1 Kings 11:4; 1 Kings 14:8; 1 Kings 15:5). Like Job, he was \"perfect and upright \" - \" one that feared God, and eschewed evil\" (Job 1:1). And I kept myself from mine iniquity; i.e. from the sin to which I was especially tempted.\" (Kay compares the αὐπερίστατος ἁμαρτία of Hebrews 12:1.) But what sin this was, we have no means of determining. All that appears is that David had an inclination to some particular form of sin, against which he found it necessary to be continually upon his guard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. Having set forth the particulars of his righteousness (vers. 21-23), the psalmist returns to his previous general statement (ver. 20), and emphatically reaffirms it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-28. - A short didactic digression is here interposed, extending the principles on which God has dealt with David and his enemies, to mankind generally (vers. 25-27); after which a return is made to Go&'s special dealings with David (ver. 28). Verse 25. - With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful. The main principle is that God will act towards men as they act towards him. If they are kindly, gracious, loving towards him - for this is what the word chasid means - he will be kindly, gracious, loving towards them, and vice versa, as explained in vers. 26, 27. With an upright man thou wilt show thyself upright; or, a perfect man (Revised Version). The word is the same as that used in Psalm 4:3; Psalm 12:1; Psalm 31:23; Psalm 34:6; Psalm 37:28, etc., and generally translated \"godly,\" or, in the plural, \"saints.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt show thyself froward; rather, thou wilt show thyself adverse. The same root is not here used for the verb as for the adjective, as is done in the three preceding clauses. The reason is well explained in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' \"In dealing with the good, God shows his approval by manifesting attributes similar or identical in essence; in dealing with the wicked, he exhibits attributes which are correlative - in just proportion to their acts,\" but not identical. God cannot \"show himself froward\" - he can only show himself opposed, antagonistic, an adversary. What the psalmist means to say is that, if men oppose and thwart God, he in return will oppose and thwart them. But they will act in a perverse spirit, he in a spirit of justice and righteousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - For thou wilt save the afflicted people; i.e. the oppressed and down-trodden, who are assumed to be pious and God-fearing (comp. Psalm 10:12-14; Psalm 11:2, etc.). But wilt bring down high looks (comp. Psalm 101:5 and Proverbs 6:17). The fact of \"pride going before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall,\" was noticed by the heathen of the ancient world, no less than by the\" peculiar people.\" And both alike attributed the downfall of the proud to God. \"Seest thou,\" says Herodotus, \"how God with his lightning smites always the bigger animals, and will not suffer them to wax insolent, while those of a lesser bulk chafe him not? How likewise his bolts ever fall on the highest houses and the tallest trees? So plainly does he love to bring down everything that exalts itself. Thus ofttimes a mighty host is discomfited by a few men, when God in his jealousy sends panic or storm from heaven, and they perish in a way unworthy of them. For God allows no one to have high thoughts but himself\" (vii. 10, § 5). But the heathen seem to have imagined that God envied the proud ones, and therefore cast them down.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-45. - As in the former narrative section (vers. 4-24) David seems to have had his earlier troubles in mind, so, in the present one, his troubles since he entered upon the kingdom seem especially to engage his thoughts. These consisted chiefly of wars with foreign enemies, in which, while he incurred many dangers, he was, upon the whole, eminently successful. Verse 28. - For thou wilt light my candle; rather, my lamp - the word generally used of the lamps supported by the seven-branched candelabrum of the tabernacle (see Exodus 25:37; Exodus 37:22, 23; Exodus 40:25). David himself is called \"the lamp of Israel\" in 2 Samuel 21:17. The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. The true lamp of David, which \"enlightened his darkness,\" was \"the light of God's countenance.\" While this shone upon him, his whole path was bright, and he himself, reflecting the Divine rays, was a lamp to others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - For by thee I have run through a troop. The military key-note is at once struck. Gedud (גְּדוּד) is a marauding band of light-armed troops sent out to plunder an enemy's country. David \"ran through\" such a \"troop,\" when he pursued and defeated the Amalekites who had plundered and burnt Ziklag (1 Samuel 30:17). It is called three times a gedud (vers. 8 and 15 twice). And by my God have I leaped over a wall. Shur (שׁוּר) is a rare word for \"wall,\" occurring in the Hebrew text only here and in Genesis 49:22, though used also of the walls of Jerusalem in the Chaldee of Ezra (Ezra 4:12, 13, 16). It may designate the walls of Jerusalem in this place, and David may intend to allude to his conquest of the stronghold of Zion from the Jebusites (2 Samuel 5:6, 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - As for God, his way is perfect (comp. Deuteronomy 32:4, \"His work is perfect, for all his ways are judgment\"). What God does, he does effectually; he does not have recourse to half-measures. The word of the Lord is tried; i.e. the promises of God are sure, they have been tested, and tried as by fire, and will never fail. He is a Buckler to all those that trust in him (comp. ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For who is God save the Lord (see Exodus 20:3; Deuteronomy 32:39). As the one and only God, absolute confidence may be placed in Jehovah, who is able to protect and preserve to the uttermost all who serve him (comp. 2 Samuel 7:22-29). Or who is a Rock save our God? (comp. ver. 2; and see also Deuteronomy 32:4, 18, 30, 31; and Psalm 61:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - It is God that girdeth me with strength (comp. ver. 39). And maketh my way perfect. Keeps me, i.e., in the right way - the way of his commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - He maketh my feet like hinds' feet (comp. 2 Samuel 2:18; 1 Chronicles 12:8; Habakkuk 3:19). The Israelites reckoned swiftness of foot, agility, and endurance among the highest of warlike qualities. These qualities were needed especially in the pursuit of defeated enemies; and the rapidity of David's conquests (2 Samuel 5:6-10; 2 Samuel 8:1-14; 2 Samuel 10:15-20) must be ascribed to them mainly. And setteth me upon my high places; i.e. establishes me in the strongholds that command my extensive territory, and give me secure possession of it, as Zion, Rabbath-Ammon, Damascus, Petra, perhaps Zobah, Rehob, and others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms (comp. Psalm 144:1). \"A bow of steel\" is a mistranslation, since nechusha (נְחוּשָׁה) is not \"steel,\" but \"brass,\" or rather \"bronze \"-and bows of steel were unknown to the ancients. Compare the comment on Job 20:24 ('Homiletic Commentary,' p. 352).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation; i.e. in battle thou extendest over me the shield of thy protection. Nothing was more common in ancient warfare than for a warrior, while he was engaged in using his offensive weapons, especially the bow, to be protected from the missiles of the enemy by a comrade who held a shield before him. The Assyrian kings were constantly thus defended in battle, and it was even common for an ordinary archer to be similarly guarded (see ' Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 30, 32, 33, for illustrations). And thy right hand hath holden me up. The \"right hand\" is always spoken of as the arm of greatest strength (comp. Psalm 44:3; Psalm 45:4; Psalm 48:10; Psalm 60:5, etc.). And thy gentleness hath made me great; rather, thy condescension (Kay) - the quality in God which most nearly corresponds to humility in man. The word is not elsewhere used of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. Job often complained that God \"hedged in his steps\" (Job 3:23) and \"fenced up his way\" (Job 19:5), so that he had no liberty of movement. David enumerates among the blessings which he receives of God, the freedom which he enjoys (comp. Psalm 31:8). He is at liberty to go where he likes. and also his footsteps \"do not slip.\" This is rather an independent clause than a consequence. Translate, and my ankles slip not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them (see 1 Samuel 30:8-17; 2 Samuel 8:1-13; 2 Samuel 10:6-18). Neither did I turn again till they were consumed. The greatest severities exercised by David seem to have been those against Edom (1 Kings 11:15, 16) and Ammon (2 Samuel 12:29-31). Otherwise he would seem not to have used, with any great harshness, his rights as a conqueror.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. It is remarkable that the nations which David subdued scarcely ever, while he lived, rose up again in revolt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle. Having boasted of his own actions during the space of two verses (vers. 37, 38), David falls back upon his habitual acknowledgments, that all which he has done has been done wholly through the strength of the Divine arm, which has upheld him, sustained him, and given him the victory. Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me; rather, thou hast bowed down mine adversaries under me (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; i.e. \"thou hast made them turn their backs upon me in flight\" (comp. Exodus 23:27, where the same expression is used). That I might destroy them that hate me. David must not be supposed to speak from personal animosity. He expresses himself as the king of God's people, bound to do his utmost to protect them, and to deliver them from the enemies who \"hate\" him only because he is the leader and champion of his countrymen. The neighbouring nations in David's time seem to have been bent on the total extirpation of the Hebrew people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord, but he answered them not. It seems strange, at first sight, that the heathen enemies of David should \"cry unto the Lord,\" i.e. to Jehovah; and hence some have been driven to suppose that a victory over domestic enemies is here interpolated into the series of foreign victories. But it seems better to explain, with Hengstenberg and the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the heathen did sometimes, as a last resort, pray to a foreign god, whom they seemed to find by experience to be more powerful than their own (see Jonah 1:14). Jehovah was known by name, as the God of the Israelites, to the surrounding nations. Mesha mentions him upon the Moabite Stone; and Sennacherib declared, by the mouth of Rabshakeh, \"Am I come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it? The Lord (Jehovah) said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it\" (2 Kings 18:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind (comp. Psalm 35:5). The enemy were beaten and dispersed so that they seemed driven as dust before the wind. I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. They were made no account of, treated with as little ceremony as the clay in the streets. Language of utter contempt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people. David now approaches his conclusion. In one verse he at once sums up his past deliverances and anticipates fresh glories. God has delivered him from the strivings of those who were hostile to him among his own people (see vers. 4-18), and has also given him victory over the heathen. In the future he will do even more. And thou hast made me the head of the heathen. The antithesis between \"people\" (עָם) and \"heathen,\" or \"nations\" (גויָם), is unmistakable. The long series of David's victories have made him \"head\" over the latter. This is less clearly seen in the history of David's reign than in the description given of the state of the kingdom inherited from David by Solomon (1 Kings 4:21, 24). A people whom I have not known shall serve me. It is not clear that this was ever fulfilled literally in the person of David, and, we are entitled to explain it as a Messianic prophecy, parallel with that of Psalm 2:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; literally, at the hearing of the ear. But the meaning is that given in the Authorized Version. The words aptly describe the conversion of the Gentiles (see Acts 10:34-48; Acts 13:48; Acts 17:11; Acts 18:8, etc.). The strangers shall submit themselves unto me; literally, the sons of the stranger shall pay court to me - not necessarily a false court, as Hengstenberg and others suppose, but, as Dr. Kay explains, an \"obsequious and servile homage.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. Converts are represented as coming into the Church, not merely from love, but partly from fear. The kingdom of the Redeemer at once attracts and alarms. So Isaiah says, \"The nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted... . The sons also of them that afflict thee shall come kneeling unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet, and they shall call thee, The city of the Holy One of Israel\" (Isaiah 60:12-14; see also Micah 7:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 46-50. - This glorious and triumphant psalm concludes with a solemn ascription of praise, blessing, and thanksgiving to Almighty God - partly recapitulation of what has preceded (vers. 47, 48), partly additional (vers. 46, 49, 50). Terms of praise are accumulated, and the whole is made to culminate in a Messianic burst, where David is swallowed up in his \"Seed;\" and the \"Anointed King\" presented to our view is rather the antitype than the type - rather Christ Jesus than the son of Jesse. Verse 46. - The Lord liveth. God was known to Israel as \"the living God\" from the time of Moses (Deuteronomy 5:26). The epithet exalted him above all other so-called gods, who were not living (comp. 2 Kings 19:4; Isaiah 37:4, 17; Daniel 6:26). But it had also a very precious, absolute meaning. God's life was the source of man's. It was through God (who had life in himself) breathing into man the breath of life that man became a living soul (Genesis 2:7). Hence \"the living God\" (Psalm 42:2) is \"the God of our life\" (Psalm 42:8). And blessed be my Rock (see vers. 1, 31). In blessing \"his Rock,\" David blesses God for his qualities of firmness, steadfastness, and trustworthiness. And let the God of my salvation be exalted. \"The God of my salvation\" is a favourite phrase with David (see Psalm 25:5; Psalm 27:9; Psalm 38:22; Psalm 51:14; Psalm 88:1). Other writers use it rarely. When David prays that the God of his salvation (i.e. the God who continually saves him and preserves him) may be \"exalted,\" he probably desires that he may be praised and honoured of all men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - It is God that avengeth me; rather, even the God avengeth me (comp. vers. 3, 6, 14, 17, etc.). And subdueth the people under me; rather, the peoples; i.e. the nations (comp. vers. 37-42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - He delivereth me from mine enemies. The \"deliverance\" was especially from domestic foes (see vers. 17, 19). His foreign foes seem never to have brought David into much peril. Yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me. The \"lifting up\" was above enemies of both kinds (see ver. 43). Thou hast delivered me from the violent man (comp. ver. 17). There is no reason to doubt that in both places Saul is intended. He was at once David's \"enemy,\" and a \"man of violence.\" Were the question open otherwise, it would be closed by the statement in the title.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen. As, in some sense, \"the head of the heathen\" (ver. 43), David was bound to offer prayer, and praise, and thanksgiving \"among them,\" if it were only to teach them by his example, and lead them on towards the worship of the true God. And sing praises unto thy Name; i.e. to thy Person - God being in his Name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm18:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreat deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - Great deliverance giveth he to his king; literally, he magnifies salutations to his king. The primary reference seems to be to the gracious message which God sent to David by Nathan when he had brought the tabernacle into Jerusalem, and purposed to build a \"house\" worthy of it (see 2 Samuel 7:8-16). God had then \"saluted\" David as \"his servant\" (ver. 5), and sent him a message of the most gracious character, even promising the kingdom to him and to his seed \"for ever\" (vers. 13, 16). And showeth mercy to his anointed, to David. No doubt David is primarily intended, both by the \"king\" of the first clause, and by the \"anointed\" of the second; but the combination of the two, and the immediate mention of the \"seed\" which is to reign \"for ever,\" carry the passage beyond the psalmist individually, and give to the conclusion of the psalm, at any rate, a semi-Messianic character. As Hengstenberg says, \"Psalms of this kind are distinguished from those which may more strictly be called Messianic, only by this - that in the latter the Messiah exclusively is brought into view, while here he is presented to our notice only as a member of the seed of David\" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 324, Engl. trans.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The heavens declare the glory of God; literally, the heavens are recounting the glory of God - of El, \"the Mighty One\" - the God of nature (see Romans 1:20). David is perhaps carrying out his declared intention (Psalm 18:49) of praising God among the heathen,\" and therefore takes their standpoint - the ground of nature. And the firmament showeth his handywork. (On \"the firmament,\" see Genesis 1:6, 20.) It is the entire atmosphere enveloping the earth, in which the clouds hang and the birds move. Like the starry heavens above, this, too, \"showeth,\" or rather, \"proclaimeth,\" God's handiwork.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDay unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Day unto day uttereth speech; literally, poureth out speech, as water is poured from a fountain. Each day bears its testimony to the next, and so the stream goes on in a flow that is never broken. And night unto night showeth knowledge. Dr. Kay compares St. Paul's statement, that \"that which may be known of God\" is manifested to man through the creation (Romans 1:19, 20). A certain superiority seems to be assigned to the night, \"as though the contemplation of the starry firmament awakened deeper, more spiritual, thoughts than the brightness of day.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard; rather, there is no speech, there are no words; their voles is not heard; i.e. the speech which they utter is not common speech - it is without sound, without language; no articulate voice is to be heard. (So Ewald, Hup-feld, Perowne, Kay, Hengstenberg, Alexander, and our Revisers.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Their line is gone out through all the earth. It is much disputed what \"their line\" means. The word used, qav (קַו), means, ordinarily, a \"measuring-line\" (Ezekiel 47:3: Zechariah 1:16, etc.), whence it comes to have the further sense of a terminus or boundary; that which the measuring-line marks out. It is also thought to have signified an architect's rule; and, hence, anything regulative, as a decree, precept, or law (see Isaiah 28:10). The LXX. translated it in this place by φθόγγος, \"a musical sound;\" and Dr. Kay supposes \"the regulative chord,\" or \"key-note.\" to be intended. Perhaps \"decree\" would be in this place the best rendering, since it would suit the \"words\" (minim) of the second clause. The \"decree\" of the heavens is one proclaiming the glory of God, and the duty of all men to worship him. And their words to the end of the world. Though they have neither speech nor language, nor any articulate words, yet they have \"words\" in a certain sense. Millim is said to be used of thoughts just shaping themselves into language, but not yet uttered (Kay). In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun. God has made the heavens the sun's dwelling-place, the place where he passes the day. There is, perhaps, a tacit allusion to the Shechinah, which dwelt in the tabernacle of the congregation:NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; literally, and he is as a bridegroom. The bridegroom went forth to meet the bride in glorious apparel, and \"preceded by a blaze of torch-light\" (Kay). The sun's \"chamber\" is where he passes the night - below the earth; from this he bursts forth at morning in his full glory, scattering the darkness, and lighting up his splendid \"tabernacle.\" And rejoiceth as a strong man-to run a race (comp. Judges 5:31, \"As the sun when he goeth forth in his might\"). The Prayer-book Version, if less literal, better conveys the spirit of the original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - His going forth is from the end of the heaven The poet, like other poets, describes the phenomena as they appear to him. He does not broach any astronomical theory. And his circuit (i.e. his course) unto the ends of it; i.e. he proceeds from one end of the heavens to the other. And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. Many things are hidden from the light of the sun, but nothing from its \"heat.\" which is the vital force whence the whole earth receives life and energy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-11. - The transition from the glories of the material universe to the \"law of the Lord\" is abrupt and startling. Some go so far as to say that there is no connection at all between the first and second parts of the psalm. But it is the law and order that pervades the material universe which constitutes its main glory; and the analogy between God's physical laws and his moral laws is evident, and generally admitted (see the great work of Bishop Butler, part 1.). Verse 7. - The Law of the Lord is perfect. Whatsoever proceeds from God is perfect in its kind; his \"Law\" especially - the rule of life to his rational creatures. That salvation is not by the Law is not the fault of the Law, but of man, who cannot keep it. \"The Law\" itself \"is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Romans 7:12). Converting (rather, as in the margin, restoring) the soul. The word employed, meshibah, is used of restoring from disorder and decay (Psalm 80:19), from sorrow and affliction (Ruth 4:15), from death (1 Kings 17:21, 22). The Law, by instructing men, restores them from moral blindness to the light which is theirs by nature (Romans 1:19), and, as a further consequence, in many cases, restores them from sin to righteousness. The testimony of the Lord is sure. 'Eduth - the word translated \"testimony\" - is employed especially of the Decalogue (Exodus 25:16, 21, 22, 26; Numbers 9:15; 17:23; 18:2, etc.); but may be regarded as sue of the many synonyms under which the whole Law may be spoken of (see Psalm 119:2, 14, 22, 24, 88, etc.). The Law is \"sure\" - i.e. fixed, firm, stable - in comparison with the fleeting, shifting, unstable judgments of human reason. Making wise the simple; i.e. enlightening their moral judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; rather, the precepts of the Lord are right. Another of the many synonyms under which the Law may be spoken of (see Dr. Kay's preface to the hundred and nineteenth psalm). God's precepts \"rejoice the heart\" of the godly. They are not felt as stern commands, but as gracious intimations of what God desires man to do for his own good. The commandment of the Lord is pure; i.e. spotless, clean, without fault (comp. ver. 7, \"The Law of the Lord is perfect\"). Enlightening the eyes; i.e. giving light to the intellect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever. Hengstenberg explains \"the fear of the Lord\" in this place as \"the instruction afforded by God for fearing him.\" And certainly, unless we adopt some such explanation, we shall find it difficult to account for the intrusion of the clause into its present position. The Law, the testimony, the statutes (or precepts), the commandment (vers. 7, 8), and the judgments (ver. 9), are external to man, objective; the fear of the Lord. as commonly understood, is internal, subjective, a \"settled habit of his soul.\" It is not a thing of the same kind with the other five nominatives, and appears out of place among them. Hence it seems best, with Professor Alexander, to adopt Hengstenberg's explanation. The Law, viewed as teaching the fear of God, is undoubtedly \"clean \" - i.e. pure, perfect - and \"endures for ever,\" or is of perpetual obligation. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. In \"judgments\" we have another of the recognized synonyms for the entire Law (Psalm 119:7, 13, 43, 52, 62), which is from first to last \"exceeding righteous and true\" (Psalm 119:138, Prayer-book Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMore to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold. (For the difference between \"gold\" (זהב) and \"fine gold\" (פז), see the 'Homiletic Commentary on Job,' p. 458.) God's Law is a far greater good to man, and therefore far more to be desired, than any amount of riches; much more must it be preferable to honey and the honeycomb.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Moreover by them is thy servant warned. This verse is a sort of connecting link between the second and the third parts of the psalm. Through its subject-matter, which is still the Law of the Lord, it belongs to the second part; but metrically, and by the introduction of the person of the psalmist (\"thy servant\"), it belongs to the third. David feels that to him it is the crowning excellency of the Law, that it teaches, instructs, or \"warns\" him. And in keeping of them there is great reward. Not only the reward promised in Exodus 15:26, or \"the recompense of the reward\" laid up for men in heaven, but a present reward \"in the act of keeping them\" (Kay). Obedience, like virtue, is its own reward.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - A consideration of the Law cannot but raise the thought of transgression. Man \"had not known sin but by the Law\" (Romans 7:7), and he cannot contemplate the Law without being reminded of possible disobedience to it. The psalmist's thoughts are led in this direction, and he ends with an earnest prayer against \"secret sins\" (ver. 12), against \"presumptuous sins\" (ver. 13), and against sins of word and thought (ver. 14), addressed to \"God his Strength [or, 'his Rock'] and his Redeemer.\" Verse 12. - Who can understand his errors? rather, who can discern (or, perceive) his errors? i.e. all of them. Who will not overlook some, try as he may to search out his heart? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Those which are hidden from me, which I cannot discern.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins (comp. Exodus 21:14; Numbers 15:30; Deuteronomy 17:12). Wilful, intentional, deliberate sins are intended - such as cut off from grace. They are called \"presumptuous ones,\" being \"personified as tyrants who strive to bring the servant of God into unbecoming subjection to them\" (Hengstenberg). Let them not have dominion over me (comp. Psalm 119:133; Romans 6:14). Then shall I be upright; or, \"blameless\" (ἄμωμος, LXX.). And I shall be innocent from the great transgression. There is no article in the original. Translate, and innocent of great transgression (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight. Nor let my doings only be righteous; let the door of my lips be kept, that I utter no evil word, and the recesses of my heart be purged, that I think no evil thought. O Lord, my strength; literally, my Rock (צוּדִי), as in Psalm 18:1. And my Redeemer (comp. Psalm 78:35; and see Genesis 48:16; Exodus 15:13; Leviticus 25:48; Ruth 4:4; Job 19:25; Isaiah 63:9). As applied to God, the word \"Redeemer\" (גואֵל) always means a \"Deliverer\" from sin, or death, or danger.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Blessed is the man; literally, blessings are to the man. But the Authorized Version exactly gives the sense (comp. Psalm 2:12). That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly. The margin gives, \"or wicked,\" and this is probably the best rendering of the word used (רשׁעים). The righteous man is first described negatively, under three heads.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) He \"does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly:\" i.e. he does not throw in his lot with the wicked does not participate in their projects or designs;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) he standeth not in the way of sinners; i.e. he does not take part in their actions, does not follow the same moral paths; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) he sitteth not in the seat of the scornful; i.e. has no fellowship with them in the \"scorn\" which they cast upon religion. The word used for scornful (לֵצ) is Solomonian (Proverbs 1:22; Proverbs 3:34; Proverbs 13:1), but in the Psalter occurs only in this place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - But his delight is in the Law of the Lord.

The \"Law\" intended - תורה, not התּורה - is probably not the mere Law of Moses, but God's law, as made known to man in any way. Still, the resemblance of the passage to Joshua 1:8 shows the Law of Moses to have been very specially in the writer's thoughts. In his Law doth he meditate day and night; compare, besides Joshua 1:8, the following: Psalm 63:6; Psalm 119:15, 48, 78, 97. Constant meditation in God's Law has characterized all saint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water. The comparison of a man to a. tree is frequent in the Book of Job (Job 8:16, 17; 14:7-10; 15:32, 33, etc.), and occurs once in the Pentateuch (Numbers 24:6). We find it again in Psalm 92:12-14, and frequently in the prophets. The \"rivers of water\" spoken of (פַּלְגַ־מָיִם) are undoubtedly the \"streams\" (Revised Version) or \"canals of irrigation\" so common both in Egypt and in Babylonia, by which fruit trees were planted, as especially date-palms, which need the vicinity of water. That such planting of trees by the waterside was known to the Israelites is evident, both from this passage and from several others, as Numbers 24:6; Ecclesiastes 2:5; Jeremiah 17:8; Ezekiel 17:5, 8, etc. It is misplaced ingenuity to attempt to decide what particular tree the writer had in his mind, whether the palm, or the oleander, or any other, since he may not have been thinking of any particular tree. That bringeth forth his fruit in his season. Therefore not the oleander, which has no fruit, and is never planted in the East, but grows naturally along the courses of streams. His leaf also shall not wither. Compare the contrary threat of Isaiah against the wicked of his time, \"Ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water\" (Isaiah 1:30). And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper; rather, perhaps, in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The ungodly are not so; or, the wicked (see the comment on ver. 1. But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. \"Chaff\" is used throughout Scripture as an emblem of what is weak and worthless (see Job 21:18; Psalm 35:5; Isaiah 5:24; Isaiah 17:13; Isaiah 29:5; Isaiah 33:11; Isaiah 41:15; Jeremiah 23:28; Daniel 2:35; Hosea 13:3; Zephaniah 2:2; Matthew 3:12; Luke 3:17). In ancient times it was considered of no value at all, and when corn was winnowed, it was thrown up in the air until the wind had blown all the chaff away (see the representation in the author's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 163).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Therefore the ungodly (or, the wicked) shall not stand in the judgment. \"Therefore,\" as being chaff, i.e. \"destitute of spiritual vitality\" (Kay), \"the wicked shall not stand,\" or shall not rise up, \"in the judgment,\" i.e. in the judgment of the last day. So the Targum, Rashi, Dr. Kay, Canon Cook, and others. It is certainly not conceivable that any human judgment is intended by \"the judgment\" (הַמִּשְׁפָט), and though possibly \"all manifestations of God's punitive righteousness are comprehended\" (Hengstenberg), yet the main idea must be that the wicked shall not be able to \"stand,\" or\" rise up,\" i.e. \"hold up their heads\" (Aglen), in the last day. Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. Here the human judgment comes in. Sinners will be cast out, not only from heaven, but also from the Church, or \"congregation of the righteous,\" if not before, at any rate when the \"congregation\" is finally made up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous.

God \"knows the way of the righteous,\" and therefore they live and prosper; he does not know the way of the wicked, and therefore the way of the (wicked, or) ungodly shall perish (compare the beginning and end of Psalm 112.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble. The people intercede for their king in a \"clay of trouble\" or \"distress,\" when danger impends, and he is about to affront it. They are made to ask, first of all, that God will hear the king's prayers, which are no doubt being silently offered while they pray aloud. The Name of the God of Jacob defend thee. (On the force of the expression, \"the Name of God,\" see the comment upon Psalm 7:17.) \"Jacob's God\" - a favourite expression with David - is the God who made him the promise, \"I will be with thee, and I will keep thee in all places whither thou goest\" (Genesis 28:15). \"Defend thee\" is scarcely a correct rendering. Translate, exalt thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Send thee help from the sanctuary. \"The sanctuary\" here is undoubtedly the holy place which David had established on Mount Zion, and in which he had placed the ark of the covenant. God's help was always regarded as coming especially from the place where he had \"set his Name.\" In the original it is, \"Send thy help\" - the help thou needest and prayest for. And strengthen thee out of Zion; rather, support thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Remember all thy offerings.

It is not to be supposed, however, that David ever sacrificed victims with his own hand, or without the intervention of a priest. And accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. It is a reasonable conjecture that the \"Selah\" here marks a \"pause,\" during which special sacrifices were offered, with a view of entreating God's favour and protection in the coming war (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGrant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Grant thee according to thine own heart; i.e. whatever thy heart desireth \"in connection with this expedition, all that thou hopest from it, all that thou wouldst have it accomplish.\" And fulfil all thy counsel; ¢.e. make all thy plans to prosper.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - We will rejoice in thy salvation.

And in the Name of our God we will set up our banners. Plant them, i.e., on the enemy's forts and strongholds. The Lord fulfil all thy petitions. A comprehensive prayer, re-echoing the first clause of ver. 1 and the whole of ver. 4, but reaching out further to all that the monarch may at any future time request of God, The first part of the psalm here ends, and the people pause for a while.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6.

The offering of the solemn prayer (vers. 1-5) and of the sacrifices (see the comment on ver. 3) has been followed by a full conviction that the prayer is granted, and the triumph of David assured. What was previously hoped for is \"now known.\" That the Lord saveth (or, hath saved) his anointed (comp. Psalm 18:50). He will hear him from his holy heaven; literally, from the heaven of his holiness. With the saving strength of his right hand.

The enemies of David towards the north - Syrians of Zobah, and Maachah, and Damascus, and Beth-Rehob - were especially formidable on account of their cavalry and their chariots. David on one occasion \"took from Hadarezer, King of Zobah, a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen\" (1 Chronicles 18:4). On another he \"slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots\" (1 Chronicles 19:18). His own troops appear to have consisted entirely of footmen. But we will remember the Name of the Lord our God. Our trust, i.e., shall be in the Lord, who has commanded our kings \"not to multiply horses\" (Deuteronomy 17:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They are brought down and fallen; but we are risen, and stand upright.

Authorities are thus nearly equally balanced on the point; and we are at liberty to translate either, \"Save, Lord: may the King hear us when we call!\" or, \"O Lord save the king: maybe hear us when we call (upon him)!\" On the whole, perhaps, the former is preferable (see the arguments of Professor Alexander, 'Commentary on the Psalms,' p. 94).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The king shall joy.

The pause here may have been for the presentation of a thank-offering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness; i.e. thou givest him blessings before he asks, and more than he asks.. \"The blessings of goodness\" is pleonastic, since a blessing cannot be otherwise than a good. Thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head. It is remarked that David, as the result of one of his wars, did actually take the crown of the conquered king, which was a crown of gold, from off the king' s head, and place it upon his own head (2 Samuel 12:30); but this is scarcely what is intended here. As Hengstenberg observes, \"The setting on of the crown marks the bestowment of dominion,\" not in one petty ease only, but generally, and is scarcely to be altogether separated from the promises recorded in 2 Samuel 7:12-16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. The \"life\" intended cannot be ordinary human life, since in David' s case this certainly did not continue \"for ever and ever.\" We must understand the psalmist to have asked for continuance in his posterity, and this was guaranteed him in the message which God sent him by Nathan (2 Samuel 7:13, 16). In the full sense the promise was, of course, Messianic, being fulfilled only in Christ, the God-Man, who alone of David' s posterity \"liveth for ever.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - His glory is great in thy salvation. David' s glory exceeds that of all other living men, through the \"salvation\" which God vouchsafes him. That salvation is partly temporal, consisting in deliverance from his foes; partly of an unearthly and spiritual character, arising out of his relationship to the coming Messiah. It is from the latter point of view, rather than the former, that it is said, Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For thou hast made him most blessed for ever; literally, for thou settest him to be blessings for ever. Thou makest him, i.e., to be a perennial source of blessings to men. As all mankind were blessed in Abraham (Genesis 12:3; Genesis 18:18; Genesis 22:18), i.e. in his seed, so were they all blessed in David' s seed. Thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance; i.e. with thy favour and protection, so frequently and so markedly extended to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For the king trusteth in the Lord. This is at once the ground and the result of God' s favour to him. God favours David because of his trust, and David trusts in God because of his favour. The result is that, through the mercy (or, loving-kindness, Revised Version) of the Most High he shall not be moved (comp. Psalm 15:5; Psalm 112:6). The words appear to denote a conviction, as Professor Alexander says, that David \"would never be shaken from his standing in God' s favour.\" This conviction we may well conceive him to have felt, and to have regarded as one that might fittingly be expressed by his subjects, in whose mouth he placed it. But such a conviction is not always borne out by events, and David confesses elsewhere, that, at any rate, once in his life, after he had said, \"I shall never be moved,\" God \"hid away his face from him,\" and he \"was troubled\" (Psalm 30:6, 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-12. - In this second portion of the psalm, the people address themselves to David, anticipating future glories for him. \"Having shown what God would do for his anointed, the psalm now describes what the latter shall accomplish through Divine assistance\" (Alexander). Past success is taken as a guarantee of victory over all other enemies. Verse 8. - Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; i.e. \"shall reach them, attain them, punish them\" (comp. 1 Samuel 31:3). Thy right hand (the hand of greater power) shall find out those that hate thee; and, of' course, punish them severely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger. Some suppose a reference to the event mentioned in 2 Samuel 12:31, \"He (David) made them (the Ammonites) to pass through the brick-kiln.;\" but the expression \"fiery oven\" is probably not intended to be taken literally, but metaphorically. Severe suffering is continually compared in Scripture to confinement in an oven or furnace (see Deuteronomy 4:20; 1 Kings 8:51; Isaiah 48:10; Jeremiah 11:4; Ezekiel 22:18, 20, 22; Malachi 4:1). And we may best understand the present passage to mean simply that in the time of his anger David would subject such of his enemies as fell into his hands to very terrible sufferings. (See, as showing what extreme severities David did sometimes inflict on captured enemies, 2 Samuel 12:31 which is to the point, as also is 1 Kings 11:15, 16.) The Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. The metaphor is followed up, with the addition that what was previously attributed to David alone is here declared to have the sanction of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth; i.e. their offspring or progeny. Joab, by David' s orders, remained in Edom \"until he had cut off every male\" (1 Kings 11:16). And their seed from among the children of men. The second clause, as so often, re-echoes the first; without adding anything to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For they intended evil against thee. Their destruction is brought upon them by their own selves. They plot against the people of God, and thus provoke God to anger, and cause him to deliver them into their enemy' s hand. It does not matter that they can effect nothing. The \"intention\" is enough. They imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. The inability is not so much from a deficiency of strength in themselves, as from the opposition offered to their schemes by God. The best-laid plans an powerless, if God wills to baffle them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back; literally, their neck (comp. Psalm 18:40). The meaning is simply, \"Thou shalt put them to flight.\" When thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. The Authorized Version, by supplying \"when\" and \"thine arrows,\" expresses what the psalmist has left to the intelligence of the reader. The psalmist says, \"Thou shalt put them to flight; thou shalt make ready upon thy strings against the face of them, no doubt meaning that the discharge of arrows would produce the hasty flight, but not saying it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength. The psalm, as already remarked, ends, as it began, with the praise of God. \"Be thou exalted\" means, \"Be thou lifted up, both in thyself, and in the praises of thy people\" (comp. Psalm 18:46; Psalm 46:10). So will we sing and praise thy power. We, at any rate, will do our part to exalt thee. Our tongues shall ever sing of the great deeds thou doest for us.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Not a cry of despair, but a cry of loving faith, \"My God, my God - Why hast thou for a time withdrawn thyself?\" It is remarkable that our Lord's quotation of this passage does not follow exactly either the Hebrew or the Chaldee paraphrase - the Hebrew having 'azab-thani for sabacthani, and the Chaldee paraphrase metul ma for lama. May we not conclude that it is the thought, and not its verbal expression by the sacred writers, that is inspired? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? It is very doubtful whether our translators have done right in supplying the words which they have added. The natural translation of the Hebrew would be, Far from my salvation are the words of my roaring. And this rendering yields a sufficiently good sense, viz. \"Far from effecting my salvation (or deliverance) are the words of my roaring;\" i.e. of my loud complaint. Our Lord's \"strong crying and tears\" in the garden (Hebrews 5:7) did not produce his deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; rather, thou answerest not; i.e. thou dost not interpose to deliver me. And in the night season, and am not silent (see Matthew 26:36-44; Mark 14:34-39; Luke 22:41-44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But thou art holy. Still God is holy; the Sufferer casts no reproach upon him, but \"commits himself to him that judgeth righteously\" (1 Peter 2:23). O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. God is seen enthroned in his sanctuary, where the praises and prayers of Israel are ever being offered up to him. If he hears them, he will assuredly, in his own good time, hear the Sufferer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Our fathers trusted in thee. It sustains the Sufferer to think how many before him have cried to God, and trusted in him, and for a while been seemingly not heard, and yet at length manifestly heard and saved. They trusted in thee, and thou didst (ultimately) deliver them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They cried unto thee, and were delivered. If they were delivered because they cried, the Sufferer who cries \"day and night\" (vex. 2) can scarcely remain unheard for ever. They trusted in thee, and were not confounded; or, were not put to shame (οὐ κατησχύνθησαν, LXX.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But I am a worm, and no man (comp. Job 25:6; Isaiah 41:14). The worm is a symbol of extreme weakness and helplessness - it is naturally despised, derided, trodden upon. A reproach of men, and despised of the people (Comp. Isaiah 49:7; Isaiah 53:3; and for the fulfilment, see Matthew 27:39). How deeply Christ was \"despised of the people\" appeared most evidently when they expressed their desire that, instead of him, a murderer should be granted to them (Acts 3:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - All they that see me laugh me to scorn; ἐξεμυκτήρισάν με, LXX. (comp. Luke 23:35, \"The people stood beholding;and the rulers also with them derided him (ἐξεμυκτήριζον)\"). They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying (see Matthew 27:39; Mark 15:29: \"They that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,\" where the expression of the Septuagint is again used).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him. This is a translation of the Septuagint Version rather than of the Hebrew text, which runs, Trust in the Lord (literally, Roll [thy care] upon the Lord): let him deliver him. Let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him. St. Matthew has put it on record that this text was actually cited by the scribes and elders who witnessed the Crucifixion, and applied to our Lord in scorn (Matthew 27:43). They quoted apparently from the Septuagint, but with an inaccuracy common at the time, when books were scarce, and persons had to depend on their memory of what they had occasionally heard read.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But thou art he that took me out of the womb (comp. Job 10:8-11). God's creatures have always a claim upon him from the very fact that they are his creatures. Every sufferer may appeal to God as his Maker, and therefore bound to be his Helper and Preserver. Thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. Thou gavest me the serene joy and trust of infancy - that happy time to which man looks back with such deep satisfaction. Every joy, every satisfaction, came from thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I was cast upon thee from the womb. In a certain sense this is true of all; but of the Holy Child it was most true (Luke 2:40, 49, 52). He was \"cast\" on God the Father's care in an especial way. Thou art my God from my mother's belly. The Child Jesus was brought near to God from his birth (Luke 1:35; Luke 2:21, 22). From the first dawn of consciousness God was his God (Luke 2:40, 49).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Be not far from me. The considerations dwelt upon in vers. 3-5, and again in veto. 9, 10, have removed the sense of desertion expressed in vex. 1; and the Sufferer can now confidently call on God to help him. \"Be not far from me,\" he says, for trouble is near. The time is come when aid is most urgently required. For there is none to help; literally, not a helper. David himself had never been in such straits. He had always had friends and followers. Under Saul's persecution he had a friend in Jonathan; he was supported by his father and his brethren (1 Samuel 22:1); in a short time he found himself at the head of four hundred (1 Samuel 22:2), and then of six hundred men (1 Samuel 25:13). In Absalom's rebellion there remained faithful to him the priestly tribe (2 Samuel 15:24) and the Gibborim (2 Samuel 15:18), and others to the number of some thousands (2 Samuel 18:4). But he whom David prefigured, his Antitype, was desexed, was alone - \"All the disciples forsook him and fled\" (Matthew 26:56) - he was truly one that \"had no helper.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Many bulls have compassed me. The Sufferer represents the adversaries who crowd around him under the figure of \"bulls\" - fierce animals in all parts of the world, and in Palestine particularly' wild and ferocious. \"Bulls,, and buffaloes are very numerous, says Canon Tristram, \"in Southern Judaea; they are in the habit of gathering in a circle around any novel or unaccustomed object, and may be easily instigated into charging with their horns\" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 71). Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. Bashan, the richest pasture-g\"round of Palestine, produces the largest and strongest animals (Ezekiel 39:18). Hence \"the kine of Bashan\" became an expression for powerful oppressors (Amos 4:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They gaped upon me with their mouths. One metaphor is superseded by another. Fierce and threatening as bulls, the adversaries are ravenous as lions. They \"gape with their mouths,\" eager to devour, ready to spring on the prey and crush it in their monstrous jaws. As a ravening and a roaring lion. The tumult and noise made by those who demanded our Lord's death are noted by the evangelist, περισσῶς ἔκραζον - θόρυβος γίνεται (Matthew 27:23, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I am poured out like water (comp. Psalm 58:7; 2 Samuel 14:14). The exact meaning is uncertain; but extreme' weakness and exhaustion, something like utter prostration, seems to be indicated. And all my bones are out of joint. The strain of the body suspended on the cross would all but dislocate the joints of the arms, and would be felt in every bone of the body. My heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. The proximate cause of death in crucifixion is often failure of the heart's action, the supply of venous b]cod not being sufficient to stimulate it. Hence palpitation, faintness, and final syncope.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My strength is dried up like a potsherd. All strength dies out under the action of the many acute pains which rack the whole frame, and as little remains as there remains of moisture in a potsherd. And my tongue cleaveth to my jaws. An extreme and agonizing thirst sets in - the secretions generally fail - and the saliva especially is suppressed, so that the mouth feels parched and dry. Hence the cry of suffering which was at last wrung from our Lord, when, just before the end, he exclaimed, \"I thirst\" (John 19:28). And thou hast brought me into the dust of death. \"The dust of death\" is a periphrasis for death itself, which is so closely associated in our thoughts with the dust of the tomb (see below, ver. 29; and comp. Psalm 30:10; Psalm 104:29; and Job 10:9; Job 34:35; Ecclesiastes 3:20; Ecclesiastes 12:7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For dogs have compassed me. \"Dogs\" now encompass the Sufferer, perhaps the subordinate agents in the cruelties - the rude Roman soldiery, who laid rough hands on the adorable Person (Matthew 27:27-35). Oriental dogs are savage and of unclean habits, whence the term \"dog\" in the East has always been, and still is, a term of reproach. The assembly of the wicked have enclosed me; or, a band of wicked ones have shut me in. The \"band\" of Roman soldiers (Mark 15:16) seems foreshadowed. They pierced my hands and my feet. There are no sufficient critical grounds for relinquishing (with Hengstenberg) this interpretation. It has the support of the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Arabic, and the Vulgate Versions, and is maintained by Ewald, Reinke, Bohl, Moll, Kay, the writer in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and our Revisers. Whether the true reading be kaaru (כָאְרַוּ) or kaari (כָאֲרִי), the sense will be the same, kaarl being the apocopated participle of the verb, whereof kaaru is the 3rd pers. plu. indic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I may tell all my bones. Our Lord's active life and simple habits would give him a spare frame, while the strain of crucifixion would accentuate and bring into relief every point of his anatomy. He might thus, if so minded, \"tell all his bones.\" They look and stare upon me (comp. Luke 23:35, \"And the people stood beholding\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. It has been well observed that \"the act here described is not applicable either to David or to any personage whose history is recorded in the Bible, save to Jesus\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 221). Two evangelists (Matthew 27:35; John 19:24) note the fulfilment of the prophecy in the conduct of the soldiers at the crucifixion of Christ. The circumstance is reserved for the final touch in the picture, since it marked that all was over; the Victim was on the point of expiring; he would never need his clothes again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - But be not thou far from me, O Lord (comp. ver. 11). The special trouble for which he had invoked God's aid having been minutely described, the Sufferer reverts to his prayer, which he first repeats, and then strengthens and enforces by requesting that the aid may be given speedily, O my strength, haste thee to help me. Eyaluth, the abstract term used for \"strength,\" seems to mean \"source, or substance, of all strength.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Deliver my soul from the sword. \"The sword\" symbolizes the authority of the Roman governor - that authority by which Christ was actually put to death. If he prayed, even on the cross, to be delivered from it, the prayer must have been offered with the reservations previously made in Gethsemane, \"If it be possible\" (Matthew 26:39); \"If thou be willing\" (Luke 22:42); \"Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.\" The human will in Christ was in favour of the deliverance; the Divine will, the same in Christ as in his Father, was against it. My darling - literally, my only one - from the power of the dog. By \"my darling\" there is no doubt that the soul is intended, both here and in Psalm 35:17. It seems to be so called as the most precious thing that each man possesses (see Matthew 16:26). \"The dog\" is used, not of an individual, but of the class, and is best explained, like the \"dogs\" in ver. 16, of the executioners.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Save me from the lion's mouth (comp. ver. 13). Either the chief persecutors, viewed as a class, or Satan, their instigator, would seem to be intended. For thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns; rather, even from the horns of the win oxen hast thou heard me. The conviction suddenly comes to the Sufferer that he is heard. Still, the adversaries are round about him - the \"dogs,\" the \"lions,\" and the \"strong bulls of Bashan,\" now showing as ferocious wild cattle, menacing him with their horns. But all the Sufferer's feelings are changed. The despondent mood has passed away. He is not forsaken. He has One to help. In one way or another he knows himself - feels himself - delivered; and he passes from despair and agony into a condition of perfect peace, and even exultation. He passes, in fact, from death to life, from humiliation to glory; and at once he proceeds to show forth his thankfulness by a burst of praise. The last strophe of the psalm (vers. 22-31) is the jubilant song of the Redeemer, now that his mediatorial work is done, and his life of suffering \"finished\" (John 19:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I will declare thy Name unto my brethren. The thought of the brethren is uppermost. As, when the body was removed, loving messages were at once sent to the disciples (Matthew 28:10; John 20:17), so, with the soul of the Redeemer in the intermediate state, the \"brethren\" are the first care. God's Name, and all that he has done - the acceptance of the sacrifice, the effectuation of man's salvation - shall be made known to them (see Hebrews 2:9-12). In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee. He will join with them in praising and adoring his Father, so soon as circumstances allow (compare the Eucharist at Emmaus, Luke 24:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel. \"All Israel:\" all the people of God are called upon to join in the praise which the Sea will henceforth offer to the Father through eternity. The praise of God is to be joined with the fear of God, according to the universal teaching of Scripture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted. The Father might seem by his passivity to disregard his Son's affliction; but it was not really so. Every pang was marked, every suffering sympathized with. And the reward received from the Father was proportionate (see Isaiah 53:12, \"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death;\" and Philippians 2:8-11, \"He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name: that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\"). Neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. There was no real turning away, no real forsaking. Every cry was heard, and the cries were answered at the fitting moment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation. The phraseology is that of the Mosaic dispensation, with which alone David was acquainted. But the fulfilment is in those services of praise where, whenever Christ's disciples are gathered together, there is he in the midst of them. I will pay my vows before them that fear him. \"Vows,\" in the strict sense of the word, are scarcely meant; rather \"devotions\" generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The meek shall eat and be satisfied. In the Eucharistic feasts of Christ's kingdom it is \"the meek\" especially who shall eat, and be satisfied, feeling that they have all their souls long for - a full banquet, of the very crumbs of which they are not worthy. They shall praise the Lord that seek him. The service shall be emphatically one of praise. Your heart shall live for ever. The result shall be life for evermore; for the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, worthily received, preserve men's bodies and souls to everlasting life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord. The Gentiles from every quarter shall come into the new kingdom, remembering him whom they had so long forgotten, Jehovah, the true God. And all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. Pleonastic. A repetition of the idea contained in the preceding clause.

Christ has taken the kingdom, and even now rules on the earth - not yet wholly over willing subjects, but over a Church that is ever expanding more and more, and tending to become universal. And he is the Governor among the nations. Not the Governor of one nation only, but of all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship. The Christian feast is not for the poor and needy only, like Jewish sacrificial feasts, but for the \"fat ones\" of the earth as well - the rich and prosperous. As Hengstenberg observes, \"This great spiritual feast is not unworthy of the presence even of those who live in the greatest abundance: it contains a costly viand, which all their plenty cannot give - a viand for which even the satisfied are hungry; and, on the other hand, the most needy and most miserable are not excluded\" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 396). All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him; i.e. all mortal men what-soever - all that are on their way to the tomb - shall bow before Christ, either willingly as his worshippers, or unwillingly as his conquered enemies, made to lick the dust at his feet. And none can keep alive his own soul. Life is Christ's gift; the soul cannot be kept alive except through him, by his quickening Spirit (John 6:53, 63).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - A seed shall serve him. The Church is founded on a rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. So long as the world endures, Christ shall always have worshippers - a \"seed\" which will \"serve\" him. It shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. If we accept this rendering, we must understand that the seed of the first set of worshippers shall be the Lord's people for one generation, the seed of the next for another, and so on. But it is suggested that the true meaning is, \"This shall be told of the Lord to generation after generation\" (so Hengstenberg, Kay, Alexander, and our Revisers).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm22:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this. One generation after another shall come, and shall report God's righteousness, as shown forth in Christ, each to its successor - a people yet to be born - telling them that God \"has done this;\" i.e. effected all that is here sketched out, and so accomplished the work of redemption.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord is my Shepherd. This metaphor, so frequent in the later Scriptures (Isaiah 40:11; Isaiah 49:9, 10; Jeremiah 31:10; Ezekiel 34:6-19; John 10:11-19, 26-28; Hebrews 13:20; 1 Peter 2:25; 1 Peter 5:4; Revelation 7:17), is perhaps implied in Genesis 48:15, but first appears, plainly and openly, in the Davidical psalms (see, besides the present passage, Psalm 74:1; Psalm 77:20; Psalm 78:53; 79:14; 80:1 - psalms which, if not David's, belong to the time, and were written under the influence, of David). It is a metaphor specially consecrated to us by our Lord's employment and endorsement of it (John 10:11-16). I shall not want. The Prayer-book Version brings out the full sense, \"Therefore can I lack nothing\" (comp. Deuteronomy 2:7; Deuteronomy 8:9; and Matthew 6:31-33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; literally, in grassy homesteads - \" the richer, oasis-like spots, where a homestead would be fixed in a barren tract of land\" (Kay). He leadeth me beside the still waters; rather, waters of refreshment; ἐπὶ υ{δατος ἀναπαύσεως (LXX.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He restoreth my soul; i.e. revives it and reinvigorates it when it is exhausted and weary (see the comment on Is. 19:7, where the same verb occurs). He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness. Which are also \"paths of pleasantness and peace\" (Proverbs 3:17). For his Name's sake. To magnify his Name as a gracious and merciful God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. A sudden transition and contrast, such as David loved. The quiet paths of righteousness and peace remind the poet of the exact opposite - the dark and dismal way through the valley of the shadow of death. Even when so situated, he does not, he will not, fear. I will fear no evil, he says. And why? For thou art with me. The same Protector, the same gracious and merciful God, will be still with him - leading him, guiding his steps, shepherding him, keeping him from evil. Thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff - i.e. thy shepherd's crook, and thy staff of defence - they comfort me. They make me feel that, however long and however dreary the way through the dark vale, I shall still have thy guidance and thy protection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Another transition. The danger of death is past. David reverts to the thought of the tranquil, happy, joyous time which God has vouchsafed to grant him. He has \"adversaries,\" indeed, but they are powerless to effect anything against hint They have to look on with ill-concealed annoyance at his prosperity, to see his table amply spread; his condition such as men generally envy; his wealth typified by abundant oil - thou anointest (or, makest fat, marginal rendering) my head with oil - great, his whole life full to overflowing with blessedness. My cup runneth over, he declares - is not only full to the brim, but runs over the brim - an expressive metaphor, indicative of a state of bliss rarely experienced in this life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. The past is an earnest of the future, As God's \"goodness and mercy\" have always followed him hitherto, David has no doubt that they will continue to cling to him while his life continues. And I will dwell. in the house of the Lord for ever (comp. Psalm 27:4, \"One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple\"). Such passages are, of course, not to be understood literally; they express the longing of the soul for a sense of the continual presence of God, and a realization of constant communion with him.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - - The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. God's glory was set forth in Psalm 19. from a consideration of the heavens (vers. 1-6); here it is manifested from the other half of creation - the earth. The whole earth, and all its fnlness, is his. He made it, and he remains its sole Owner and Master. There is no inferior δημιουργός, as some believed, who framed it and governs it. All its marvels, all its beauty, all its richness, proceed from God alone. The world, and they that dwelt therein. \"The world\" (תֵּבֵל) seems to be here synonymous with\" the earth\" (הָאָרֶצ). Not only do its material products belong to God, but its inhabitants also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods (comp. Genesis 1:9). God has established the earth above the seas and floods, causing it to \"appear,\" and thus making it a fitting habitation for man. Hence his right of property in the earth and in all the dwellers on it. They exist through his providential care (comp. Psalm 104:6-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? The second strophe opens with one of David's sudden transitions. Who is worthy to be brought into contact with a God of such might and glory? Who shall ascend into his hill? God's \"hill\" is, in reality, the highest heaven, wherein he has his dwelling-place. Its representative on earth was, at this time, the Mount Zion, where it was already determined in the Divine counsels that the temple should be built, and whither David was now about to transfer the ark of the covenant (see the introductory paragraph). David asks the question as a warning to the Levites, whom he was about to employ in the transport of the ark, that they might purify themselves in heart and soul before venturing to take part in the solemn ceremony. Or who shall stand in his holy place? Who, i.e., shall stand and minister inside the tabernacle, when the ark has been placed therein, and it has thus become, in a special sense, God's holy place?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He that hath clean hands. He whose hands are free from acts of sin (comp. Psalm 15:2-5), and not only so, but he who hath also a pure heart, since the heart is the source of all evil (Matthew 15:19, 20), and wrongful words and wicked acts are the necessary results of the heart being impure. \"God's demands upon his people,\" as Hengstenberg observes, \"go beyond the domain of action. Those only see him - those only are fit to ascend into his hill - who have a pure heart.\" Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity; i.e. who has not lusted after vain and worthless things, whose desires are subdued, brought into captivity to the Law of God, and kept under strict control. This is really implied in purity of heart. Nor sworn deceitfully. False swearing is the worst - or, at any rate, one of the worst - sins of the tongue. The psalmist means to say that a man is not fit to draw near to God unless he is righteous in act, in thought, and in word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He shall receive the blessing from the Lord; rather, blessing, without the article. On the pure in thought, word, and act, God's blessing is sure to rest (see Matthew 5:8). And righteousness from the God of his salvation. To the man who comes to God with an honest and true heart, God will give additional graces, such as justification, assurance, perseverance, unwavering hope, perfect charity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This is the generation of them that seek him. Men with this character impressed upon them are the \"generation,\" the stamp of men, whom God will recognize and accept as his worshippers, true seekers after him. That seek thy face, O Jacob. The LXX. have, Ζητούντων τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ Θεοῦ Ἰακώβ, whence some suppose אלהי to have fallen out of the Hebrew text. This, no doubt, is possible, and removes all difficulty. But it is better to loose a Gordian knot than to cut it. We may keep the present text, and obtain a satisfactory sense, by regarding \"Jacob\" as grammatically in apposition with \"generation,\" and translating, \"This is the generation of them that seek him - that seek thy face - even Jacob.\" All they are not Israel who are of Israel (Romans 9:6). The true Jacob consisted of those Israelites who answered to the character described in ver. 4. Selah. A break, or pause, here occurred, while the procession of Levites advanced to the very gates of the sanctuary. Then the strain was resumed - the choir being divided into two parts, which sang antiphonally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Lift up your heads, O ye gates. So sang one half of the choir, calling upon the gates to throw themselves wide open to their full height, that free entrance might he given to the approaching sacred fabric. And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors. Pleonastic, But giving the emphasis of repetition, and adding the epithet \"everlasting,\" because the tabernacle was viewed as about to be continued in the temple, and the temple was designed to be God's house \"for ever\" (1 Kings 8:13). And the King of glory shall come in. God was regarded as dwelling between the cherubim on the mercy-seat, where the Shechinah from time to time made its appearance. The entrance of the ark into the tabernacle was thus the \"coming in of the King of glory.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Who is this King of glory? The other half of the choir, acting as keepers of the doors, inquires, as if ignorant of the motive and character of the procession, \"Who is this King of glory?\" - who is it to whom ye give this high-sounding appellation, and to whom ye require us to open? And the reply follows from the previous speakers. The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. It is Jehovah, the Strong and Mighty One-strong in himself, mighty in his acts, mighty especially in battle; whom ye may therefore be glad to receive among you as your Defence. It is this King for whom we demand admission.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. A repetition of ver. 7, the first part of the choir reiterating its challenge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Who is this King of glory? The second part of the choir reiterates its question, as though not yet quite understanding. \"Who is he, this King of glory?\" and the first, slightly varying its answer, replies, The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. The epithet, \"Lord of hosts\" well known at the time (1 Samuel 1:11; 2 Samuel 5:10; 2 Samuel 6:2; 2 Samuel 7:18, 26, 27, etc.), made all clear, and, the gates being thrown open, the ark was brought in, and set in its place in the midst of the tabernacle (2 Samuel 6:17). It has been generally recognized that the reception of the ark into the tabernacle on Mount Zion typified the entrance of our Lord into heaven after his ascension, whence our Church appoints this psalm as one of those to be recited on Ascension Day.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift; up my soul (comp.

The prayer passes from the particular to the universal. What David desires for himself he desires also for all the true servants of God - all who wait on him, look to him, seek for indications of his will (comp. Psalm 123:2). Let them he ashamed which transgress without cause. Let shame be the portion, not of thy servants, but of thy adversaries - of those who transgress (or rebel) without reasonable cause. Such persons deserve to be brought to shame.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Show me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths. An echo of the prayer of Moses when his people were rebellious at Sinai (Exodus 33:13), reiterated by David in Psalm 27:11, and perhaps again in Psalm 86:11 (see also Psalm 119:33). Man is so wanting in spiritual understanding, so morally blind and ignorant, that, unless enlightened from on high, he cannot discern aright the \"way of godliness;\" he does not know at any given moment what God would have him to do. Hence it is the constant prayer of every religious man that God will \"lighten his darkness;\" \"make his way plain before his face;\" \"show him the path that he should walk in;\" enable him to see, if no more, at any rate the next step which it is his duty to take. The idea has been beautifully expressed by a modern poet -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloomNEWLINELead thou me on.NEWLINEThe night is dark, and I am far from homo;NEWLINELead thou me on.NEWLINEKeep thou my feet; I do not ask to seeNEWLINEThe distant scene; one step enough for me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Lead me in thy truth, and teach me. \"Thy truth\" would seem to mean here \"the true, right path\" - the \"way of godliness.\" The prayer is that God will both teach this to the psalmist and \"lead him in it\" - cause him, i.e., to walk in it, and never stray from it, so long as he lives. For thou art the God of my salvation. Thou art the God from whom alone I obtain salvation, and to whom alone, therefore, I am bound to pray for everything on which salvation depends - as, for instance, light and guidance. On thee do I wait all the day. In prayer for these blessings, I wait on thee all the day long.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy loving-kindnesses. Past mercies form a ground for the expectation of future blessings. God's character cannot change; his action as one time will always be consistent and harmonious with his action at another. If he has been kind and merciful to David in the past, David may count on his continuing the same in the future. For they have been ever of old. Not lately only, or to David only, have his mercies been shown, but through all past time, to all his servants, from of old.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions. Job thought that God counted against him the \"iniquities of his youth\" (Job 13:26); David, with greater faith and a deeper insight into the true character of God, can ask with confidence that his may not be reckoned against him. An earthly father does not remember them against his son. How much less will our heavenly Father! According to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord! Still, put me not from thy mind. \"Remember thou me\" always - but in the light of thy tender mercy, with the rays of thy love streaming over me and hiding the deformities of my transgressions. Do this \"for thy goodness' sake,\" i.e. because thou art essential Goodness, perfect Tenderness, perfect Love.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGood and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Good and upright is the Lord. A transition. From prayer the psalmist turns to reflection, and meditates awhile (vers. 8-10) on the character and ways of God. God is, indeed, \"good,\" as he has implied in the preceding verse - i.e., kind, tender, gentle, merciful; but he is also \"upright\" (יָשָׁר) - just, straight, strict, undeviating from the path of right. As Bishop Butler observes, \"Divine goodness, with which, if I mistake not, we make very free in our speculations, may not be a bare single disposition to produce happiness, but a disposition to make the good, the faithful, the honest man happy\" ('Anal.,' 1:2, p. 41) - s disposition, i.e., to be just as well as merciful to distribute happiness by the canon of right. Therefore will he teach sinners in the way. He will not abandon sinners - this is his \"goodness;\" but will reclaim them, chasten them, make them to walk in his way - this is his uprightness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The meek will he guide in judgment. It is only such sinners as are \"meek\" - i.e.. humble, submissive, contrite, teachable - that God will take in hand and teach. The proud and perverse he will leave to their own devices, but the meek he will guide in the paths of righteousness, and the meek will he teach his way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. Mercy and truth will meet together (Psalm 85:10) in the case of those who, however they may have sinned, meekly submit themselves to God's guidance, and thenceforth keep his covenant and his testimonies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For thy Name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity. The psalmist here resumes the attitude of prayer, which he had laid aside in ver. 8. The\" sins of his youth,\" and his other \"transgressions,\" which he had asked God to forget (ver. 7), rankle in his own memory, and force him to cry out again and again for pardon (see ver. 18; Psalm 32:5; Psalm 38:18; Psalm 39:8; Psalm 41:4, etc.). Here he beseeches God to pardon him \"for his Name's sake,\" i.e. for the honour of his Name, that his mercy may Be known far and wide, and his goodness cause all the world to praise him. He enforces his plea by the confession, For it (i.e. his iniquity) is great; so great, that his need of forgiveness is excessive: so great, that to forgive it will be truly Godlike; so great, that, unless forgiven, he must be lost. (For his \"great sin,\" see 2 Samuel 11:4-17.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - What man is he that feareth the Lord? Once more we have a series of reflections (vers. 12-15) - first, with respect to the God-fearing man. Every such man shall have favour shown him by God - him shall he (i.e. God) teach in the way that he shall choose. This is, of course, the right way - the way of God's commandments (Psalm 119:30, 173). God shall make his way plain to the God-fearing man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - His soul shall dwell at case; rather, his soul shall dwell in bliss; i.e. he shall enjoy, while on earth, blessings of every kind. And his seed shall inherit the earth. His posterity after him shall be continued upon the earth, and shall prosper (comp. Psalm 37:11, 22, 29). There is a tendency in righteousness to \"inherit the earth,\" only held in check by accidental and (it may be) temporary circumstances (see Butler's' Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 3, pp. 78, 79).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him. God favours those who fear him with secret and confidential communion (comp. Proverbs 3:32). He \"comes unto them, and makes his abode with them\" (John 14:23), and \"teaches them\" (John 14:26), and enlightens them, and leads them in his way, and learns them (ver. 5), and \"seals their instruction\" (Job 33:16). And he will show them his covenant; i.e. make them see the full force of it, since his \"commandment is exceeding broad\" (Psalm 119:96).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord. David is always looking to God (Psalm 141:8), waiting for him (Psalm 40:1; Psalm 62:1, 5; Psalm 69:3, etc.), expecting his providences, anticipating his deliverances (Psalm 3:7; Psalm 5:11; Psalm 7:1; Psalm 9:3, etc.). He is now, apparently, in some danger or difficulty, and in need of the Divine succour (comp. ver. 2). For he shall pluck my feet out of the net (comp. Psalm 9:15; Psalm 10:10; Psalm 31:5; Psalm 35:7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me. The approach of peril is regarded as a sign that God has \"turned away his face.\" He is besought, therefore, to turn towards one who needs his aid. For I am desolate and afflicted (comp. vers. 17, 18). The affliction evidently comes from enemies, either foreign or domestic (vers. 2, 19); but its nature is not further indicated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses. Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins. The affliction, of whatever kind it may have been, was regarded by David as a punishment sent on him for his sins. Of his sins he was at this time deeply conscious (vers. 7, 11) and deeply repentant. Probably they included his great sin (see the comment on ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConsider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Consider nine enemies; for they are many (comp.

Rather an integrity and uprightness whereto he hopes to attain, by the grace of God, in days to come - an integrity and uprightness for which he \"waits\" For I wait on thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm25:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRedeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles. It is supposed by some that this verse was added during the \"trouble\" of the Captivity; and certainly its stand-lug outside the alphabetical arrangement favours this view; but the similar irregularity at the close of Psalm 34, rather makes against it. David evidently was not a slave to a mechanical arrangement; and any pious Israelite, at any age (therefore certainly David) might naturally append a prayer for his people to an outpouring of prayer for himself. Moreover, redemption is an idea familiar to David (Psalm 19:14; Psalm 26:11; Psalm 31:5; Psalm 34:22).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity. It seems to Christians a bold act to call on God for judgment, but the saints of the earlier dispensation, having, perhaps, a less keen sense of human imperfection, were wont to do so. It is Job's cry from his first utterance until his \"words are ended;\" and here we find David taking it up and re-echoing it. Man longs to hear the sentence of acquittal from the great Judge. Like Job, David asserts his \"integrity,\" and in the same qualified sense. He is sincere in his endeavours to do right. Yet still he needs mercy and redemption (see ver. 11). I have trusted also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide. (comp. Psalm 18:36; Psalm 37:31). David is confident of his past; for the future he trusts in God to uphold his steps, and save him from slips and falls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExamine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Examine me, O Lord, and prove me. He desires to be examined and proved - tested, as a metal is tested (comp. Psalm 17:3) - that his sincerity may fully appear. Try my reins and my heart; i.e. my emotional and my intellectual natures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes. The psalmist now enters upon an enumeration of the points of conduct on which his confidence in his integrity rests. They are six - three positive and three negative. First of all, he keeps God's loving-kindness, or mercy (חֶסֶד), ever before his eyes - reflects on it, meditates on it, presents it to his thought - continually. And I have walked in thy truth. Secondly, he walks - he has always walked - in God s truth. God's Law is the truth (Psalm 119:42); and walking in God's truth is walking in the Law which he has given to men; as Hitzig, Maurer, and others have seen. Hengstenberg's exposition, \"I have constantly thought upon thy faithfulness,\" cannot be admitted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I have not sat with vain persons. Thirdly, he has not sat with vain persons; literally, with men of vanity; i.e. he has not consorted (Psalm 1:1) with light and frivolous persons - those whose hearts are set upon vain and worthless things (see Psalm 24:4, and the comment). Neither will I go in with dissemblers. Nor will he go in with (nor has he, we may conclude, gone in with) dissemblers, i.e. hypocrites. He has neither thrown in his lot with the light, vain persons who make no pretence to religion, nor with the pretenders, who \"have the form of godliness, but deny the power thereof\" (2 Timothy 3:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I have hated the congregation of evil-doers. Fifthly, he has hated, and hates, with a holy and strong abhorrence (comp. Psalm 139:22), the congregation of evil-deers - the gatherings and assemblies of those who meet only for wicked purposes - to sin themselves, and to draw others into like evil courses. This is a positive trait of a very marked character, and goes far beyond the explanation which has been given of it: \"I take no part in assemblies for the ruin of others\" (Hengstenberg). Sixthly and lastly, he will not sit with the wicked. This only goes beyond the declarations in ver. 4 by extending to all wicked persons of every kind the avoidance there limited to \"vain persons,\" and \"dissemblers.\" The spirit is that indicated by Jacob in Genesis 49:6; by St. Paul, in 1 Corinthians 5:9-11 and Ephesians 5:7, 11; and by St. John, on the celebrated occasion when he avoided contact with Cerinthus (Iren., 3:3, § 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will wash mine hands in innoceney; so will I compass thine altar, O Lord. This seems to be the key-note of the psalm. If not a necessary, it is at any rate a probable, exegesis, that David composed this psalm on an occasion when he was about to offer a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to God for some mercy recently vouchsafed him (ver. 7). Before offering, he feels the necessity of doing spiritually that which the priest' who officiated would have to do ceremonially (Exodus 30:17-21) - to \"wash his hands in innocency, and so to go to God's altar.\" His self-justification from ver. 1 to ver. 5 has had for its object to clear him from guilt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving; rather, to sound forth the voice of thanksgiving (Kay); or, to make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard (Revised Version). And tell of all thy wondrous works; or, recount them, enumerate them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house; i.e. \"the home that thy house affords me.\" It has been my delight to remain there, to pass long hours there, as it were to dwell there (comp. Psalm 23:6; Psalm 27:4; Psalm 63:2). And the place where thine honour dwelleth; literally, the place of the tabernacling of thy glory - the place where thy glory - the Shechinah - is enshrined and abides.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Gather not my soul with sinners. Unite me not in one doom with open sinners - those with whom I have always refused to consort (vers. 4, 5) - whose congregation I have \"hated.\" \"That the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" (Genesis 18:25). Nor my life with bloody men. Bloody men - literally, men of bloods - are the worst of wicked men, cut-throats, assassins, murderers. At any rate, put me not on a par with them. Little, probably, did the psalmist think at this time how soon he was to become, practically, a murderer, and to \"slay Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the children of Ammon\" (2 Samuel 12:9)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In whose hands is mischief; i.e. who are always occupied with some mischief or other - always engaged in carrying out wicked devices (see Proverbs 12:2; Proverbs 14:17). And their right hand is full of bribes. Which they have taken to condemn the innocent (comp. Psalm 15:5; Isaiah 1:23; Jeremiah 22:17, Ezekiel 22:12; Hosea 4:10; Micah 3:11, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; i.e. I will continue to walk as I have walked hitherto (see ver. 1) - I will be \"integer vitae scelerisque purus\" - a brave and good resolve. Had he but kept to it! Redeem me, and be merciful unto me (compare the comment on ver. 1). Though hitherto he has walked innocently, and is resolved still to continue to walk innocently; he nevertheless feels that he has need of redeeming mercy. Though he \"knows nothing by himself, yet he is not thereby justified\" (1 Corinthians 4:4). Many, doubtless, are his \"secret sins,\" which God has \"set in the light of his countenance\" (Psalm 90:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - My foot standeth in an even place; or, on level ground - where there is nothing to cause me to stumble (comp. Psalm 27:11). In the congregations will I bless the Lord; i.e. in the assemblies of the people for public worship. David constantly acknowledges this duty (Psalm 22:22, 25: 27:6; 35:18; 40:9, 10; 68:26, etc.). Indeed, it is the general idea that underlies all his psalms of praise, since they wore composed to be recited in the congregation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord is my Light (comp. John 1:7-9; John 12:35, 36, 46; 1 John 1:5). The statement does not occur in any other place in the Old Testament, though the idea may be found in Isaiah 60:1, 20; Micah 7:8; and elsewhere. Light has been well called \"this profoundly beautiful name of God\" (Delitzsch). And my Salvation (comp. Psalm 18:2; Psalm 62:2, 6). Whom shall I fear? \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\" (Romans 8:31). Who can be to be feared? (see Psalm 118:6). Not man certainly; for\" what can man do unto us?\" Not other gods; for they are nonentities. Not devils; for they can do nothing but by God's permission. The Lord is the Strength of my life; literally, the stronghold (comp. Psalm 28:8; Psalm 31:4; Psalm 71:2; Psalm 144:2). Of whom shall I be afraid? The question is superfluous, but is repeated to complete the balance of the clauses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. A special occasion seems to be intended, so that the LXX. have rightly, ἠσθένησαν καὶ ἔπεσαν. Some unrecorded event in the war with Absalom before the final struggle, is probably alluded to. There is an emphasis on \"mine enemies,\" which implies that the adversaries were not the foes of the country, but David's personal foes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. In the first burst of joy at his recent victory, the 'host\" which remains unconquered seems of light account - let them advance - let them \"encamp against him\" - his heart will not be afraid; but when the joy has had full vent, there is a reaction; the enemies then appear more formidable, and God's aid is besought against them (see vers. 9-12). Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. \"In this\" may be either \"in the fact that the Lord is my Light and my Salvation\" (ver. 1), or \"in case of such an event as war and attack on the part of the enemy.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after. A most emphatic introduction of the new topic! Amid all my joy and jubilation, there is still one thing which I need, which I entreat Jehovah to grant - that thing I shall continue to seek after until I obtain it, viz. that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. The psalmist is evidently debarred access to the sanctuary; he feels his exclusion from it a terrible privation; he longs to be there - to \"dwell\" there (comp. Psalm 26:8); to offer there \"sacrifices of joy\" (ver. 6); to sing there psalms of thanksgiving. He would fain also behold the beauty of the Lord - τὴν τερηνότητα, LXX. - \" all that is engaging and gracious in his revelation of himself\" (Kay); \"not the outward beauty of the sanctuary, but the gracious attributes which its ritual symbolized\" ('Speaker's Commentary'). And to inquire in his temple. It has already appeared, from Psalm 5:7, that the word \"temple\" or \"palace\" (heykal) was applied in David's time to the tabernacle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. This is not to be understood literally. David means that his spirit will find a refuge with God in times of trouble, not (as some Jewish expositors argue) that he will actually hide from his enemies inside the tabernacle. From such a sacrilege he would have shrunk. He shall set me up upon a rock (comp. Psalm 18:2; Psalm 61:2). The \"Rock\" is God himself, who is always David's final Refuge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me. A further and final triumph is confidently anticipated. God will complete his work. He will repulse the \"host\" by which David is about to be attacked (ver. 3), give him victory over it, bring him back from exile, and grant him once more free access to the sanctuary. Therefore, says the psalmist, will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; or, \"sacrifices of joyful sound,\" accompanied with singing and instrumental music (comp. Psalm 89:15). I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord (comp. Ephesians 5:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-14. - The strain now entirely changes. The rhythm alters from a jubilant double beat to a slow and mournful cadence. A cry is raised for mercy and pity - the wrath of God is deprecated - rejection and desertion are contemplated and prayed against (vers. 7-10). The danger from the enemy appears great and formidable (vers. 11, 12). With an effort of faith, the writer just saves himself from despair (ver. 14), and then, in brave words, braces himself up for further endurance. Verse 7. - Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. There is no \"when\" in the original. The clauses are short, and broken, \"Hear, O Lord; with my voice I call; pity me, and answer me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek. The order of the words in the original is as follows: \"To thee said my heart - Seek ye my face - thy face, Lord, will I seek.\" And the full meaning seems to he, \"To thee said my heart - Hast thou said unto men, Seek ye my face? I for one will obey thee - Thy face, Lord, will I seek.\" The command, \"Seek ye my face,\" had been given by David to the people on the day that he set up the ark upon Mount Zion (1 Chronicles 16:11). It was probably regarded as implied in Deuteronomy 4:29.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hide not thy face far from me. It would he useless for David to \"seek God's face,\" if God should determine to \"hide his face\" from him. David felt from time to time as if God's face was hidden from him, as we see in other psalms (Psalm 10:1; Psalm 13:1; Psalm 69:17, etc.); and so also did other saints (Psalm 44:24; Psalm 88:14). In most instances, probably, God sends the feeling as a chastisement, that the heart may turn with more sincerity to him. Put not thy servant away in anger; i.e. reject me not - cast me not off. The verb used is very strong and emphatic. Thou hast been my Help. Ever in the past I have had thee for Helper (comp. Psalm 3:3-7; Psalm 4:1; Psalm 6:8-10; Psalm 18:2, etc.). God's goodness to us in the past must ever be our chief ground of confidence in him for the future. Leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation (comp. Psalm 94:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. We are not to gather from this that David's father and mother had forsaken him. They were probably dead at the time of his flight from Absalom. What David means is that, even if forsaken by his nearest and dearest, he would not be forsaken by God. The expression is proverbial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTeach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Teach me thy way, O Lord (comp. Psalm 25:3, and the comment ad loc.). And lead me in a plain path; literally, a level path - a path traversing a fiat and smooth country, not one where the ground is rugged and beset with rocks and precipices. Because of mine enemies. David's enemies are ever at hand, to swallow him up (Psalm 56:2). If his way be not plain and smooth, it will be to their advantage and to his detriment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies; literally, the soul of mine enimies; i.e. their desire (see Psalm 35:25; Psalm 41:2), which was no doubt to capture him, and. bring him a prisoner to Jerusalem. For false witnesses are risen up against me. The party which attached itself to Absalom accused David of cruelty to the house of Saul (2 Samuel 16:8), and probably of other crimes and misdemeanours. Absalom himself accused him of a failure in his kingly duties (2 Samuel 15:8). And such as breathe out cruelty; or, violence. To \"breathe out\" violence, threats, slaughter, malice, etc., is a common metaphor in many languages (Acts 9:1; Aristoph., 'Eq.,' 1. 437; Her, 'Od.,' 4. 13, 1. 19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.

By an effort of faith, the psalmist saved himself from the despair which threatened to seize upon him, and assured himself that he would yet experience \"the goodness of the Lord\" in some merciful interposition and deliverance, while he still remained on earth, before he \"went whence he should not return - to the land of darkness and the shadow of death, a land of darkness as darkness itself, and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness\" (Job 10:21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Wait on the Lord. This is an exhortation, not to others, but to himself (comp. Psalm 62:5; and see also Psalm 42:5, 11; Psalm 43:5). His stronger self exhorts his weaker self not to despair, but to wait upon God - to tarry, i.e., the Lord's leisure - and, meanwhile to be of good courage; or, be strong (comp. Deuteronomy 31:6; Joshua 1:6; 1 Chronicles 22:13), as the phrase is elsewhere generally translated. \"Be strong,\" he says to himself, and he (i.e. God) shall strengthen thine heart. \"Aide-tot, le ciel l'aidera.\" Make an effort to be strong, and the strength will be given thee, as thou makest it. Then in this strength, thus given, continue till waiting - Wait, I say, on the Lord.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my Rock; be not silent to me; rather, as in the Revised Version, to thee, O Lord, will I call; my Rock, be not thou deaf unto me. \"My Rock\" belongs to the second clause. It is with David, in these early psalms, an epitheton usilatum (comp. Psalm 18:2; Psalm 27:5; Psalm 31:2, 3; Psalm 40:3; Psalm 61:2; Psalm 62:2, etc.). The Hebrew term used is sometimes taut, sometimes sela, which call to our minds the two great rook-fortresses of Tyre and Petra.

God is said to hear prayer when he grants it, to be deaf to prayer when he withholds the boon requested. The use of the expressions \"voice\" and \"cry\" marks the earnestness of the prayers offered. When I lift up my hands, The usual attitude of a Hebrew in prayer (see Exodus 9:29; Exodus 17:11, 12; 1 Kings 8:22, 54; Psalm 63:4; Psalm 141:2; Lamentations 2:19; Lamentations 3:41). Originally, the idea probably was that the hands should be ready to receive the blessings which God would bestow. But, later on, the lifting up of the hands seems to have been regarded as symbolizing the lifting up of the heart (Lamentations 3:41).

The psalmist prays that he may not share the fate of the workers of iniquity, over whom he seems to see some terrible judgment impending. Which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts. (For extreme instances of this kind of wickedness, see 2 Samuel 3:27; 2 Samuel 20:9, 10; and for the wide prevalence of such treacherous dealing, comp.

The feeling of righteous indignation, naturally implanted in us, causes us to desire the punishment of the wicked, quite apart from any wrong that they may have done to ourselves (Aristotle, 'Rhet.,' 2:1, § 3). Give them after the work of their hands: render to them their desert. Nothing satisfies our moral feelings but exact retribution - Αἴκε τάθοι τάκ ἔρεξε, δίκη η ἰθεῖα γένοιτο.

They do not note God's providential workings. If they did, they would see that judgment falls upon the wicked, and, seeing this, they would fear and abstain from evil. But they take no notice - God is not in all their thoughts.

The cause of the change would seem to have been a confident assurance, arising out of the very act of prayer, that the prayer is heard and granted, so that the happy results prayed for are certain to follow. Such an assurance is certainly not attained by all those whose supplications are earnest and devout; but David appears to have enjoyed it not infrequently (see above, Psalm 6:8-10; Psalm 7:17, etc.).

My heart trusted in him, and I am helped. As far as feeling goes, David is already \"helped.\" He feels himself delivered out of his peril. Therefore, he says, my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song - literally, out of my song, which is explained to mean \"out of my store of song\" - will I praise him.

The welfare of David and that of the people are bound up together. God strengthens him for their sakes, that he may guide them aright and fight their battles, and give them dominion over their enemies. It was with this object that he chose him out of all Israel, and took him from the sheepfolds, and had him anointed king - that he might \"feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance\" (Psalm 78:71).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Save thy people, and bless thins inheritance. \"In conclusion, the psalmist prays that the Lord would do eternally that which he had done now\" (Hengstenberg) - \"save\" and \"bless\" his people - keep them from evil, and give them all that is good. Feed them also. As a shepherd does his flock (comp. Psalm 23:1, 2, Isaiah 40:11). And lift them up for ever. Some explain the\" lifting up\" as carrying in his arms over rough places - a prolongation of the shepherd metaphor (Kay; 'Speaker's Commentary'); but, perhaps, the more ordinary meaning of the Hebrew word - \"exalt,\" \"lift up on high,\" \"raise above others\" - which is preferred by Bishop Horsley, Rosenmuller, and Hengstenberg, is intended.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty; literally, ye sons of the mighty. It is disputed who are meant. Most commentators suggest the holy angels (Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary,' ' Four Friends,' Professor Alexander, Cheyne, etc.); but some think the heathen (Michaelis, Kay); and others, the mighty ones of the earth generally (Koster), to be meant. Give unto the Lord glory and strength; i.e. praise his Name, ascribe to him glory and strength and every other excellency.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name (comp. Psalm 96:8); literally, the glory of his Name; i.e. the glory properly belonging to it. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness (comp. Psalm 96:9). This is generally explained as an exhortation to worship God in beautiful vestments, or with all the accessories of a beautiful ceremonial; but Dr. Alexander rightly questions whether the Beauty inherent in holiness itself is not meant. The apostle speaks of \"the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit\" (1 Peter 3:4). And in goodness and holiness of every kind there is a sweetness and grace which may well be called \"beauty,\" seeing that it has a close analogy with the beautiful in external nature and in art. The Greeks expressed physical beauty and moral perfection by one and the same term - τὸ καλόν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The voice of the Lord is upon the waters. The description of God's might in the thunderstorm now begins with one of the sudden transitions which David loves. \"The voice of the Lord\" - already identified with the thunder in Psalm 18:13 - is suddenly heard muttering in the height of heaven, \"upon the waters;\" i.e. the waters stored in the clouds that float on high in the air. The God of glory - the God set forth in vers. 1, 2 - thundereth. It is he himself, according to the psalmist, no minor agent. The Lord (Jehovah) is upon the many (or, great) waters (comp. Job 37:2-5 and Psalm 18:7-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The voice of the Lord is powerful; literally, in power, or with power (LXX., ἐν ἰσχύι'). The voice of the Lord is full of majesty; literally, in majesty, or with majesty. Two somewhat distant crashes, each louder than the preceding one, are thought to be represented - the storm sweeping on, and gradually drawing nearer and more near.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars. At length down swoops the hurricane - wind and rain and forked flashes of lightning all blended together, and violently tearing through the forest. The tall cedars - the pride and glory of Syria and Palestine - are snapped like reeds, and fall in a tangled mass. The Lord, who erstwhile \"planted them\" (Psalm cir. 16), now breaketh the cedars of Lebanon - breaketh and destroyeth them in his fury. Such storms, though rare in Palestine and Syria, are sometimes witnessed; and descriptions have been given by travellers which bear out this one of David (comp. Wilson, 'Travels,' p. 146; Cunningham Geikie, vol. 2. pp. 57, 335; Tristram, 'Land. of Israel,' pp. 40, 194, 227, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He maketh them also to skip like a calf (comp. Psalm 18:7). As the thunder crashes and rolls and reverberates among the mountains, it seems as though the mountains themselves shook, and were moved from their places. This is expressed with extreme vividness, though no doubt with truly Oriental hyperbole, in the present passage. Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn; rather, like a young wild ox. Lebanon and Sirion, or Hermon (Deuteronomy 3:9), are the two principal mountains of Palestine, Hermon being visible throughout almost the whole extent of the Holy Land, and Lebanon enjoying a commanding position beyond Galilee to the north. The storm which shook these lofty mountain-tracts would indeed be a manifestation of power,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire; rather, the voice of the Lord heweth out flames of fire. The poet describes the appearances of things, not the actual reality. To him it seems as if the thunder, rolling along the sky, hewed out a chasm in the clouds, from which the forked lightning issued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness; yea, the Lord shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. Kadesh seems to be mentioned as lying at the opposite extremity of Palestine from Lebanon and Hermon, so that the storm is made, by a magnificent hyperbole, to extend over the entire Holy Land, from the far north to the extreme south, and to embrace at once the lofty mountain-chains which are rather Syrian than Palestinian, the hills and valleys of Palestine proper, and the arid region of the south where Judaea merges into Arabia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve. Plutarch says, \"Shepherds accustom their flocks in a thunderstorm to keep together, and put their heads in the same direction; for such as are left alone and separated from the rest through terror cast their young\" ('Sympos.,' Quest. 2.). And Pliny, \"Solitary sheep cast their lambs in thunderstorms; the remedy is to keep the flock together, since it helps them to have company.\" A traveller in South Africa observes, \"In Bechuanaland, when there are heavy thunderstorms, the antelopes flee in consternation; and the poor Bechuanas start off on the morning following such a storm in quest of the young which have been cast through horror\" (see Moffat's 'South Africa,' quoted by Dr. Kay, in his 'Commentary on the Psalms,' p. 93). And discovereth the forests; or, strippeth the forests. Denudes them of their leaves and branches. And in his temple doth every one speak of his glory; i.e. his grand temple, or palace (heykal), of heaven and earth. In this temple \"every one,\" or rather everything, all that is in it. is continually speaking of his glory (literally, \"says, Glory!\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord sitteth upon the flood. Most moderns translate, \"The Lord sat (as King) at the Flood,\" and understand by \"the Flood\" the great Noachian Deluge (Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Revised Version). Some, however, regard this as a forced and unnatural interpretation (Bishop Horsley, ' Four Friends,' 'Speaker's Commentary'), and think the flood accompanying the storm just described (vers. S - 9), or floods and inundations generally, to be meant. It is difficult to decide between the two interpretations. Yea, the Lord sitteth King for ever. As God has sat as King in the past, whether at the great Deluge or at any other flood or floods, so will he ever \"sit as King\" in the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord will give strength unto his people. The Lord, who shows his strength in the thunderstorm, will be able, and assuredly will be willing, to \"give strength to his people\" - to impart to them some of that power and might which he so abundantly possesses. Then they, partaking in his strength, need not fear the attacks of any adversaries. Struggle and contention will, by his good providence, be one day brought to an end; and ultimately the Lord will bless his people with peace - will give them the \"rest which remaineth to the people of God\" (Hebrews 3:9), the perfect peace which \"passeth all understanding\" (Philippians 4:7).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Why do the heathen rage? The psalmist writes with a vision before his eyes. He \"sees Jehovah upon his throne, and Messiah entering upon his universal dominion. The enemies of both on earth rise up against them with frantic tumult, and vainly strive to east off the fetters of their rule.\" Hence his sudden outburst. \"What ails the heathen (goim),\" he says. \"that they rage?\" or \"make an uproar\" (Kay), or \"assemble tumultuously\" (margin of Authorized Version and Revised,Version)? What are they about? What do they design? And why do the people - rather, the peoples, or \"the masses\" (Kay) - imagine (or, meditate) a vain thing? It must be \"a vain thing;\" i.e. a purpose which will come to naught, if it is something opposed to the will of Jehovah and Messiah. The vision shows the psalmist Jew and Gentile banded together against the gospel of Christ. Its scope is not exhausted by the exposition of Acts 4:26, but extends to the whole struggle between Christianity on the one hand, and Judaism and paganism on the other. \"The peoples\" still to this day \"imagine a vain thing\" - imagine that Christianity will succumb to the assaults made upon it - will fade, die away, and disappear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The kings of the earth set themselves; or, draw themselves up in array (comp. Jeremiah 46:4). Such kings as Herod the Great, Herod Agrippa, Nero, Galerius, Diocletian, Julian the Apostate, etc. There is always a warfare between the world and the Church, in which kings are apt to take a part, most often on the worldly side. And the rulers take counsel together. \"Rulers\" are persons having authority, but below the rank of kings Such were the ethnarchs and tetrarchs of the first century, the governors of provinces under the Roman emperor, the members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, and the like. These last frequently \"took counsel against the Lord\" (see Matthew 26:3 - 5; Matthew 27:1; Acts 4:5, 6; Acts 5:21-41). Against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying. In David's time the recognized \"anointed of the Lord\" was the divinely appointed King of Israel (1 Samuel 2:10; 1 Samuel 12:3, 5; 1 Samuel 16:6; 1 Samuel 24:6, 10; 1 Samuel 26:7, 16; 2 Samuel 1:14, 16: 19:21; 22:51; Psalm 17:50; 20:6; 28:8) - first Saul, and then David; but David here seems to designate by the term a Greater than himself - the true theocratic King, whom he typified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Let us break their bands asunder. Wicked men always feel God's rule and his Law to be restraints. They chafe at them, fret against them, and, in the last resort - so far as their will goes - wholly throw them off. And cast away their cords from us. \"Bands\" and \"cords\" are the fetters that restrain prisoners. The rebels determine to burst them, and assert their absolute freedom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh. God \"laughs\" at the vain and futile efforts of man to escape from the control of his laws and throw off his dominion (comp. Psalm 37:13; Psalm 59:8). It is impossible that these efforts should succeed. Men must obey God willingly, or else unwillingly. The Lord (Adonay in the ordinary Hebrew text, but a large number of manuscripts have Jehovah) shall have them in derision. \"Laughter\" and \"derision\" are, of course, anthropo-morphisms. It is meant that God views with contempt and scorn man's weak attempts at rebellion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath. \"Then\" (אָז) means \"after a time\" - \"presently\" ('Speaker's Commentary'), when the fitting period has arrived. \"He shall speak\" - not in articulate words, not by a voice from heaven, not even by a commissioned messenger, but by accomplished facts. Christ does rule; Christ does reign; he sits a King in heaven, and is acknowledged as a King upon earth. In vain was all the opposition of the Jews, in vain persecution after persecution by the Gentiles. God has established his Church, and \"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\" And vex them. \"Strike terror and dismay into them\" (Kay). In his sore displeasure; or, \"in the heat of his anger\" (Trench and Skinner).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion; literally, and as for me, I have set my King upon Zion, the mount of my holiness. The words are uttered by Jehovah, and must refer to the Anointed One of ver. 2. This Anointed One God has set up as King upon Zion, his holy mountain. Without denying some reference to David, the type, we must regard the Anti-type, Christ, as mainly pointed at. Christ is set up for ever as King in the heavenly Jerusalem (Revelation 21:2-7; Revelation 22:1 5). There is no need to substitute \"anointed\" for \"set\" or\" set up,\" as is done by Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Ewald, Zuuz, Umbreit, and others, since גסך has both meanings (comp. Proverbs 8:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will declare the decree. It is best to suppose that Messiah here takes the word, and maintains it to the end of ver. 9, when the psalmist resumes in his own person. Messiah \"declares,\" or publishes, a \"decree,\" made by God the Father in the beginning of all things, and communicated by him to the Son, whereby he made known the relationship between them, and invested the Son with sovereign power over the universe. The Lord hath said unto me; rather, said unto me (see the Revised Version). It was said, once for all, at a distant date. Thou art my Son. Not \"one of my sons,,' but \"my Son;\" i.e. my one Son, my only one - \"my Son\" κατ ἐξοχήν (comp. Psalm 89:27; Hebrews 1:5). This day have I begotten thee. If it be asked, \"Which day?\" the answer would seem to be, the day when Christ commenced his redemptive work: then the Father \"committed all judgment\" - \"all dominion over creation\" to the Son\" (John 5:22), gave him, as it were, a new existence, a new sphere, the throne of the world, and of all that is or that ever will be, in it (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' ad loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAsk of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance. A very small part of the heathen were the inheritance of David, and therefore the Messiah only can be spoken of in this verse. Before Messiah \"all kings\" were to \"fall down; all nations to do him service\" (Psalm 72:11; comp. Isaiah 49:22; Isaiah 60:3, 4; Matthew 28:19, etc.). And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession (comp. Isaiah 52:10; Jeremiah 16:19; Micah 5:4; Zechariah 9:10; Acts 13:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron. It is said that these words, and those of the next clause, \"cannot describe the mild rule of Christ\" (Rosenmuller, Do Wette, Hupfeld, etc.). But the objectors forget that there is a severe, as well as a mild, side to the dealings of God with his human creatures. St. Paul notes in the same verse both the \"severity\" and the \"goodness\" of God (Romans 11:22). Christ, though \"the Prince of Peace,\" \"came to send a sword upon the earth\" (Matthew 10:34). As the appointed Judge of men, he takes vengeance on the wicked, while he rewards the righteous (Luke 3:17; Matthew 25:46). Nay, St. John, in the Apocalypse, declares that \"out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations. and \"ye shall rule them with a rod of iron\" (Revelation 19:15; comp. 2:27; 12:5). So, with respect to the other clause of the verse - Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel - it is to be noted that there is a similar threat made by the Lord of hosts against Jerusalem in the Book of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 19:11), and that under the new covenant the same is threatened in the Revelation (Revelation 2:27). In truth, both covenants are alike in denouncing the extreme of God's wrath on impenitent sinners, such as those here spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Be wise now therefore, O ye kings. The remainder of the psalm contains the advice of the psalmist to the rebels of vers. 1-3, and to all who may be inclined to imitate them. \"Be wise,\" he says,\" be prudent. For your own sakes desist from attempts at rebellion. Jehovah and Messiah are irresistible. Ye will find it \"hard to kick against the pricks.'\" Be instructed, ye judges of the earth. \"Be taught,\" i.e., \"by experience, if ye are not wise enough to know beforehand, that opposition to God is futile.\" Compare the advice of Gamaliel (Acts 5:38, 39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTServe the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Serve the Lord with fear. \"If ye will not serve him (i.e. honour and obey him) from love, do it from fear;\" \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\" (Psalm 111:10). And rejoice. Do not be content with fear. Go on from fear to love, and so to joy. Good men \"rejoice in God alway\" (Philippians 4:4). But such rejoicing must be with trembling; or, with reverence (Prayer-book Version), since no service is acceptable to God but such as is rendered \"with reverence and godly fear\" (Hebrews 12:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Kiss the Son. It is certainly remarkable that we have here a different word for \"Son\" from that employed in ver. 7, and ordinarily in the Hebrew Bible. Still, there is other evidence that the word here used, bar, existed in the Hebrew no less than in the Aramaic, viz. Proverbs 31:2, where it is repeated thrice. It was probably an archaic and poetic word, like our \"sire\" for \"father,\" rarely used, but, when used, intended to mark some special dignity. Hengstenberg suggests that the writer's motive in prefering bar to ben in this place was to avoid the cacophony which would have arisen from the juxtaposition of ben and pen (פן); and this is quite possible, but as a secondary rather than as the main reason. By \"kiss the Son\" we must understand \"pay him homage,\" salute him as King in the customary way (see 1 Samuel 10:1). Lest he be angry. The omission of a customary token of respect is an insult which naturally augers the object of it (Esther 3:5). And ye perish from the way; or, as to the way.\" To anger the Son is to bring destruction on our \"way,\" or course in life. When his wrath is kindled but a little; rather, for soon his wrath may be kindled (see the Revised Version). Blessed are all they that put their trust in him. The writer ends with words of blessing, to relieve the general severity of the psalm (comp. Psalm 3:8; Psalm 5:12; Psalm 28:9; Psalm 41:13, etc.). (On the blessedness of trusting in God, see Psalm 34:8; Psalm 40:4; Psalm 84:12, etc.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.30":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I will extol thee, O Lord; or, \"I will exalt thee,\" as the word is rendered in Psalm 34:3; Psalm 99:5, 9; and elsewhere. For thou hast lifted me up; or, \"drawn me up,\" as a bucket is drawn up out of a well, or a man out of a dungeon. And hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. David had still enemies at the time of his numbering the people, as appears from 2 Samuel 24:13. Indeed, it was doubtless with some reference to the number of his foes that he wished to know how many followers he could rally to his standard in case of need. If the plague had continued much longer, David's military strength would have been seriously crippled, and his foes would have rejoiced with reason.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me. \"Heal\" may be used metaphorically for the removal of mental sufferings (see Psalm 41:4; Psalm 147:3); but David's grief when he saw the sufferings of his people from the plague seems to have wholly prostrated him, both in mind and body. For the nature of the \"cry\" spoken of, comp. vers. 8-10, which are an expansion of the present verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave; i.e. when I was on the verge of the grave, just ready to depart to the unseen world, thy interposition saved me, and brought me, as it were, back to life. Thou hast kept me alive. Lest the hyperbole of the preceding clause should be misunderstood, the writer appends a prosaic account of what had happened. God had \"kept him alive\" when he was in peril of death, and saved him, that he should not go down to the pit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Sing unto the Lord, O ye saints of his. David continually calls upon the people to join him in his praises of God. Even when the mercy vouchsafed has been granted specially to himself, he regards the people as interested, since he is their ruler in peace and their leader in war (see Psalm 9:11; Psalm 34:3, etc.). On the present occasion, however, the people who had escaped the pestilence had almost exactly the same reason for praising and thanking God that David had, and were bound to join him in his thanksgiving service. And give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness; literally, give thanks to the memorial of his holiness, which is explained, by reference to Exodus 3:15, as meaning, \"Give thanks to his holy Name\" (comp. Psalm 103:1; Psalm 106:47; Psalm 145:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life; literally, for a moment (is passed) in his anger, a lifetime in his favour. God s anger is short-lived in the case of those who, having sinned, repent, and confess their sin, and pray for mercy (see vers. 8-10). His favour, on the contrary, is enduring; it continues all their life. Weeping may endure for a night; rather, at eventide weeping comes to lodge, or to pass the night; but joy cometh in the morning; or, but at morn joy arriveth (comp. Job 33:26; Isaiah 26:20; Isaiah 54:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-12. - Now begins the expanded account of the deliverance in respect of which the thanksgiving is offered. And first, with regard to the offence that had drawn down the Divine chastisement; it was an offence of the lips, springing from an evil temper in the heart. Verse 6. - And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved; rather, as in the Revised Version, and as for me, in my prosperity I said, etc. There is a marked pause, and introduction of a new subject in a new strophe. Prosperity had worked an ill effect on the psalmist, had made him self-confident and proud. He \"said in his heart,\" as the wicked man in Psalm 10:6, only in still stronger phrase, \"I shall not be moved;\" literally, I shall not be moved for ever. His heart was lifted up, and in the spirit of self-glorification he gave command for the numbering of the people. The result was the plague, and the death of seventy thousand of his subjects. Into these details he does not here enter. He is content to trace his sin to its bitter root of pride, and to glance at its punishment (ver. 7) and his repentance (vers. 8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Lord, by thy favour thou hast (rather, hadst) made my mountain to stand strong. It was thy favour which had given me the \"prosperity\" whereby I was exalted, and which I thought rooted in myself - which had made Zion strong, and enabled me to triumph over my enemies. But, lo! suddenly all was changed - Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. God turned his face away, declared himself angry with his servant (1 Chronicles 21:7-12), and sent the dreadful plague which in a single day destroyed seventy thousand lives. Then David, feeling that God's face was indeed turned from him, \"was troubled.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. -NEWLINENEWLINE1 cried to thee, O Lord; and unto thee I made supplication (comp. 2 Samuel 24:17; 1 Chronicles 21:17). The part of his prayer most honourable to David is not recorded by himself, but by the historians. He tells us of his secret wrestlings with God, his complaints and expostulations - his cries and pleadings as they remained in his memory; he passes over the desire to die for his people, which the historians put on record.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?

What advantage wilt thou derive from my death, if thou killest me, either by the plague, which may as well fasten upon me as upon any one else, or by the misery and mental strain of seeing my subjects, my innocent sheep, suffer? God has \"no pleasure in the death of him that dieth\" (Ezekiel 18:32), and certainly can obtain no profit from the destruction of any of his creatures. Shall the dust praise thee? (comp. Psalm 6:5; Psalm 88:10; Psalm 115:17; Isaiah 38:18). In death, so far as the power of death extends, there can be no action; the lips cease to move, and therefore cannot hymn God's praise - the \"dust\" is inanimate, and, while it remains dust, cannot speak. What the freed soul may do, the psalmist does not consider. Very little was known under the old dispensation concerning the intermediate state. Shall it declare thy truth? The dust certainly could not do this, unless revivified and formed into another living body.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my Helper (comp. Psalm 54:4; Hebrews 13:6). Here the psalmist's prayer, uttered in his distress, ends, and he proceeds to declare the result.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou hast turned (rather, thou turnedst) for me my mourning into dancing. Suddenly, in a moment, all was changed. The angel ceased to slay. God bade him hold his hand. The Prophet Gad was sent with the joyful news to David, and commanded him at once to build an altar at Jehovah. Then the mourning ceased, and a joyful ceremonial was instituted, of which dancing, as so often, formed a part (see Exodus 15:20; 1 Samuel 18:6; 2 Samuel 6:14-16; Psalm 149:3; Jeremiah 31:4). Thou hast put off (rather, didst put off) my sackcloth. That the king had clothed himself in sackcloth on the occasion, is mentioned by the author of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 21:16). And girded (girdedst) me with gladness (comp. 1 Chronicles 21:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee. If we allow the ellipse of the personal pronoun supposed by our translators and Revisers, we must regard David as calling his soul \"his glory,\" as in Psalm 16:9. But some commentators think that \"glory\" is here used as we use \"royalty,\" and designates the royal person or the royal office (so Kay and Professor Alexander). And not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Great mercies deserve perpetual remembrance. David regarded the mercy at this time vouchsafed him as one which, like that vouchsafed Hezekiah, required to be commemorated \"all the days of his life\" (Isaiah 38:20).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.31":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust. If prayer to God for aid in a special time of trouble is the main object of the psalm, the expression of full trust in God is a secondary object, and is maintained throughout (see vers. 3-8, 14, 19-21, 24). Notwithstanding the extremity of his danger, his belief is firm in the coming overthrow of his enemies, and in his own deliverance and restoration. Let me never be ashamed (comp. ver. 17, where the idea is expanded). David's enemies having come to an open rupture with him, and appealed to arms (2 Samuel 15:10-12; 2 Samuel 17:24-26), one party or the other must of necessity be put to shame. Here he prays that it may not be himself; in ver. 17 he goes a step further, and asks that the shame may fall upon his enemies. Deliver me in thy righteousness. Seeing that my cause is the righteous one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Bow down thine ear to me; or, incline thine ear to me, as the same phrase is translated in Psalm 71:2. Deliver me speedily. Not doubting of deliverance, he makes his request for speedy deliverance (comp. Psalm 38:22; Psalm 40:17; Psalm 70:1; Psalm 71:12, etc.). Be thou my strong Rock, for an House of defence to save me; rather, as in the Revised Version, Be thou to me a strong Rock, an House of defence, etc. (comp. Psalm 18:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3., - For thou art my Rock; or, my cliff (סלעי, not צורי). And my Fortress. David prays God to be his Rock and Fortress in the future, because he has always looked to him as his Rock and Fortress in the past. Faith establishes a claim to have its anticipations made good. Therefore for thy Name's sake lead me, and guide me. Metaphor is dropped, and God is simply asked for guidance and direction. In the struggle between Absalom and David more depended upon wise counsel than upon mere force (2 Samuel 15:31-37; 2 Samuel 16:15-23; 2 Samuel 17:5-23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me. Absalom set a imp for David when he asked permission to go to Hebron for the purpose of paying a vow, whereas his object was to get possession of a strongly fortified city (2 Samuel 15:7-9). It was, perhaps, by a device of AhithopheI's that David was induced to quit Jerusalem and go into exile. For thou art my Strength (comp. Psalm 18:1; 19:15; 28:1, 7, 8, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInto thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Into thine hand I commit my spirit. Our Lord's adoption of these words, and application of them to himself and his own departure from earth, have given them a special sacredness beyond that which attaches to Scripture generally. At the same time, they have impressed on them a new meaning, since David was not thinking of a final committal of his soul, as distinct from his body, into the hands of the Creator, but only intended solemnly to commit himself, both soul and body, into the Divine keeping, to be preserved from the attacks of his enemies. Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth; or, thou hast delivered me, O Lord God of truth. It is redemption in the general sense of \"deliverance from peril,\" not redemption from sin, of which the psalmist speaks. David, having frequently experienced such deliverance in the past, is emboldened to expect now another deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I have hated them that regard lying vanities. By \"lying vanities\" are meant idolatrous practices, or possibly such superstitious usages as recourse to witch-craft and divination. (For David's hatred of such persons as are here glanced at, see Psalm 26:5.) But I trust in the Lord. Who is the direct opposite of all \"lying vanities,\" being at once Almighty, and the \"God of truth\" (ver. 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. Anticipating the \"mercy\" which he has craved (vers. 2-4), the psalmist determines to \"be glad and rejoice in it.\" For thou hast considered my trouble. When God looks upon trouble and considers it, he is sure to compassionate the sufferer, and to grant him some relief. Thou hast known my soul in adversities (comp. Psalm 1:6, \"The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous\" ). God is said to \"know\" those on whom he looks with approval.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; i.e. \"hast not delivered me up, without chance of escape, into the hands of my enemies\" (comp. 1 Samuel 23:12). Thou hast set my feet in a large room. Given me, i.e., plenty of space and freedom for action; not confined me, nor cramped me, nor hindered me in any way (comp. Psalm 4:1; Psalm 18:36). Having cheered himself with the enumeration of these grounds of encouragement (vers. 5-8), the psalmist again returns to prayer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble. The psalmist follows up his prayer for mercy by an exposition of his need of mercy. He is in trouble, in sore trouble - \"hard pressed,\" as Hengstenberg translates - distressed both in mind and body. Mine eye is consumed with grief (comp. Psalm 6:7, where the expression is almost identical). The grief intended is \"that produced by provocation or spiteful treatment\" (Kay). It causes him to weep so much that his eye is well-nigh \"consumed\" or \"eaten away.\" Yea, my soul and my belly. Some explain this as meaning simply \"my soul and my body\" (Hengstenberg, Alexander, Revised Version); but others regard the \"belly\" as denoting \"the very centre of physical life and of the emotions\" (comp. Job 32:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing. The psalmist's grief is of old standing. It dates from the time of his great sin (2 Samuel 11:4-17), which is thought to have preceded the revolt of Absalom by the space of twelve years. This sin necessitated a lifelong repentance (Psalm 38:17; Psalm 51:3, etc.). My strength faileth because of mine iniquity. Other causes had, no doubt, contributed to produce the profound depression of the psalmist at this period, but none was of equal force with this (comp. Psalm 38:3-10; Psalm 51:1-14, etc.). It caused his strength to fail utterly, and led to complete prostration both st mind and body. And my bones are consumed; i.e. racked with pain, as though they were being gnawed away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I was a reproach among all mine enemies; rather, I am become a reproach (Kay, Revised Version). The psalmist complains of the loss of his reputation. Absalom's rebellion was preceded by a long course of calumnious accusation of David (2 Samuel 15:1-4), whereby men's hearts were stolen away from him, and his character blackened. His enemies made the most of these ill reports, and turned them to his reproach (camp. Psalm 69:18-20). But especially among my neighbours. Not that they reproached him more than others, but that he felt their reproaches more keenly. And a fear to mine acquaintance. His acquaintances were afraid of being recognized as such, and involved in his ill repute. They that did sea me without; i.e. \"out of doors,\" or \"in the street.\" Fled from me. Avoided my contact, not wishing to be seen with me (comp. Psalm 88:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind (comp. Psalm 88:5). I am like a broken vessel. Of no value to any one; only fit to be thrown away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For I have heard the slander of many (see the comment on ver. 11). The calumnies circulated against him had reached David's ears, and these had so affected him that he felt as described in the preceding verse. Fear was on every side, while they took counsel together against me. Fear was \"on every side\" - in his own heart, and in the hearts of all his friends - when it came to the point of his enemies holding a formal council, in which the matter discussed was the best mode of proceeding against him to take away his life. The particulars of such a council are given in 2 Samuel 17:1-14. They devised to take away my life. That David's life was sought is apparent from the last clause of ver. 2, \"I will smite the king only.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But I trusted in thee, O Lord. Having fully represented the miserable condition to which he is reduced (vers. 9-13), David now returns to expressions of trust in God, and to earnest prayer to him (comp. ver. 6). I said, Thou art my God; rather, I have said. In all my sufferings, dangers, and difficulties, I have always clung to thee, and said, \"Thou, and thou alone, art, and ever shalt be, my God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My times are in thy hand. \"My times,\" i.e. \"all the varied events, happy or sad, which make up the parti-coloured web of life\" (Kay). Not one of them but is shaped by thee and ordered by thee. Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me (camp. vers. 1, 2, 4). The great need under existing circumstances was deliverance. Absalom was looked for daily to \"pass over Jordan, and all the men of Israel with him\" (2 Samuel 17:24). A battle was imminent. If the day went against David, and his army was defeated, he would necessarily fall into the hands of his \"enemies\" and \"persecutors,\" in which case he could not hope that they would spare his life (2 Samuel 17:2, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Make thy face to shine upon thy servant. This expression is first used in the blessing of Moses (Numbers 6:25). Its intrinsic beauty and poetry recommended it to the psalmists, with whom it recurs frequently (camp. Psalm 4:6; Psalm 67:1; Psalm 80:5, 7, 19; Psalm 119:135). It may be regarded as equivalent to \"Be thou favourable and gracious unto thy servant.\" Save me for thy mercies' sake; literally, save me in thy mercy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let me not be ashamed, O Lord (see the comment on ver. l). For I have called upon thee. \"I have,\" i.e., \"been ever thy true worshipper.\" Even when I have sinned (ver. 10), my sins have not been \"sins of unfaithfulness,\" but lapses, sins of infirmity, unpremeditated yieldings to temptation. Let the wicked be ashamed. Bring shame, i.e., upon those who are at once my enemies and thine - the wicked and impenitent generally - and, among them on my present adversaries, those who are collected together to carry on war against me. And let them be silent in the grave; or, in Sheol. Let a stop be put to their slanders (ver. 13) and lying speeches (ver. 18); let them he silenced by removal from this world to the land of the departed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Let the lying lips be put to silence, which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous; rather, which speak arrogancy (camp. 1 Samuel 2:3). The pride and insolence of David's enemies is strongly noted in the Second Book of Samuel (see 16:7, 8; 17:1-3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! Another transition. David turns from prayer to praise, and in the four next verses (vers. 19-22) eulogizes the goodness and mercy and marvellous loving-kindness of God, who has wrought gloriously for his people in the past, and has further an ample store of mercies laid up for them in the future. Which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men! God had wrought his mercies for his own people, but in the sight of men generally, whether good or bad.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thou shalt hide (or, thou hidest) them in the secret of thy presence from the pride (rather, conspiracies) of man. Intense light forms as good a hiding-place as intense darkness. No vision can penetrate it. It is \"too dazzling bright for mortal eye.\" Thus those whom God brings close to himself, and on whom he pours the light of his countenance, need no other protection. Their life is hid in God. Thou shalt keep them (or, thou keepest them) secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. God keeps his own in a \"pavilion,\" or leafy arbour, a place of coolness and refreshment, far away from the \"lying lips\" (ver. 18) and slanderous tongues (ver. 13) of the ungodly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Blessed be the Lord: for he hath showed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. The \"strong city\" has been explained as Ziklag (Delitzsch), or Maha-naim (2 Samuel 17:24), but is probably as much a figure of speech as the \"pavilion\" of ver. 20. God has showed David his marvellous loving-kindness by giving him an assurance of absolute security.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For I said in my haste; rather, and I indeed had said in my haste (comp. Psalm 116:11). David's faith was not so firmly fixed but that he was liable, from time to time, to a sudden access of fear (see 1 Samuel 27:1; 2 Samuel 15:14; Psalm 31:13). He had said to God in his heart, on one such occasion, I am cut off from before thine eyes; i.e. he had despaired and given himself up for lost. It is somewhat forced to understand the words as meaning, \"I am banished from the city where the ark is placed\" ('Speaker's Commentary'). Nevertheless, thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee. God did not forsake his servant on account of this temporary failure of faith. No sooner did the psalmist rid himself of his extreme alarm, and turn once more to God in prayer, than he was heard, and his prayer answered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - O love ye the Lord, all ye his saints. The psalmist winds up with a short burst of song, in which his heart goes out to others. He calls upon all God's saints to \"love\" him, on the ground of his own experience, which is that the Lord preserveth the faithful (literally, those who stand firm, Kay), and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer; i.e. visits with ample vengeance such as in their pride set themselves against him and against his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm31:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Be of good courage (see the comment on Psalm 27:14). And he (i.e. God) shall strengthen your heart. \"To those who have it shall be given.\" If they did their best to \"be of good courage\" when danger and difficulty assailed them, then God would give them supernatural aid, strengthening their hearts with his gracious favour. All ye that hope in the Lord; literally, all ye that hope for the Lord; i.e. that hope for his help - that wait on him (see Job 14:14; and comp. Psalm 33:18, 22), and look to him as your Deliverer.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, and whose sin is covered. There are three aspects under which sin is viewed in Holy Scripture:NEWLINENEWLINE1. As an offence against God's Law. This is \"transgression\" - ἀνομία.NEWLINENEWLINE2. As an offence against the eternal and immutable rule of right. This is \"sin\" - ἁμαρτία.NEWLINENEWLINE3. As an internal depravation and defilement of the sinner's soul. This is \"iniquity \" - ἀδικία (comp. Exodus 34:7). Each aspect of sin has its own especial remedy, or manner of removal. The \"transgression\" is \"lifted up,\" \"taken away,\"- αἵρεται ἀφαίρεται - more vaguely ἀφίεται. The \"sin\" is \"covered, .... hidden\" - καλύπτετα ἐπικαλύπτεται. The \"iniquity\" is \"not imputed\" - οὐ λογίζεται. The union of all three, as here in vers. 1, 2, is complete remission or forgiveness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity. \"Iniquity\" - the defilement of the sinner's own soul by sin - is not at once removable; if removable at all, it is only so by long lapse of time, and God's special mercy. But God can, at his own will and at any moment, \"not impute\" it - not count it against the sinner to his detriment. Then in God's sight the man is clean; it is as though the iniquity were not there. And in whose spirit there is no guile; i.e. no false seeming - no hypocrisy - where repentance has been sincere and real.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When I kept silence; i.e. so long as I did not acknowledge my sin - while I remained silent about it, quite aware that I hod sinned grievously, suffering in conscience, but not confessing it even to myself. The time spoken of is that which immediately followed the commission of the adultery, and which continued until Nathan uttered the words, \"Thou art the man!\" (2 Samuel 12:7). My bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long; i.e. I suffered grievous pain, both bodily and mental. My bones ached (comp. Psalm 6:2; Psalm 31:10); and I \"roared,\" or groaned, in spirit, all the day long.\" Unconfessed sin rankles in the heart of a man who is not far gone in vice, but has been surprised into a wicked action, no sooner done than regretted. Such a one, in Archbishop Leighton's words, \"Vulnus alit venis et caeco carpitur igne.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me. David sees now that his sufferings at this time came from God, and were a part of the punishment of his sin. They continued without intermission both by day and by night. His conscience was never wholly at rest. My moisture is turned into the drought of summer; literally, my sap was changed through summer drought; i.e. the vital principle, which had been strong in him, was changed - burnt up and exhausted - by the heat of God's wrath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I acknowledged my sin unto thee (comp. 2 Samuel 12:13). Conscience once fully awakened, all reticence was broken down. David confessed his sin fully and freely - confessed it as \"sin,\" as \"transgression,\" and as \"iniquity\" (compare the comment on ver. 1). And mine iniquity have I not hid; rather, did I not hide. I did not attempt to gloss over or conceal the extent of my guilt, but laid my soul bare before thee. Hengstenberg well remarks that the psalmist is probably not speaking of a \"making known by the mouth,\" but of \"an inward confession, such as is accompanied with painful repentance and sorrow, with begging of pardon for sin and for the offence rendered to the Divine Majesty.\" I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Upon David's confession, whether it were inward or outward, followed without any interval God's forgiveness - forgiveness which, however, did not preclude the exaction of a penalty required for the justification of God's ways to man (2 Samuel 12:14), and also, perhaps, for proper impressing of the offender himself, who would have been less sensible of the heinousness of his sin, if it had gone unpunished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For this; or, because of this; i.e. on account of this experience of mine - this immediate following of the grant of forgiveness upon confession of sin - shall every one that is godly - i.e., that is sincere and earnest in religion, though he may be overtaken in a fault or surprised into a sin - pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found; literally, in a time of finding, which some understand as a time when God \"finds,\" and visits, some iniquity in his servants, and others, as the Authorized Version, \"in a time when thou art gracious, and allowest thyself to be found by those who approach thee.\" Surely in the floods of great waters they (i.e. the waters) shall not come nigh unto him; i.e. shall not approach such a man to injure him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou art my hiding-place (comp. Psalm 17:8; Psalm 27:5; Psalm 31:20; Psalm 143:9); thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Hidden in God, there can no harm happen to him. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. \"Songs of deliver-ante\" are such songs as men sing when they have been delivered from peril. God will make such songs to sound in the psalmist's ears or in his heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - St. Jerome, and others after him, including Dr. Kay, have regarded this passage as an utterance of God, who first admonishes David, and then passes on to an admonition of the Israelites generally. But such a sudden intrusion of a Divine utterance, without any notice of a change of speaker, is without parallel in the Psalms, and should certainly not be admitted without some plain necessity. Here is no necessity at all. The words are quite suitable in the mouth of David, as an admonition to the Israelites of his time; they accord with the title, which he himself seems to have prefixed to the psalm, and explain it; and they fulfil the promise made in Psalm 51:15. Verse 8. - I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go. We must suppose the \"godly man\" of ver. 6 addressed, if we regard David as the speaker. Such a man was not beyond the need of instruction and teaching, since he was liable to sins of infirmity, and even to grievous falls, as had been seen by David's example. I will guide thee with mine eye; i.e. \"I will keep watch over thee with mine eye, and guide thee as I see to be necessary.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding. The singular is exchanged for the plural, since the \"instruction\" is now intended, not for the godly man only, but for all. Israel had been always stiff-necked (Exodus 32:9; Exodus 33:3, 5; Exodus 34:9; Deuteronomy 9:6, 13; Deuteronomy 10:16; 2 Chronicles 30:8; Acts 7:51), like a restive horse or mule. David exhorts them to be so no more. The horse and mule are excusable, since they \"have no understanding \" - or, \"no discernment\" - Israel would be inexcusable, since it had the gift of reason. Whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle; rather, whose adornings are with bit and bridle to hold them in (compare the Revised Version). Lest they come near unto thee. This clause is obscure. It may mean, \"Lest they come too near to thee,\" so as to do thee damage, as when a riding horse tosses his head and strikes the rider in the face, or when a chariot horse rears and falls back upon the driver; or it may mean, \"Else they will not come near to thee,\" i.e. until they are trapped with bit and bridle, they will refuse to come near to thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Many sorrows shall be to the wicked. A further warning to those addressed in the preceding verse. The LXX. emphasize this by substituting for the generic \"sorrows\" the specific μάστιγες, \"lashes,\" the usual punishment of the horse and mule. But he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about (comp. Deuteronomy 32:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous. David's psalms almost always end with a note of joy, or at any rate in a tone that is cheerful and encouraging. The present psalm, though reckoned among the penitential ones, both begins and ends with joyful utterances. In vers. 1, 2 David pours forth the feeling of gladness which fills his own heart. Here he calls upon the \"righteous\" generally, who yet need forgiveness, to rejoice with him. And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart. All ye, i.e., who are honest and sincere in your endeavours after well-doing. The phrase explains the \"righteous\" of the preceding hemistich.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.33":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous (see the first clause of Psalm 32:11, of which this is almost a repetition; and comp. also Psalm 68:3; Psalm 97:12). For praise is comely for the upright. The Prayer-book Version gives the meaning, less literally, but in more idiomatic English, \"For it becometh well the just to be thankful.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Praise the Lord with harp. The harp obtains mention here for the first time in the Psalms. Reference, however, had been made to it previously in Genesis, Job, and the First Book of Samuel. There is reason to believe that the instrument, as known to the Hebrews, was a simple one, consisting of a nearly triangular framework of wood, crossed by seven strings. The Egyptians were acquainted from early times with a very much more elaborate instrument - harps which stood six feet high upon a broad base of their own, and had as many as twenty-two strings (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 521). The harp was regarded by the Hebrews as peculiarly fitted for sacred music (see 1 Samuel 10:5; 2 Samuel 6:5; 1 Chronicles 15:16; 1 Chronicles 25:1, 3, 6; 2 Chronicles 5:12; 2 Chronicles 29:25; Nehemiah 12:27, etc.). Sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings; rather, sing unto him with the lute of ten strings. One instrument only is here mentioned - a lute or psaltery (nebel), having ten strings (comp. Psalm 92:3; Psalm 144:9). The nebel was an instrument differing from the harp chiefly in the arrangement of the strings. It was used in the temple service, as appears from 1 Chronicles 15:6, 28; 1 Chronicles 25:1, 6; 2 Chronicles 5:12; 2 Chronicles 29:25, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Sing unto him a new song (comp. Psalm 40:3; Psalm 96:1; Psalm 98:1; Isaiah 42:10; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 14:3). Not necessarily a song unheard before, but one fresh from the singer's heart. Play skilfully with a loud noise. The loudness of a thanksgiving song was regarded as an indication of its heartiness (comp. Psalm 98:4; Psalm 100:1; Psalm 150:5; and see also 2 Chronicles 20:19; 2 Chronicles 30:21; Ezra 3:11-13; Nehemiah 12:42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The psalmist proceeds to give reasons why God is to be praised, and puts in the forefront this reason: For the word of the lord is right; i.e. the revealed will of God is exactly in accord with the eternal rule of right. We cannot imagine it otherwise, for God would contradict his own nature, if he ordained by a positive law anything contrary to that rule. But still we maybe thankful that there is no such contradiction - that \"the Law is holy, just, and good\" (Romans 7:12). And all his works are done in truth (comp. Psalm 111:7, 8, \"The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and equity\"). All God's working (מעשׂה), all his dealings with his creatures have truth and equity and faithfulness for their basis. He can be thoroughly trusted. This is a second and very strong ground for thanksgiving.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He loveth righteousness and judgment. \"Righteousness\" is the essential principle of justice; \"judgment,\" the carrying out of the principle in act. God loves both - a further ground for praising him. The earth is full of the goodness (or, loving-kindness) of the Lord (comp. Psalm 119:64). The earth is full, not only of God's glory (Isaiah 6:3) and of his riches (Psalm 104:24), but also of his mercy, or loving-kindness (חסד) - a ground of thankfulness that all will acknowledge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - By the word of the Lord were the heavens made. God is to be praised, not only for his goodness, but also for his greatness, and especially for his greatness in creation (see Psalm 19:1-6). The heavens were made \"by his word\" in a double sense - by the Word, who is the Second Person of the Trinity (John 1:3; Hebrews 1:2, 10), and by a mere utterance, without the employment of any mechanical means, as we learn from Genesis 1:6-8. And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. The \"host of heaven\" is here, undoubtedly, the host of heavenly bodies - the sun, moon, and stars - as in Genesis 2:1. These were made \"by the breath of God's mouth;\" i.e. by his simple utterance of the command - \"Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night\" (Genesis 1:14; comp. Job 26:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap. An allusion to Genesis 1:8, but with a glance also at Exodus 15:8 and Joshua 3:13-16; as if the original gathering, and continued retention, of the sea in one convex mass were as great a proof of omnipotence as the miracles related in those passages. Nes (נֵס), \"a heap\" occurs only in the places cited, here, and in Psalm 78:13. He layeth up the depth in storehouses; literally, the deeps. The waters of the great deep are regarded as stored up by the Almighty in the hugo cavities of the ocean bed for his own use, to be employed at some time or other in carrying out his purposes (comp. Genesis 7:11 and Job 38:22, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-11. - From the exhortation in ver. 1, addressed to the righteous, to praise the Lord, the psalmist passes now to a second exhortation, addressed to all mankind, to fear the Lord. And as before in vers. 4-7, so now in veto. 9-11, he assigns reasons. God is to be fearedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) on account of the power which he showed in creation (ver. 9);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) on account of his ability to baffle all human counsels that are opposed to him (ver. 10); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) on account of the unehangeableness and perpetuity of his own counsels, which nothing can alter (ver. 11). Verse 8. - Let all the earth fear the Lord. The righteous alone have a right to \"praise\" God (see ver. 1), but \"all the earth\" - i.e. all mankind - may be called upon to \"fear\" him. He is an object of awe and true \"godly fear\" to godly men; to the ungodly he is an object of terror and servile fear. Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. Here again, as so often, the second hemistich merely echoes the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For he spake, and it was done; rather, and it was; the thing of which he spake at once existed. See the passage of Genesis which Longinus thought so striking an instance of the sublime, \"And God said, Let there be light; and there was light\" (Genesis 1:8). He commanded, and it stood fast; literally, and it stood. God's lightest word, once uttered, is a standing law, to which nature absolutely conforms, and man ought to conform (comp. Psalm 119:90, 91).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought; literally, frustrates the counsel of the heathen, causes it to fail (see 2 Kings 6:8-12; Daniel 6:5-28). He maketh the devices of the people - rather, the peoples - of none effect. Another instance of the mere repetition of a thought in other words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations; or, the thoughts of his heart - the same word as in the latter clause of the preceding verse. The contrast is made as complete as possible. Human counsels and devices fail and come to nought, the Divine counsels and devices abide, stand fast, and remain firm for ever (comp. Proverbs 19:21; Isaiah 25:1; James 1:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-19. - Further reasons for praising God are now assigned, the recitation of them being itself a sort of praise.NEWLINENEWLINE1.

His gracious influences are poured out on the hearts of all (ver. 15).NEWLINENEWLINE4. He is the sole Protector and Deliverer of men from danger and death (vers. 16-19). Verse 12. - Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord (comp. Psalm 144:15). In other words, \"Blessed is the people of Israel.\" Other nations did not know God as Jehovah - the Self-existent One - or, indeed, as a general rule, recognize any one and only God. And the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. The intrusion of the word \"and\" is unfortunate. One \"nation\" or \"people\" only is spoken of, viz. the Hebrews. They are \"blessed\" in two respects: first, because they know God as Jehovah; and secondly, because he has chosen them out of all the nations of the earth to be his \"peculiar people\" (see Exodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 4:20; Deuteronomy 7:6; Deuteronomy 14:2; 1 Kings 8:53; Psalm 135:4, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men (comp. Psalm 11:4: 14:2; 102:19). God's having any care at all for man is a wondrous condescension, and so worthy of all praise; his having regard to all men - all the frail sons of weak and sinful Adam - is still more wonderful, still more deserving of eulogy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - From the place of his habitation (i.e. heaven) he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth. A repetition of the thought expressed in ver. 13 for the sake of emphasis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He fashioneth their hearts alike; rather, he mouldeth the hearts of them all. The hearts of all men are in God's keeping, and his gracious influences are exerted to \"mould\" them aright. Some hearts are too stubborn to yield themselves up to his fashioning, and refuse to take the impress which he desires to impart; but all, or almost all, owe it to him that they are not worse than they are. He considereth all their works; rather, he understandeth all their works - estimates, i.e., all they do at its just value, knowing the true nature of each act, its motive, aim, essence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - There is no king saved by the multitude of an host; literally, the king is not saved by the greatness of his host. The article, however, is used generically, as it is with \"horse\" in the next verse, so that the translation of the Authorized Version gives the true sense. (For illustration of the sentiment, see 2 Chronicles 14:11; 1 Macc. 3:19.) A mighty man is not delivered by much strength (comp. 1 Samuel 17:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A horse is a vain thing for safety; literally, the horse; i.e. the species, horse, is not to be depended on for safety - it is \"a vain thing,\" quite unable to secure victory, or even escape, to those who trust in it. The use of the horse in war seems certainly to be implied here as familiar to the writer, whence it is rightly concluded that he must have lived later than the time of David. Solomon was the first Israelite king who enrolled a chariot and a cavalry force (1 Kings 10:26). Neither shall he deliver any by his great strength. (On the \"great strength\" of the horse, see Job 39:19; Psalm 147:10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him; upon them that hope in his mercy. The eye of the Lord is in a certain sense upon all (vers. 13, 14), but it rests especially upon the righteous. He notes how all men act, but carefully watches over the safety and prosperity of his faithful onesNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - To deliver their soul from death. The protection and deliverance, which a man's own strength cannot give, which no host, however numerous, can afford (ver. 16), which are not to be obtained from the largest chariot or cavalry force (ver. 17), can he and will be furnished freely by God, who alone keeps souls from death, and \"delivers\" those who are in peril. And to keep them alive in famine. Famine was a calamity from which Palestine often suffered (see Genesis 12:10; Genesis 26:1; Genesis 42:5; Ruth 1:1; 2 Samuel 21:1; 1 Kings 18:5; 2 Kings 8:1, etc.). The righteous were sometimes \"kept alive\" through a time of famine by miraculous means (1 Kings 17:6, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-22. - A brief address of the people to God, arising out of what has been declared concerning his goodness (vers. 4, 5, 12-19) and his power (vers. 6-11), which constitute a call upon them for praise and adoration. Verse 20. - Our soul waiteth for the Lord (comp. Psalm 25:21; Psalm 62:1, 5; Psalm 130:5, 6, etc.). Confident in God's good will, and in his power to help us, we wait patiently and cheerfully for him to manifest himself in his own good time. He is our Help and our Shield. We trust in no one and nothing but him - not in armies (ver. 16), not in horses (ver. 17), not in our own strength (ver. 16). He alone is our dependence. (For the use of the metaphor \"shield\" for defence, see Psalm 5:12; Psalm 18:2; Psalm 28:7; Psalm 91:4; Psalm 119:114, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy Name (comp.

Trust in God secures his help, and this brings the deliverance at which the heart rejoices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in thee. The measure of men's hope and trust in God is the measure of his mercy and goodness to them. Those who are assured that they have a full trust in him may confidently expect a fall and complete deliverance.

If the statement in the title may be relied upon, David's fortunes were now at the lowest ebb. He had fled from the court of Saul on finding that Saul was determined to put him to death (1 Samuel 20:31). He had hoped to find a safe refuge with Achish, but had been disappointed. He was on the point of becoming a fugitive and an outlaw, a dweller in dens and caves of the earth (1 Samuel 22:1). He had as yet no body of followers. We cannot but admire his piety in composing, at such a time, a song of thanksgiving to God. His praise shall continually be in my mouth (comp. Psalm 92:1, 2; Psalm 145:1, 2; Psalm 146:1, 2; Ephesians 5:20; 1 Thessalonians 5:18). \"Continually\" must be understood as meaning either \"every day\" or \"many times every day,\" but must not be taken quite literally, or the business of life would be at a stand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - My soul shall make her boast in the Lord (comp.

The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. They will anticipate joy for themselves when they hear of my rejoicing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his Name together. Not content with praising God in his own person, the psalmist calls on Israel generally to praise the Lord with him. He then proceeds to assign reasons why God should be praised (vers. 4-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I sought the Lord, and he heard me. To \"seek the Lord\" is not merely to trust in him, but to fly to him, and make our requests of him in our troubles. David apparently speaks of some special occasion on which he \"sought the Lord,\" and some special request which he made of him, but does not tell us what the occasion or request was. We may presume that it was in some way connected with his \"escape to the cave Adullam\" (1 Samuel 22:1). And delivered me from all my fears; literally, frown all the things which I feared (comp. Isaiah 66:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They looked unto him, and were lightened; or, were brightened (Hengstenberg); i.e. had their countenances lighted up and cheered. And their faces were not ashamed. As they would have been if God had made no response to their appeal (comp. Psalm 25:2, 3; Psalm 74:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. Almost a repetition of ver. 4, but in the third person instead of the first. The \"poor man\" intended is David him* self, not an ideal poor man. Otherwise the demonstrative \"this\" (זֶה) would not have been employed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. According to some commentators (Rosenmuller, 'Four Friends,' and others), the expression, \"angel of the Lord,\" is here used as a collective, and means the angels generally. With this certainly agrees the statement that the angel \"encampeth round about them that fear him;\" and the illustration from 2 Kings 6:14-18 is thus exactly apposite. But others deny that \"the angel of the Lord\" has ever a collective sense, and think a single personality must necessarily* be intended, which they regard as identical with \"the captain of the Lord's host,\" who appeared to Joshua (Joshua 5:14, 15), and \"the angel of the Lord's presence\" spoken of by Isaiah (Isaiah 63:9); so Kay, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Professor Alexander, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' When pressed to say how this one angel can \"encamp round\" a number of persons, they reply that, of course, he has his subordinates with him - a \"spangled host,\" that \"keep watch in squadrons bright;\" and that he is said to do what they do, which is no doubt quite in accordance with ordinary modes of speech. Thus, however, the two expositions become nearly identical, since, according to both, it is the angelic host which \"encamps around\" the faithful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - O taste and see that the Lord is good; i.e. put the matter to the test of experience (comp. 1 Peter 2:3). There is no other way of really knowing how good God is. Blessed is the man that trusteth in him (comp. Psalm 2:12; Psalm 84:12; Proverbs 16:20; Isaiah 30:18; Jeremiah 17:7). Trust in God is a feeling which is blessed in itself. God also showers blessings on such as trust in him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - O fear the Lord, ye his saints. Fear of God, a reverent and godly fear, will always accompany trust in God, such as God approves. The saints of God both love and fear him (comp. Psalm 31:23). There is no want to them that fear 'him since God supplies all their wants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger. Some suppose the \"young lions\" here to represent the proud and violent, as in Job 4:10. But it is simpler to take the present passage literally. In God's animal creation even the strongest suffer want for a time, and have no remedy; his human creatures need never be in want, since they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. It is open to them to \"seek the Lord\" at any time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-22. - The second, didactic, part of the psalm here begins. The writer assumes the role of the teacher, and, addressing his readers as \"sons,\" undertakes to \"teach them the fear of the Lord\" (ver, 11), or, in other words, to point out to them in what true religion consists. This he does in two remarkable verses (vers. 13, 14); after which he proceeds, in the remainder of the psalm, to give reasons which may incline them to the practice of it (vers. 15-22). The reasons resolve themselves into two main grounds - the tender love and care of God for the righteous (vers. 15, 17-20, 22), and his hostility to and punishment of the wicked (vers. 16, 21). Verse 11. - Come, ye children, hearken unto me (comp. Proverbs 4:1; Proverbs 8:32; 1 John 2:1, 18; 1 John 3:18; 1 John 4:4, etc.). I will teach you the fear of the Lord; i.e. I will teach you the nature of true religion. Note the absence from what follows of any merely legal requirements, and the simple insist-ance on right moral conduct (vers. 13, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - What man is he that desireth life? Like most moralists, David begins with asking men - Do they wish for happiness? If so, and he assumes that it is so (comp. Arist., 'Eth. Nic.,' I. 1. - 7.), then he will point them out the way to it. And loveth many days, that he may see good? Mere life, mere length of days, would not suffice for men, would be no object of desire, unless it were assumed that the days would bring them \"good\" - in other words, that they would be happy days.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. If the end be happiness, the means will be right moral conduct; and, first of all, right government of the tongue. Sins of the tongue are numerous, and abundantly noted in the Psalms (Psalm 5:9; Psalm 10:7; Psalm 12:3; Psalm 15:3; Psalm 50:19; Psalm 57:4; Psalm 73:8, 9, etc.). They are more difficult to avoid than any others; they cling closer to us; they are scarcely ever wholly laid aside. \"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body\" (James 3:2). The meek Moses \"spake unadvisedly with his lips\" (Psalm 106:33). Job \"darkened counsel by words without knowledge \"(Job 38:2). St. Peter's words on one occasion drew upon him the rebuke, \"Get thee behind me, Satan\" (Matthew 16:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDepart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Depart from evil, and do good. From words the psalmist proceeds to acts, and, in the briefest possible way, says all that can be said. First, he enjoins negative goodness - \"depart from evil,\" i.e. do nothing that is wrong; break no laws of God, no command of conscience; have a conscience void of offence, both towards God and towards man. Secondly, he requires positive goodness - \"Do good;\" i.e. actively perform the will of God from the heart; discharge every duty; practise every virtue; carry out the precepts of the moral law in every particular. Seek peace, and pursue it. It is not clear why this virtue - one of many - is specially enjoined; but probably some circumstances of the time made the recommendation advisable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous (comp. Job 36:7; Psalm 33:18; 1 Peter 3:12; and see the comment on Psalm 33:18). And his ears are open unto their cry. The specific statement of ver. 6 is now generalized. What God had done in the case of the psalmist, he will do in all other similar cases. His eyes will be open to his people's needs, and his ears attent unto their prayers (2 Chronicles 6:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. Conversely, God turns away his face from the wicked, and punishes them by causing their very memory to perish from among men (comp. Job 18:17; Psalm 109:13; Proverbs 10:7). The natural wish for continuance, which causes men to build themselves monuments, and erect other great works, and delight in offspring, and seek to establish their families, and create entails, and have their portraits taken, and \"call the lands after their own names\" (Psalm 49:11), was especially strong in the Hebrew race, and made the threat that their remembrance should be cut off peculiarly terrible to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth; literally, they cry, and the Lord heareth. \"Cry,\" which by the ordinary rules of grammar should have for its subject the \"evil-doers\" of the preceding verse, must, it is obvious from the context, refer to the \"righteous\" of ver. 15, who are the predominant subject of the entire passage(vers. 15-22). And delivereth them out of all their troubles (comp. ver. 19 and Psalm 54:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and sayeth such as be of a contrite spirit. On the value in God's sight of a broken and contrite heart, see Psalm 2:17; and on his mercy towards the truly contrite, see Psalm 147:3; Isaiah 57:15; 69:2. He \"is nigh\" to such persons, he \"dwells with\" them, \"looks to them, .... revives their heart, .... heals\" them, \"saves\" them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Many are the afflictions of the righteous (comp. Job 36:8-10; Acts 14:22; 1 Corinthians 15:19; 2 Timothy 3:12; Hebrews 11:33-38; Hebrews 12:5-10, etc.). The righteous suffer afflictions because they are so imperfectly righteous. They need purging, purifying, chastening, to rid them of the dross and defilement of sin which still clings to them, and from which they are never wholly freed while they continue in the flesh. \"We must through mush tribulation enter into the kingdom of God\" (Acts 14:22). We must, like the Captain of our salvation, be \"made perfect through suffering\" (Hebrews 2:10). But the Lord delivereth him out of them all. When they have done their appointed work of purging, purifying, instructing, improving, or whatever else their work may be, God removes the afflictions with which he has visited us or allowed us to be visited, ultimately, when he takes us to himself, mercifully delivering us \"out of them all.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken. The \"bones\" are put for the entire frame, or body, of a man (comp. Psalm 6:2; Psalm 31:10; Psalm 32:3; Psalm 38:3; Psalm 42:10; Psalm 102:3). God \"keepeth,\" i.e. watches over, keeps from harm, the entire persons of the righteous, letting no hurt touch them, but such as he permits and sees to be needful. In using the phrase, \"not one of them is broken,\" the psalmist probably alludes to Exodus 12:46 and Numbers 9:12, taking the Paschal lamb as a type of innocence, and so of godliness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Evil shall slay the wicked. His own misconduct shall bring destruction upon the wicked man-destruction of the body in many cases (Psalm 7:15, 16), in all, if he persists in his wickedness, destruction of the soul. And they that hate the righteous shall be desolate; rather, shall be held guilty (comp. Psalm 5:10, and the comment ad loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm34:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants (comp. Psalm 25:22; Psalm 130:8). Some translate, \"The Lord delivers,\" etc. But the LXX. have λυρώσεται. And the verb used means primarily, as Dr. Kay says, \"to sever,\" then \"to set free, release, emancipate; especially to set free by paying a price; to redeem, or ransom.\" And none of them that trust in him shall be desolate; rather, shall be held guilty, or shall be condemned - the same word as in the preceding verse (comp. Romans 8:33, 34). Those whom God has redeemed he justifies, and saves from all condemnation. They are \"passed from death unto life\" (John 5:24).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.35":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me (comp. 1 Samuel 24:15, \"The Lord therefore be Judge, and judge between me and thee; and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.\" The word translated \"plead\" is a judicial term; but the context shows that it was in the battle-field, rather than in the law-courts, that David's cause was to be pleaded. The second hemistich is therefore added to explain and correct the first; it is fighting, not pleading, that is needed under the circumstances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take hold of shield and buckler. \"The shield (magen) was a smaller hand-weapon; the buckler (tsinnah)covered the whole body\" (Kay). The \"shield and buckler\" are put forward first, because it is primarily defence and protection that David needs. His adversaries are the aggressors; he is on the defensive; Saul is hunting him upon the mountains. And stand up for mine help (comp. Psalm 7:6). Standing is the natural posture of one who interposes to help another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDraw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Draw out also the spear; rather, bring out also the spear, since spears were not, so far as is known, kept in sheaths, like swords (Exodus 15:9), but only laid up in an armoury. And stop the way against them that persecute me. So Jarchi, Rosenmuller, Hitzig, Kay, Professor Alexander, Hengstenberg, and our Revisers; but a large number of critics regard סְגר - the word translated \"stop the way\" - as really the name of a weapon, the Hebrew equivalent of the Greek σάγαρις, which was probably the battle-axe. (So Vitringa, Michaelis, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.') The passage will then read, \"Bring out also the spear and the battle-axe against them that persecute me,\" which is certainly a better parallel to \"Take hold of shield and buckler,\" than \"Bring out the spear, and stop the way.\" Say unto my soul, I am thy Salvation. Comfort my soul, i.e., with the assurance that thou art, and wilt ever be, ray Salvation (comp. Psalm 27:1; Psalm 62:2, 6; Psalm 118:14, 21, etc.). Deliverance from the immediate danger is not all that is meant; but rather support and saving help in all dangers and in all troubles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul. It appears from this that David's life is being sought, which only happened at two periods in his career:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) when he was a fugitive from Saul (1 Samuel 19:15 - 26:4); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) during the rebellion of Absalom (2 Samuel 15:13 - 18:8).NEWLINENEWLINEThe psalm therefore belongs to one or other of those periods, most probably to the former (see the introductory paragraph, and note the resemblance between this passage and 1 Samuel 20:1; 1 Samuel 22:23). Let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. Imprecations closely resembling these occur frequently in the Davidical psalms (see ver. 26; Psalm 40:14; Psalm 70:2; Psalm 71:13), and amount to a sort of commonplace, to be used whenever the machinations of his enemies against him are the subject that occupies his thought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Let them be as chaff before the wind (comp. Psalm 1:4; Isaiah 17:13; Isaiah 29:5; Hosea 13:3). Chaff is the type of whatever is light, vain, futile, and worthless; chaff driven before the wind represents the confused rout of a beaten army flying without any resistance before an enemy. And let the angel of the Lord chase them; rather, smite them. The angel of the Lord, who protects the righteous (Psalm 34:7), is called on to complete the discomfiture of the wicked ones, who are David's enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let their way be dark and slippery; literally, darkness and slipperiness; i.e. let them fly along dark and slippery paths, where they cannot see their way, and will be sure to stumble and fall. And let the angel of the Lord persecute them; rather, pursue after them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit; literally, the pit of their net. This is explained by some to mean \"the destruction of their net;\" by others, \"the pit that is covered by a net.\" But neither explanation is altogether saris-factory. Some therefore suppose an accidental transposition of a word. Which without cause they have digged for my soul. \"Without cause\" means \"without provocation on my part.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Let destruction come upon him at unawares; i.e. let the evil happen to him that he designed against others. As he sought to catch others in traps of which they knew nothing (ver. 7), so let an unexpected destruction come upon him. And let his net that he hath hid catch himself (comp. Psalm 9:15, 16; Psalm 57:6; Psalm 141:10). It is the perfection of poetic justice when \"the engineer\" is \"hoist by his own petard.\" Into that very destruction lot him fall; rather, for destruction let him fall therein; i.e. let him not only fall into his own trap, but let his fall prove his destruction. David's imprecations have always something about them from which the Christian shrinks; and this is particularly the case when he asks for his enemies' destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord. A sudden transition from imprecatory prayer to thanksgiving, or rather, to the promise of it - \"My soul shall be joyful;\" i.e. it shall be so when my prayers have been granted. It shall rejoice in his salvation. \"Salvation\" here is, no doubt, especially, deliverance from the immediate danger, but, perhaps, even here, not only that (see the comment on ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee? The \"bones\" here represent, not the frame only, as in Psalm 34:20, but the entire nature. David promises that his whole nature shall bear witness to God's mercy and goodness, proclaiming that there is \"none like unto him\" in these respects, none other that can deliver from danger as he can and does. As Hengstenberg observes, \"He seeks to make the Lord grant the desired help by promising that the help afforded would yield a rich harvest of praise and thanksgiving.\" Which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him? (comp. Psalm 86:1, where David again calls himself \"poor and needy;\" i.e. in want of help and peace and comfort; not absolutely without means, or he would not offer any temptation to the spoiler.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFalse witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-18. - The second part of the psalm begins with a long complaint, David sets forth the woes under which he is suffering. There are:NEWLINENEWLINE1. Calumny (ver. 11).NEWLINENEWLINE2. Ingratitude (vers. 12-14).NEWLINENEWLINE3. Malevolence (ver. 15).NEWLINENEWLINE4. Insult from the vile and base (ver. 16).NEWLINENEWLINEHe then passes to prayer: Will not God rescue him (ver. 17)? In conclusion, he for the second time promises praise and thanks (ver. 18). Verse 11. - False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I know not (comp. Psalm 27:12); literally, malicious, or unrighteous witnesses (see Exodus 23:1). It is not probable that witnesses in a court are intended. David's calumniators accused him privately to Saul of \"seeking his hurt\" (1 Samuel 24:9), and so stirred Saul up against him (1 Samuel 26:19). By what is here said, they appear to have accused him to his face, and to have endeavoured to extort from him a confession of guilt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They rewarded me evil for good (comp. ver. 13). Among those who slandered him were persons with whose troubles he had sympathized, and for whom he had prayed with fasting when they were sick. His worst persecutor, Saul, admitted the charge here made. \"Thou art more righteous than I,\" he said; \"for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil\" (1 Samuel 24:17). To the spoiling of my soul; or, the desolating of my soul. The result of his enemies' machinations against him was to make him a fugitive and a wanderer, to separate him from the friend whom he tenderly loved, from his wife, his parents, and the greater part of his acquaintance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. It is suggested that David had acted thus, especially in the case of Saul, when he was first afflicted with his terrible malady (1 Samuel 16:14-23; 1 Samuel 18:10); but he appears to speak of his habitual practice, whenever any of his friends were sick. (On the putting on of sackcloth as a sign of grief, see Genesis 37:34; 2 Samuel 3:31; 2 Samuel 21:10; 1 Kings 21:27; 2 Kings 6:30; 2 Kings 19:1; Esther 4:1; Job 16:15; Psalm 69:11; Psalm 69:11, etc.) I humbled my soul with fasting. Another customary indication of grief (see Psalm 69:10; Psalm 109:24; Judges 20:26; 1 Samuel 31:13; 2 Samuel 1:12; 2 Samuel 22:16; 1 Kings 21:27; Nehemiah 1:4, etc.). And my prayer returned into mine own bosom (comp. Matthew 10:13). Prayers for others, if prevented by their unworthiness from benefiting them, are yet not altogether void and vain. They bring a blessing to the man that offers them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother. In every such case I sympathized with the sufferer to such an extent, that my conduct was like that of an intimate friend or a brother. I bowed down heavily, as one that mournsth for his mother. Nay, I went further; I took on all those outward signs of grief which are usual when a man has lost his mother. I \"bowed down heavily,\" as though I could scarcely stand. The Orientals are extreme and exaggerated in their manifestations both of joy and grief (see Herod., 8:99).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together; rather, in my fall, or in my halting; \"when I halted\" (Revised Version). \"The word implies a sudden slip and overthrow,\" such as is represented in 1 Samuel 18:8-29. Yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me. Compare the case of Job (Job 30:1-14). It is a matter of common experience that when men fall from a high position into misfortune, the base vulgar crowd always turns against them with scoffs and jeers and every sort of contumely. And I knew it not; rather, and I knew them not; men, i.e., of so low a condition, that I had no acquaintance with them (see the margin of the Revised Version). They did tear me, and ceased not (comp. Job 16:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - With hypocritical mockers in feasts; literally, profane jesters of cakes; i.e. ribald parasites at a great man's table, whose coarse buffoonery entitles them to a share of the dainties; they made me their butt, their jest, and their byword (cf. Job 30:9). They gnashed upon me with their teeth; i.e. spoke fiercely and angrily against me, like dogs that snarl and show their teeth (comp. Job 16:9; Psalm 37:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Lord, how long wilt thou look on? \"How long?\" is the common cry of sufferers (Job 19:2; Psalm 6:3; Psalm 13:1; Psalm 79:5; Psalm 89:46; Habakkuk 1:2; Revelation 6:10), who do not recognize the wholesome discipline of suffering, or realize the fact implied in the phrase, \"No cross, no crown.\" Man desires immediate deliverance; God mostly delays his deliverance until Patience has \"had her perfect work\" (James 1:4). Rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling, from the lions (comp. Psalm 22:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I win praise thee among much people. The promise is repeated (see vers. 9, 10); hut, as before, it is conditional on deliverance being granted, and intended to induce God to grant it, and to grant it speedily.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-28. - The main element of this, the third section of the psalm, is prayer. Complaint finds a voice in vers. 20, 21, and thanksgiving in ver. 28; but with these exceptions, the strophe is one long strain of prayer. The prayer is, first, negative: \"Let not mine enemies rejoice\" (ver. 19); \"Keep not silence\" (ver. 22); \"Be not far from me\" (ver. 22). But after this it becomes mainly positive: \"Stir up thyself, and awake to judgment\" (ver. 23); \"Judge me, O Lord\" (ver. 24); \"Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion that rejoice at my hurt\" (ver. 26); \"Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause\" (ver. 27); \"Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in my prosperity\" (ver. 27). Verse 19. - Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me (comp. Psalm 38:19, where David says that those who \"hated him wrongfully\" were \"multiplied\"). David feels that no one had any reason to hate him, since he had always sought the good of all with whom he came into contact (see ver. 12). Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause; i.e. let them not have cause to wink to each other in self-congratulation on their having triumphed over me completely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For they speak not peace. Once more the language of complaint. David's enemies, though they have driven him from the court, and made him a fugitive and a wanderer, were not yet satisfied. They did not speak him peace. They continued to scheme against him. But they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land. David, if let alone, was willing enough to have remained \"quiet in the land.\" He was a fugitive and an outlaw; but, could he have obtained a safe refuge - the cave of Adullam, or any other - would gladly have remained peacefully within it. But his enemies would not allow him to remain quiet. They stirred up the jealousy and hatred of Saul by false tales, and caused him to be \"hunted upon the mountains\" (1 Samuel 26:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha! our eye hath seen it. They \"opened their mouth wide\" in scornful derision; and shouted triumphantly, \"Ha, ha! our eye hath seen his downfall!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - This thou hast seen, O Lord. Nothing of this has been hid from thee; thine eye, O Lord, has seen it. Therefore I call upon thee. Keep not silence. Refrain not thyself. \"Up, and let not man have the upper hand\" (Psalm 9:19). O Lord, be not far from me. Draw near, hasten, vindicate my name (comp. Psalm 22:19; Psalm 38:21; 70:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment (camp. Psalm 80:2; Psalm 44:23; Psalm 78:65). The psalmists call on God to awake, not as though he were really asleep, but as a sort of stirring appeal to him to arise and manifest himself. Even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. \"Awake,\" i.e., \"to judge my cause - to acquit me, and condemn my enemies\" (camp. Psalm 9:4; Psalm 35:1; Psalm 43:1, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Judge me, O Lord my God, according to thy righteousness, Let thy law of righteousness be the rule by which I am judged, and my enemies also. Then the victory will remain with me; thou wilt not let them rejoice over me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Let them not say in their hearts, Ah! so would we have it (camp. ver. 21); literally, ah! our soul, i.e. \"our heart's desire is accomplished; we have got our wish.\" Let them not say, We have swallowed him up; i.e. destroyed him, ruined him, brought him to an evil end (camp. 2 Samuel 17:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me (camp. ver. 4, of which this is an enlargement, with variations, the sentiment being exactly the same). Very similar maledictions will be found in Psalm 40:14; Psalm 70:2; Psalm 71:13; Psalm 109:29.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause. When David's enemies are \"ashamed and put to confusion\" (ver. 26), his friends will naturally \"shout for joy, and be glad.\" This they will do, partly, out of sympathy; partly because their own interests are bound up with those of their leader. Had Saul captured David when he \"hunted him upon the mountains,\" the fate of David's followers would have been death or exile. Yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant; literally, in the peace of his servant. God desires that David's present troubles should cease, and that he should enjoy a time of rest and tranquillity. This was granted him, to some extent, at Ziklag (1 Samuel 27:4-7), but more fully when he came into his kingdom (2 Samuel 5:1-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm35:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long (camp. vers. 9, 10, and 18). David means to premise perpetual gratitude and thankfulness. He will not merely return thanks publicly, once for all, in the great congregation (ver. 18), but will continue to praise God always.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.36":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart. This is a difficult passage. In the first place, the text is uncertain, since some manuscripts have לבו, \"his heart,\" in the place of לבי, \"my heart.\" And further, whichever reading we prefer, the meaning is far from clear. Dr. Kay translates, \"Transgression's oracle to the wicked is, 'In the interior of my own heart;'\" and understands the meaning to be that the sinfulness of the wicked man deludes him into the belief that his wickedness is known to no one but himself - it is all safely locked up in the recesses of his own heart. Professor Alexander suggests as possible, \"Thus saith depravity to the wicked man, 'In the midst of my heart, there is no fear of God before his (i.e. God's) eyes.'\" Others, preferring לבו to לבי, render, \"Transgression speaks to the wicked within his heart; There is no fear of God,\" etc.; regarding the two clauses as perfectly independent the one of the ether. This is, perhaps, the best explanation. There is no fear of God before his eyes. Either he belongs to the class of \"fools, who say in their heart, There is no God\" (Psalm 14:1), or he agrees with those who cry, \"Tush, God hath forgotten: he hideth away his face; he will never see it\" (Psalm 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. Another very obscure verse, explained in various ways. The rendering of Professor Alexander is to be preferred, \"For he fiattereth himself in his own eyes, as to God's finding his sin and hating it;\" i.e. he flatters himself that he will conceal his sin from God, so that God will not discover it to hate it (see also the comment of Dr. Kay, and the Revised Version)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit (comp. Psalm 12:2; Psalm 28:3). He hath left off to be wise, and to do good. There was a time when he occasionally acted wisely, and did what was right. But that time is gone by. Now he is consistently wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He deviseth mischief upon his bed; rather, he deviseth iniquity - the same word as in the preceding verse. In the night, when he should be looked in innocent slumber, he lies awake, devising wicked schemes against others (comp. Proverbs 4:16; Micah 2:1). He setteth himself in a way that is not good. More correct than the Prayer-book Version, \"He hath set himself in no good way.\" The wicked man is not merely negatively bad; he determinately chooses a path of life that is evil. He abhorroth not evil. He has no aversion to it, no horror of it, no shrinking from it. Whether a thing is right or wrong is to him a matter of complete indifference. So callous is he, so hardened.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens. Instead of the usual contrast between the wicked man and the godly one (Psalm 1:1-6; Psalm 4:2, 3; Psalm 5:10, 11, etc.), the psalmist here makes the startling contrast between the wicked man and God! The character of the wicked man is given in four verses (vers. 1-4), the portrait of God in five (vers. 5-9). God's first and principal characteristic is \"mercy\" - or rather, \"loving-kindness\" (חסר). This quality is revealed, not on earth only, but also in heaven, towards the angels. Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds. Next to loving-kindness in God comes \"faithfulness\" - fidelity to every promise that he has ever made, unswerving attachment to those whom he has once loved, undeviating maintenance of the truth (comp. Psalm 57:10; Psalm 108:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; literally, like the mountains of God; and so Luther, Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version. According to the Hebrew idiom, this means \"the very greatest mountains\" - those which seem to stand the strongest and the firmest. Thy judgments are a great deep; i.e. such as man cannot fathom - unsearchable - past finding out. O Lord, thou preservest man and beast. The providential care of God for his creatures is another of his leading characteristics, and one especially deserving man's attention and gratitude. It is a form of his loving-kindness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - How excellent is thy loving-kindness, O God! The psalmist, having made mention of the \"loving-kindness of God\" as his most characteristic quality (ver. 5), and again brought it into notice as causing him to provide so carefully for all his creatures (ver. 6), cannot refrain from glorifying the quality whereto he has called attention. \"How excellent\" - or, how precious (Kay, Alexander, Cheyne, Revised Version) - \" is thy loving-kindness!\" How does it exceed all that we could have anticipated! How far does it go beyond all that we deserve! Therefore the children of men put their trust (or, shall put their trust, or shall take refuge) under the shadow of thy wings (comp. Psalm 17:8; Psalm 57:1; Psalm 63:7, etc.). Encouraged by the consideration of thy goodness, the beney Adam, the children of weak, frail, sinful man, shall take heart, and lay abide their natural timidity, and turn to thee, and put their trust in thee, gathering themselves under the shadow of thy protecting wings, and looking to thee, and thee only, for safety and defence (see Ruth 2:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house. God will satisfy all who trust in him with \"blessings out of his holy seat,\" and will satisfy them abundantly. The blessings intended are spiritual blessings; and the \"house\" is, primarily, \"the place where God set his name,\" which at this time was the tabernacle. Faithful Israelites were to expect spiritual blessings through faithful attendance on the tabernacle worship, so far as it was accessible to them. The \"house\" typified heaven, whence, of course, the blessings really came. And thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures; literally, the river of thy Edens. Thou shalt give them access to an exhaustless fountain of delight, a stream like that which watered Eden (comp. Isaiah 51:3; Isaiah 55:1; John 4:14; John 7:37, 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For with thee is the fountain of life. The ultimate source of all life is God. Israel had been taught by Moses (Deuteronomy 30:20) that God was their Life; but this was not all; he is equally the Origin of life to everything that lives - to angels, men, beasts, birds, fishes, zoophytes, plants (see Genesis 1:11, 20, 24, 27, etc.). And, as he is the sole Source of natural life, so is he also the one and only Origin of spiritual vitality (Psalm 30:5; Psalm 66:9; John 1:4; John 6:57; John 7:37-39, etc.). And in thy light shall we see light (comp. John 1:4, 5, 9; 1 John 1:5-7). God is essentially Life and Light. He \"has life in himself\" (John 5:26). He \"is Light, and in him is no darkness at all\" (1 John 1:5). The Son, who is \"the Light of the world\" (John 8:12), is but \"the Effulgence of his Father's glory\" (Hebrews 1:3, Revised Version), \"Light of light,\" the ray which streams from the Sun of the universe. Yet from him comes the light which enlighteneth all creatures (John 1:9). \"In his light we see light.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - O continue thy loving-kindness unto them that know thee. Here begins the third strophe. Having finished his\" instruction,\" the psalmist passes on to prayer; and is content to ask that God will be in the future such as he has been in the past - that he will \"lengthen out,\" prolong, or \"continue his loving-kindness\" to his faithful servants, dealing with them as he has hitherto dealt with them (vers. 5, 7), mercifully, graciously, and lovingly. His faithful servants are \"those that know him,\" because, as Hengstenberg observes, \"the true and essential knowledge of God is to be found only in a sanctified mind.\" And thy righteousness to the upright in heart. Continue, i.e., to deal justly with those whose heart is right with thee - who, in spite of occasional lapses, are really in heart sincere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let not the foot of pride come against me. The mention of \"the foot of pride\" is noted as a mark of Davidical authorship. \"Every psalm of David which speaks of danger points to the pride of his enemies as the source\" (Canon Cook). And let not the hand of the wicked remove me; or, drive me away (Revised Version), i.e. force me into exile, as Absalom's party succeeded for a time in doing (2 Samuel 15:13-30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm36:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - There are the workers of iniquity fallen; or, yonder (Kay). It is as if the psalmist suddenly saw a vision. \"There\" - on a spot that presents itself to his eyes - are the wicked actually \"fallen;\" they lie prostrate in the dust. They are cast down, and shall not be able to rise; or, to rise up again (comp. Psalm 18:38). Whereas the righteous may fall into misfortune repeatedly, and recover themselves (Proverbs 24:16), the workers of iniquity, when their time comes to fail, usually perish. At any rate, this would be the result of the overthrow which the psalmist sees in a sort of vision.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.37":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Fret not thyself because of evildoers. According to Aristotle, we have a special emotion implanted in our nature - νέμεσις - which causes us to \"fret\" when we witness undeserved prosperity ('Rhet.,' 2:9, § 1). Certainly the feeling is very common and very strong; it is also characteristic of the best natures (see Psalm 73:3-14; Job 21:7-15; Jeremiah 12:1, 2; Malachi 3:15). The feeling does not need to be eradicated, but only to be held in check. Faith in God's retributive justice will enable us calmly to await \"the end\" (Psalm 73:17), in full assurance that ultimately God's vengeance will overtake the wicked man, and he will receive condign punishment. Neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. Envy is not a natural passion. To envy the evil-doers on account of their prosperity is at once a folly and a danger. Their position is really not enviable; and, if we allow ourselves to envy them, we shall be tempted to follow their example (see Proverbs 24:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For they shall soon be cut down like the grass. So Zophar, in the Book of Job (Job 20:5), \"The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment.\" And, no doubt, if we compare time with eternity, the longest triumph that the wicked ever enjoy is but for a brief space, is soon gone, endures \"but for a moment.\" It has a continuance, however, which to men in this life seems long, often intolerably long; and hence the disturbance which men's minds suffer on account of it (Job 21:7, 13; Psalm 73:3-16). And wither as the green herb (comp. Psalm 90:5, 6; Psalm 103:15; Isaiah 40:6, 7; James 1:10, 11; 1 Peter 1:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Trust in the Lord, and do good. Notwithstanding any difficulty which the prosperity of the wicked causes thee, trust thou still in the Lord; be sure that his providence watches over thee, and endeavour still to serve him by \"doing good.\" So shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed; rather, dwell in the land, and feed on faithfulness (Kay); i.e. remain where thou art, and be satisfied with the thought of God's faithfulness. Feed on this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDelight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Delight thyself also in the Lord. Draw from communion with God all that inward intensity of joy which it is capable of giving. And he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. God will then grant thee all thy desires, and make thee perfectly happy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Commit thy way unto the Lord (comp. Proverbs 16:3; Psalm 22:8). The meaning is, \"Cast thyself and thy life unreservedly upon God - yield thyself wholly to him - look to him for support and guidance.\" Trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. \"He will accomplish all that thy faith has laid upon him\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. If the prosperity of the wicked frets thee, because it seems to obscure thy righteousness, since while he appears to bask in the sunshine of God's favour, thy life is possibly overshadowed by clouds and darkness, be sure that, in the end, this seeming injustice will be remedied. God will not frown on thee always; one day he will turn on thee the light of his countenance, and make thy righteousness to shine forth like the sun in its noonday splendour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Rest in the Lord; literally, be silent; i.e. do not murmur; make no complaint; be silently acquiescent and resigned. And wait patiently for him. Be content to await his time, which is sure to be the right time. Meanwhile possess your soul in patience. Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way (comp. ver. 1, of which this brings out the sense). It is when the ungodly prosper that the righteous are apt to repine. Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. It is the success of the ungodly in their wicked plots and schemes which especially vexes the righteous (see Job 9:24; Job 12:6; Job 21:7-9: 24:2-12; Psalm 72:5-12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; i.e. such anger and such wrath as the prosperity of the wicked calls forth. Fret not thyself in any wise to do evil; rather, fret not thyself, only to do evil. No result could be looked for from the sort of \"fretting\" spoken of, but an evil one. If men will dwell unduly on the fact of the prosperity of the wicked, and brood upon it in their hearts, they will be apt, in the first instance, to envy the wicked, which is at once \"to do evil;\" and from this they will be naturally tempted to go on to an imitation of their wicked practices, which is to assimilate themselves altogether to the enemies of God, and to be guilty of practical apostasy (comp. Psalm 73:2, \"But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh supped. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For evil-doers shall be out off. It is foolish to \"fret\" and rage and storm against the ungodly whom we see prospering, since they will certainly be \"cut off\" sooner or later - sooner rather than later, according to the belief of the writer (see vers. 2, 10). But those that wait upon the Lord (see Ver. 7), they shall inherit the earth. It is doubly foolish, since when the wicked are \"cut off,\" as they will be assuredly some day, the godly will find themselves the inheritors of the earth. This prophecy is partially fulfilled from time to time, and will find its complete fulfilment in the \"new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness\" (2 Peter 3:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be (compare the comment on ver. 2). Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be; or, he shall not be. He shall have been swept away; his \"place shall know him no more\" (Psalm 103:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But the meek shall inherit the earth. This prophecy is endorsed by our Lord (Matthew 5:5). It has only had occasional fulfilment hitherto, notably in Moses, the meekest man of his day (Numbers 12:3); to some extent in St. Louis and other great saints, whose influence has been world-wide, as St. Francis d'Assisi, St. Francis Xavier, St. Carlo Boromeo, and others. And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. Being men of peace, the meek, when they \"inherit the earth,\" will establish universal peace (Isaiah 2:4; Isaiah 11:6-9; Isaiah 65:25; Ezekiel 34:25) and \"delight in the abundance of it\" (comp. Psalm 72:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The wicked plotteth against the just (comp. Psalm 31:13; Psalm 35:4, 7, etc.). Wicked men commonly lay their plots against the righteous, as being less likely to suspect them, and perhaps as less likely to resist their machinations. And gnasheth upon him with his teeth (comp. Psalm 35:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord shall laugh at him (comp.

For he seeth that his day is coming; i.e. God sees that the day of the wicked man's visitation is approaching (see above, vers. 2, 9, 10; and comp. 1 Samuel 26:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The wicked have drawn out the sword, and bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy. David is perhaps thinking especially of his own persecutors, Saul and Absalom, who pursued after him with armed men, and sought his life (1 Samuel 23:8, 14, 26; 1 Samuel 24:2; 1 Samuel 26:2; 2 Samuel 17:24-26; 2 Samuel 18:6-8). But he may also have in his mind the raids that powerful chiefs made upon their weak and peaceful neighbours (Job 24:5-12).

If not slain outright, they shall return from the combats that they have provoked with shattered weapons (ver. 15) and damaged persons. But the Lord up-holdeth the righteous. Their adversaries in the encounters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The Lord knoweth the days of the upright; literally, of the perfect - those who yield him a complete obedience. God takes loving note of their days, knows their number, and the events which each day will bring. He will cause all things to \"work together for their good.\" And their inheritance shall be for ever (comp. vers. 27, 29, and 37; which all, like this verse, point, albeit vaguely, to a future life). The mere continuance of a man's posterity in a prosperous condition cannot exhaust the meaning of such phrases as, \"Their inheritance shall be for ever;\" \"Dwell for evermore;\" \"The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.\" If David himself meant no more than this, yet the Holy Spirit which inspired him may have meant more. At any rate, to the Christian the words will always bring up the thought of that \"inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, which is reserved for us in heaven\" (1 Peter 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They shall not be ashamed in the evil times. If they fall into adversity, it will not cause them to feel shame. They will know that they are not being punished for evil-doing, but that God is trying them and purifying them (Job 36:8-11). And in the days of famine they shall he satisfied (comp. Psalm 33:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But the wicked shall perish (comp. vers. 2, 9, 10, 15, 36); literally, for the wicked shall perish. The happiness of the righteous cannot be complete until the wicked are removed out of their way; since, so long as they continue in the world, they will be ever vexing the righteous and troubling them (Psalm 56:1). And the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs. So, many of the old commentators, as Aquila, Kimchi, and others; and among moderns, Rosenmuller, and Professor Alexander. But the bulk of recent critics translate, as the excellency of the pastures (Hupfeld, Kay, Hengstenberg, Canon Cook, Cheyne, Revised Version); i.e. the rich herbage which is burnt up by the heat of summer (comp. ver. 2). Both translations seem to be tenable; but the latter is perhaps preferable, since the consumption of the fat of lambs upon the altar is connected with the idea, not of rejection, but of acceptance. Into smoke shall they consume away (comp. Psalm 102:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The wicked borroweth, and pay-eth not again. The wicked man borrows with a light heart, though he may have no prospect of ever being able to repay. Living under God's curse (ver. 22), he is for the most part not able to repay; when he happens to be able, he is often not willing. But the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth (comp. Psalm 112:5, 9). The righteous has not often need to borrow (see Deuteronomy 15:6; Deuteronomy 28:12, 44). Rather, he lends and gives freely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For such as be blessed of him (i.e. God) shall inherit the earth (see above, ver. 11). And they that be cursed of him shall be out off (see above, ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; rather, established; i.e. upheld, and made firm. It is not the general superintendence of men's steps and goings by God (Proverbs 16:9; Proverbs 20:24) which is here spoken of; but the special strengthening and supporting of the steps of the pious. The wont גבר must be understood, not of the ordinary man, but of the good man. (\"גבר, viri, scilicet justi, et Jova benedicti,\" Roseumuller). And he delighteth in his way. He \"knows\" it (Psalm 1:6), and looks upon it with favour, and even \"has pleasure\" in it (Psalm 35:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. \"The difference,\" as Hengstenberg observes, \"is that between misfortune or loss, and absolute ruin.\" The good man may be afflicted; he may even fall into some fault (Galatians 6:1) or grievous sin (2 Samuel 11:4); but so long as \"the root of the matter is in him\" (Job 19:28), God will not suffer him to be prostrated. For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand; literally, the Lord supports his hand. If he falls, God (as Luther says) \"catches him by the hand, and raises him up again.\" So David had himself experienced (2 Samuel 12:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I have been young, and now am old. It is most natural to understand this literally, and to gather from it that the psalmist, whether David or another, composed this psalm in advanced life. It has certainly all the gravity, calmness, seriousness, and tone of authority which befit a teacher of many years and much experience. Yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. The social condition of the Israelites was very unlike that of modern European communities. Though there were rich and poor among them, there could scarcely be any that were very poor. Where there was a general obligation upon all well-disposed persons to lend to such as were in need, and no interest could be asked upon loans, and in the year of jubilee all debts were remitted, and mortgaged lands returned to their original owners or their families, actual begging was scarcely possible, and at any rate could only be brought about by extreme and reckless misconduct. Many philanthropists believe that even at the present time in our own country mendicancy is nearly always the consequence of persistence in evil courses. Still more must this have been the case in Palestine in the time of the monarchy (see Proverbs 20:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He is ever merciful, and lendeth (comp. ver. 21). This psalm contains a good deal of repetition, perhaps intended to emphasize certain portions of its teaching (see vers. 1, 7, 8; 3, 27; 11, 22, 29; 7, 34, etc.). And his seed is blessed (comp.

The same injunction is given, in exactly the same words, in Psalm 34:14. And dwell for evermore. This is to be understood as a promise, \"If thou wilt depart from evil, and do good, then thou shalt dwell in the land for ever\" (comp. ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - For the Lord loveth judgment (comp. Psalm 11:7). \"Judgment\" - משׁפט - is here \"justice,\" \"righteousness;\" as in Psalm 33:5; Psalm 99:4; Psalm 103:6, etc. And forsaketh not his saints (see ver. 25; and comp. Isaiah 41:17; Isaiah 42:16, etc.). They are preserved for ever. Something has probably fallen out at the commencement of this line, which ought to begin with the letter ain. But the seed of the wicked shall be out off. The wicked shall perish, not only in their own persons, but in their posterity, who shall be \"cut off from the land of the living\" (Isaiah 53:8), and have \"their name blotted out\" (Psalm 109:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for over (comp. vers. 3, 9, 11, 18, 22, 28, 34; and Proverbs 2:21). Bishop Butler sagaciously remarks that this is the natural tendency of things, if sufficient time be given, and accidental hindrances removed ('Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 4.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom. (On the essential union of wisdom with goodness, see the Proverbs, passim.) And his tongue talketh of judgment; i.e. utters only what is morally right, and,, in accordance with' truth and goodness. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\" A good man out of the good treasure of his heart can only bring forth good things (Matthew 12:34, 35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The Law of his God is in his heart (camp. Deuteronomy 6:6; Psalm 40:8; Psalm 119:11; Isaiah 51:7). None of his steps shall slide. The two facts are associated as cause and effect. The having the Law of God in his heart prevents his sliding or going astray.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him. Wicked men hate righteous men, as being a reproach to them, and also as being a hindrance and a danger. The righteous thwart their plans, oppose their proceedings, often frustrate their counsels. Sometimes their opposition brings the wicked man into peril, as when it takes the shape of prosecution before a court, or of help given to one who has fallen among thieves. Hence the hatred felt by the wicked towards the righteous is not surprising. It leads the wicked to entertain murderous thoughts - to be ever \"watching\" for an opportunity when he may take the righteous man at a disadvantage, and, if no other means of removing him from his path present themselves, kill him. Modern civilization, with its precautions and \"resources,\" prevents actual violence for the most part; but the tour-derous instinct remains, and even now, in his heart, many a wicked man is a murderer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The Lord will not leave him in his hand. God, as a general rule, does not allow the wicked man to work his will upon the righteous. He interposes one cheek or another, and saves the righteous man from destruction. Nor condemn him when he is judged; i.e. nor will he allow him to be condemned when the wicked man brings an accusation against him, and seeks to have him sentenced to death by an ignorant or unjust judge. These promises are not universal nor absolute, since many good men have been assassinated by their enemies, as Abel by Cain; and many have been wrongfully condemned to death and executed, as Naboth at the instigation of Jezebel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Wait on the lord (comp. vers. 2, 5, 7; and Psalm 27:14; Psalm 62:5; Psalm 130:5; Proverbs 20:22). The injunction is repeated so often because of man's extreme impatience and unwillingness to \"tarry the Lord's leisure\" (Prayer-book Version of Psalm 27:16) trustfully and confidently. And keep his way. The way in which he would have them walk - the way of righteousness (comp. ver. 3). And he shall exalt thee to inherit the land (see ver. 29, and the comment ad loc.). When the ungodly are cut off, thou shalt see it (comp. Psalm 52:5, 6; Psalm 91:8). Doubtless with some satisfaction. As the \"ungodly\" spoken of are employed in watching for an occasion to \"slay\" the righteous (ver. 32), these last can scarcely witness their removal from the world by God's providence without a feeling of relief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - I have seen the wicked in great power, and flourishing like a green bay tree; rather, as in the margin, like a green tree in his own (or, his native) soil. Growing, i.e., rankly and luxuriantly, like a leafy shrub, that has never suffered transplantation (comp. Psalm 1:3; Ezekiel 31:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Yet he passed away, and lo, he was not (cf. Job 20:5; Psalm 73:19, 20). Yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. The sudden disappearance of an imposing personality astonishes and confuses us. We cannot believe that one who has played so prominent a part in our drama of life is gone altogether. We look about for him; we expect him to reappear at any moment. We cannot realize the fact that he is vanished for ever. We ask ourselves, \"Where is he?' (Job 20:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright; for the end of that man is peace. This translation is much disputed. Most ancients and many moderns render the first line, \"Keep innocency, and observe uprightness,\" while some critics maintain that acharith in the second line must mean \"posterity,\" and not \"end.\" Others, again, join shalom to ish, and render, \"There shall be posterity (or, a future) to the man of peace.\" However, the rendering of the Authorized Version is retained by our Revisers, and accepted in part by Hengstenberg and Dr. Kay, while it has the complete approval of Canon Cook.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - But the transgressors shall be destroyed together (comp. vers. 2, 9, 10, 15, 20, and 34). The end of the wicked shall be cut off. If achargth be taken to mean \"posterity\" in the preceding verse, it must be given the same signification here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord (comp. Psalm 3:8; Psalm 68:20, etc.). He is their Strength in the time of trouble (see Psalm 18:1; Psalm 46:1, etc.). The last two verses sum up the teaching of the psalm, and indicate its especial object, which was to encourage and sustain the righteous under their trials, by the assurance that they were under the special protection of God, who, whenever trouble threatened, would stand forth as their Strength and Defence, and would ultimately be their \"Salvation.\" The full meaning of this last expression was left obscure, though enough was said to raise the hope that this world was not the end of everything, but rather the beginning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm37:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them; he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. The ground of God's favour towards the righteous, and the ground moreover of their righteousness itself (ver. 3), is their trust in him. Trusting in him, they have taken his Law for their rule of life, and made it their constant endeavour to serve and please him.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.38":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath (comp. Psalm 6:1, where the first of the penitential psalms begins similarly). The prayer is for the cessation of God's wrath, rather than of the \"rebuke\" which has resulted from it. Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure (see the comment on Psalm 6:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For thine arrows stick fast in me. (On the \"arrows\" of the Almighty, see above, Psalm 7:13; and comp. Job 6:4; Psalm 18:14; Psalm 45:5; Psalm 64:7; Psalm 77:17, etc.) It has been maintained that by \"God's arrows\" only sickness is meant (Hitzig); but the contrary appears from Deuteronomy 32:23-25. Hengstenberg is right, \"The arrows of the Almighty denote all the chastisements of sin depending on God.\" And thy hand presseth me sore. The verb used is the same in both clauses; but it is difficult to express both ideas by one term in English. Dr. Kay makes the attempt by translating, \"For thine arrows have sunk deep in me; yea, thine hand sank heavily on me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger. The psalmist begins with a description of his bodily troubles; and, first of all, declares that there is \"no soundness in his flesh,\" i.e. no healthiness, no feeling of vigour, no vital strength. Neither is there any rest in my bones, he says, because of my sin. His bones ache continually, and give him no rest (comp. Psalm 6:2; Psalm 22:14; Psalm 31:10; Psalm 42:10; and Job 30:17, 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For mine iniquities are gone over mine head; i.e. they overwhelm me like waves of the sea. Together with my bodily pain is mingled mental anguish - a sense of regret and remorse on account of my ill-doing, and a conviction that by my sins I have brought upon me my sufferings. As an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. They press me down, crush me to the earth, are more than I can bear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - My wounds stink and are corrupt. The writer reverts to his bodily pains. He has \"wounds,\" which \"stink\" and \"are corrupt;\" or \"fester and become noisome,\" which may be boils, or bed-sores, and which make him a loathsome object to others (comp. Job 9:19; Job 30:18). Because of my foolishness. Because I was so foolish as to forsake the way of righteousness, and allow sin to get the dominion over me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I am troubled; literally, bent; which some take physically, and explain as \"twisted by violent spasms,\" others, psychically, as \"warped in mind,\" \"driven crazy.\" I am bowed down greatly; i.e. bowed to earth, crooked, as men are in extreme old age, or by such maladies as lumbago and rheumatism. I go mourning all the day long. My gait is that of a mourner - I stoop and move slowly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease; my loins are full of burning (Kay, Revised Version). A burning pain in the lumbar region is apparently intended. And there is no soundness in my flesh. Repeated from ver. 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. In concluding his accounts of his physical condition, the writer passes from details to more vague and general statements. He is \"feeble,\" i.e. generally weak and wanting in vigour - he is \"sore broken,\" or \"sore bruised\" (Revised Version), i.e. full of aches and pains, as though he had been bruised all over - and the \"disquietness of his heart\" causes him to vent his anguish in \"roarings,\" or groanings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-14. - In this second strophe the physical are subordinated to the moral sufferings; the former being touched on in one verse only (ver. 10), the latter occupying the rest of the section. Of these the most tangible are the pain caused by the desertion of his \"lovers,\" \"friends,\" and \"kinsmen\" (ver. 11), and the alarm arising from the action taken, simultaneously, by his ill wishers and adversaries (ver. 12). These afflictions have reduced him to a condition of silence - almost of apathy, such as is described in vers. 13, 14. Verse 9. - Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. This has been called \"the first indication of hope in this psalm;\" but there is a gleam of hope in the prayer of ver. 1. Hope, however, does here show itself more plainly than before. The psalmist has laid \"all his desire\" before God, and feels that God is weighing and considering it. He has also opened to him \"all his groanings\" - uttered freely all his complaint. This he could have been led to do only from a conviction that God was not irrevocably offended with him, but might, by repentance, confession, and earnest striving after amendment (ver. 20), be reconciled, and induced to become his Defence (ver. 15) and his Salvation (ver. 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - My heart panteth. This verse, which reverts to the bodily sufferings, seems a little out of place. But Hebrew poetry is not logical, and cares little for exact arrangement. Three more bodily troubles are noticed, of which this is the first - the heart \"pants,\" i.e. throbs, or palpitates violently. My strength faileth me. The strength suddenly fails. As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. The sight swims, and is swallowed up in darkness (comp. Job 17:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; or, from my stroke (comp. Psalm 39:10, where the same word is used). The psalmist feels himself to be \"stricken, smitten of God\" (Isaiah 53:4). He looks for comfort and sympathy to his friends, but they, with a selfishness that is only too common, hold aloof, draw away item him, and desert him (comp. Job 19:13, 14). And my kinsmen stand afar off; or, my neighbours. The stricken deer is forsaken by the rest of the herd (comp. Matthew 26:56, 58).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They also that seek after my life lay snares for me. To the desertion of friends is added the persecution of enemies, who take advantage of the debility and prostration caused by sickness to plot against the writer's life, to \"lay snares for him,\" and devise evil against him. Those who assign the psalm to David suppose the devices described in 2 Samuel 15:1-6 to he referred to. And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long; literally, speak malignity; i.e. calumniate me - bring false accusations against me (comp. 2 Samuel 16:7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But I, as a deaf man, heard not. I took no notice, i.e. I made as if I was deaf. And I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. So far this psalmist, whether David or another, was a type of Christ (see Isaiah 53:7; Matthew 26:63; Matthew 27:14; 1 Peter 2:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs; i.e. I was like a man who is unable to answer, to reprove, or rebuke an adversary. So great was my self-restraint.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For in thee, O Lord, do I hope. Thus I acted, because my hope was in thee. I looked for thy interposition. I knew that thou wouldst \"maintain my right, and my cause\" (Psalm 9:4) in thine own good time and in thine own good way. I said to myself in my heart, Thou wilt hear - or rather, thou wilt answer (Revised Version) - O Lord my God; and I was content to leave my defence to thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me; rather, for I said, I will be silent, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me. I feared lest by answering rashly or intemperately I might give my enemies occasion against me. I knew by experience that, when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. They are always on the watch to catch at any slip on my part, and make it a ground for magnifying themselves and denying me. Hence my silence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For I am ready to halt. I am weak and helpless, liable at any moment to stumble and fall. And my sorrow is continually before me; i.e. my sin, which I sorrow over, which lies at the root of all my distress (comp. Psalm 51:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. The four \"fors,\" beginning four consecutive verses, are somewhat puzzling. Canon Cook suggests that they introduce four reasons for the psalmist's silence (vers. 13, 14) and abstinence front self-justification:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because God hears him, and will make answer for him (ver. 15);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) because, if he spoke, he might give further occasion to his enemies (ver. 16);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) because he feels in danger, and is conscious of sin (ver. 17); andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) because he has no course open to him but confession and contrition. If we are justified in attributing the psalm to David, and in assigning its composition to the period immediately preceding Absalom's rebellion, we must look upon it as opening to us a view of David's condition of mind at that time which is of great interest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong. The psalmist goes back to the thought of his enemies, to whom he has made no answer, and whom he has not ventured to rebuke (vers. 13, 14). He remembers that they are full of life and strength; he calls to mind the fact that they are many in number; he puts on record the cause of their enmity, which is not his sin, but his earnest endeavour to forsake his sin and follow after righteousness (ver. 20); and then, in conclusion, he makes a direct appeal to God for aid against them - first negatively (ver. 21), and then positively in the final outburst, \"Make haste to help me, O Lord my Salvation\" (ver. 22). And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. This suits well the time of Absalom's conspiracy, when day by day more and more of the people forsook David and joined the party of his son. (2 Samuel 15:12, 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries (comp.

Because I follow the thing that good is; literally, because I follow good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Forsake me not, O Lord (comp. Psalm 27:9; Psalm 71:9, 18; Psalm 119:8). God never really forsakes his saints (Psalm 37:28). He withdraws sometimes for wise purposes the sense of his presence and favour, so that they feel as if they were forsaken; but this is only temporary., O my God, be not far from me (comp. Psalm 22:19; Psalm 35:22; Psalm 71:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm38:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Make haste to help me, O Lord my Salvation (see Psalm 22:19; Psalm 31:2; Psalm 40:13; Psalm 70:1; Psalm 71:12, etc.). This so frequent cry always shows imminent peril; or at any rate, a belief in it. The writer here was in danger doubly - from disease and from his enemies. Thus he might well cry out.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.39":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue. There are no grounds for connecting this silence with the abstinence from self-vindication mentioned in the preceding psalm (vers. 13, 14). Indeed, it seems to have had a wholly different origin (see the introductory paragraph). I will keep my mouth with a bridle; i.e. \"curb my impatience, restrain and keep in my speech.\" While the wicked is before me. The Prayer-book Version is better, if less literal, \"While the ungodly is in my sight.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good. Some explain, \"I held my peace, but it did me no good - I was none the better for it\" (Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, Canon Cook); others adopt the Prayer-book Version, I kept silence even from good words\" (Kay, Alexander, Revised Version). And my sorrow was stirred. The pain at my heart was not quieted thereby, nor even lessened; rather, it was roused up, quickened, and aggravated. This is the natural result of repressing any strong feeling.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - My heart was hot within me; or, grew hot (Kay). And while I was musing the fire burned; or, kindled (Revised Version). Then spake I with my tongue; i.e. aloud, articulately. I could not - at any rate, I did not - refrain myself. I burst out in speech, and made my moan to GodNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Lord, make me to know mine end, and the number of my days. This is not exactly the request of Job, who desired to be at once cut off (Job 6:9; Job 7:15; Job 14:13), but it is a request conceived in the same spirit. The psalmist is weary of life, expects nothing from it, feels that it is \"altogether vanity.\" He asks, therefore, not exactly for death, but that it may be told him how long he will have to endure the wretched life that he is leading. He anticipates no relief except in death, and feels, at any rate for the time, that he would welcome death as a deliverer. That I may know how frail I am. So most moderns; but Hengstenberg denies that חדל can ever mean \"frail,\" and falls back upon the old rendering, \"that I may know when I shall cease [to be],\" which certainly gives a very good sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Behold, thou hast made my days as a handbreadth. It seems inconsistent that one who professes to be weary of his life should then complain of life's shortness. But such inconsistency is human. Job does the same (Job 14:1, 2). And mine age is as nothing before thee. The short human existence can scarcely be regarded by God as existence at all; rather, it is mere nothingness. Verily every man living at his best state is but vanity. So our Revisers. But most moderns translate, \"Verily every man living was ordained for utter vanity\" (comp. Psalm 62:9; Psalm 144:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Surely every man walketh in a vain show; literally, in an image, or \"as an image;\" i.e. with a mere semblance of life, but without the reality. Surely they are disquieted in vain. Their restless strivings are to no end, have no result. He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them (comp. Job 27:16, 17; Ecclesiastes 2:18, 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope is in thee. And now - under these circumstances - human life being what it is, and all men nothing but vanity, what is my hope? what is my expectation? what am I waiting for? A cry, as it would seem, of utter despair. But when the night is darkest, day dawns. \"Out of the depths\" comes forth the voice of faith - \"My hope is in THEE!\" There is always hope in God When our father and mother forsake us, the Lord taketh us up. He will not leave us nor forsake us. So the psalmist ends his complaint by throwing himself into the arms of the Divine mercy, and unreservedly submitting himself to God's will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Deliver me from all my transgressions. The approach to God quickens in every God-fearing man the sense of sin and the longing for pardon. So the psalmist has no sooner thrown himself upon God as his one Hope, than the thought of his sin occurs to him - the sin which has brought upon him all his misery; and his first prayer is to be \"delivered\" from it. Make me not the reproach of the foolish. So long as his afflictions continued, the psalmist would be an object of scorn to the fool and the un = godly. He prays, therefore, secondly, that the punishment of his sin may cease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I was dumb, I opened not my mouth (comp. vers. 1, 2). Because thou didst it. The knowledge that my afflictions came from thee, and were the just punishment of my transgressions, helped me to keep the silence which I observed while the ungodly was in my sight.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Remove thy stroke away from me (camp. Psalm 38:11). I am consumed by the blow of thine hand; literally, by the quarrel of thine hand. But our version gives the true meaning. The \"quarrel\" has led the \"hand\" to deal the \"stroke\" by which the sufferer is \"consumed\" or \"wasted away\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity. The calamities which God sends on a man are of the nature of \"rebukes\" addressed to his spirit. They are intended to teach, instruct, warn, deter from evil-doing (see Job 36:8-10). Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth; or, \"thou dost consume, as by a moth, what he prizes;\" i.e. his health, his strength, \"all wherein he has joy and satisfaction\" (Hengstenberg). As a moth corrodes a beautiful garment, so does thy displeasure and heavy hand pressing on him corrode and destroy all which constituted his delight and glory. Surely every man is vanity (comp. ver. 5 ad fin.). This has become a sort of refrain, terminating the second as well as the first part of the psalm (comp. Psalm 107:8, 15, 21, 31; Ecclesiastes 2:1, 11, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26; Isaiah 9:12, 17, 21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears. Tears appeal to the Divine pity in an especial way. \"Weep not!\" said our Lord to the widow woman at Nain; and to Mary Magdalene, \"Why weepest thou?\" He himself offered up his supplications with strong crying and tears\" (Hebrews 5:7); and so his faithful servants (Job 16:20: Psalm 6:6; Psalm 42:3; Psalm 56:8; Isaiah 16:9; Isaiah 38:3; Jeremiah 15:17; Lain. 2:11; Luke 7:38; Acts 20:19). Hezekiah's tears especially moved God to pity him (2 Kings 20:5). For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner. \"Here we have no continuing city\" (Hebrews 13:14), but are \"strangers and pilgrims on the earth\" (Hebrews 11:13). Hence, being so weak and dependent, we may the more confidently claim God's pity. As all my fathers were (comp. Leviticus 25:23, \"The land is mine; ye are strangers and sojourners with me \").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm39:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. The Psalmist, no longer anxious for death, but still expecting it, requests of God, in conclusion, a breathing-space, a short time of refreshment and rest, before he is called on to leave the earth and \"be no more ;\" i.e. bring his present state of existence to an end. Nothing is to be gathered from the expression used as to his expectation or non-expectation of a future life.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Lord, how are they increased that trouble me: rather, Lord. how numerous are they that trouble me! We arc told, in the Book of Samuel, that \"the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom (2 Samuel 15:12), and again, \"Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him\" (2 Samuel 16:15). Ahithophel proposed to attack David with twelve thousand men only (2 Samuel 17:1), but the actual number which went against him must have been far larger, for some twenty thousand men, chiefly, no doubt, Absalom's partisans, fell in the battle (2 Samuel 18:7). Many are they that rise up against me; i.e. \"that rebel against me, and rise up in arras to make war upon me\" (comp. Psalm 18:48; Psalm 44:5; Psalm 59:1, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God.

When Absalom first raised the standard of revolt, there were no doubt many who looked to see some signal Divine interposition on behalf of the anointed king and against the rebel; but when David fled, and with so few followers (2 Samuel 15:18), and in his flight spoke so doubtfully of his prospects (2 Samuel 15:26), and when no help seemed to arise from any quarter, then we can well understand that men's opinions changed, and they came to think that David was God-forsaken, and would succumb to his unnatural foe (comp. Psalm 71:10, 11). Partisans of Absalom would see in David's expulsion from his capital a Divine Nemesis (2 Samuel 16:8), and regard it as quite natural that God should not help him. Selah. There is no traditional explanation of this word. The LXX. rendered it by διάψαλμα which is said to mean \"a change of the musical tone;\" but it is against this explanation that selah occurs sometimes, as here, at the end of a psalm, where no change was possible. Other explanations rest wholly on conjecture, and are valueless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; or, about me(see the Revised Version). (For the sentiment, comp. Genesis 15:1; Deuteronomy 33:29; 2 Samuel 22:3; Psalm 28:7; Psalm 33:20; Psalm 84:9, etc.) The expression has peculiar force in David's mouth, who, as a \"man of war,\" fully appreciated the saving power of a shield. My glory (comp. Psalm 62:7). And the lifter up of mine head. As God had raised up David to the throne (2 Samuel 2:4; 2 Samuel 5:3), and prospered him in his wars (2 Samuel 8:1-14), and exalted him above all the other kings of the period, so he was well able now, if he so willed, to restore him to his place and re-establish him in the monarchy (comp. 2 Samuel 15:25; Psalm 43:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I cried unto the Lord with my voice; rather, I cry unto the Lord with my voice; i.e. earnestly and constantly (comp. Psalm 77:1; Psalm 142:1). And he heard (rather, hears) me out of his holy hill; or. \"the hilt of his holiness\" (comp. Psalm 2:6). Though David is in exile at Mahanaim (2 Samuel 17:24), his thoughts revert to Jerusalem, to the holy hill of Zion, and the ark of God, which he has there\" set in its place\" (2 Samuel 6:17); and he knows that God, who \"dwelleth between the cherubim\" (1 Samuel 4:4), will hear him, though so far off.

I awaked. When morning came, i.e., I awoke, as usual, from quiet and refreshing slumbers. For the Lord sustained me; rather, sustaineth me. Now and always I am sustained by the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people. (On the vast multitude of people that had collected to attack the fugitive king, see the comment on ver. 1.) David, however, did not fear them. Like Asa (2 Chronicles 14:11) and Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc. 3:18), he knew that there was no zeal might in ,' the multitude of an host\" (Psalm 33:16). God could save equally with many or with few, and against many or against few (comp. 2 Kings 6:15-17). That have set themselves against me round about; or, ranged themselves against me (Kay) - a military term (comp. Isaiah 22:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Arise, O Lord (comp. Numbers 10:35; Psalm 7:6; Psalm 9:19; Psalm 10:12; Psalm 17:13; Psalm 68:1). This call is generally made when God's forbearance towards his enemies is thought to have been excessive, and his tolerance of sinners too great. Save me, O my God. David was in imminent danger. \"All Israel\" had come against him (2 Samuel 16:15). He was short of supplies (2 Samuel 17:29). He was doubtful how God was disposed towards him (2 Samuel 15:25, 26). It was a time when, unless God would save, there could be no hope. Hence the intense earnestness of his prayer. For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek-bone. Heretofore, i.e., thou hast always taken my part - thou hast smitten mine enemies, and given me victory over them, and by breaking their jaw-bones thou hast taken away from them all power to hurt (see Psalm 58:6). The reference is, of course, to David's long series of victories, as those over the Philistines (2 Samuel 5:17-25; 2 Samuel 8:1), over Moab (2 Samuel 8:2), over Hadadezer, King of Zobah (2 Samuel 8:3, 4), over the Syrians of Damascus (2 Samuel 8:6), over the Edomites (2 Samuel 8:13, 14), over the Ammonites (2 Samuel 10:7-14), and over the \"Syrians beyond the river\" (2 Samuel 10:16-19). Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly (comp. Job 4:10; Psalm 58:6). The ungodly, enemies alike of David and of God, are represented as wild beasts whose weapons are their jaws and teeth. Let God break these, and they are harmless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSalvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people.

Therefore is my prayer addressed to him, and him only\" (see ver. 7). Thy blessing is upon thy people; rather, let thy blessing be upon thy people. \"Whatever becomes of me,\" i.e., \"let thy people be blest\" (Kay). David is not deterred, by the revolt of almost the whole people against him, from commending them to God, entreating God's blessing upon them, and desiring their welfare. He echoes Moses (Exodus 32:31, 32); he anticipates Christ (Luke 23:34).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.40":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I waited patiently for the Lord; literally, waiting, 1 waited - a common Hebrew idiom, when an idea is to be emphasized. No writer enforces upon us more earnestly than David the duty of awaiting God's pleasure (Psalm 27:14; Psalm 37:7; Psalm 62:1, 5; Psalm 69:3, etc.). And he inclined unto me; literally, bent towards me - an anthropomorphism, but most expressive.

Some imagine a pit with rushing water at the bottom of it, but such pits are scarcely known in Palestine. Others a pit which is filled with noise as a warrior, with crash of arms and amid the shouts of enemies, falls into it. But pits, though used in hunting, were not employed in warfare. The explanation that שׁאון here is to be taken in the secondary sense of \"destruction\" or \"misery,\" seems to me preferable (see the Septuagint, ἐκ λάκκου ταλαιπωρίας). Out of the miry clay (comp. Psalm 69:2, 14). Such \"clay \"would be frequently found at the bottom of disused cisterns. And set my feet upon a rock; i.e. upon solid ground, where I had a firm footing.

Even praise unto our God. Mercy and praise are cause and effect. The deliverance recorded in ver. 2 produces the praise of vers. 3-5. The phrase, \"our God,\" shows us how David instinctively identifies himself with his people. A mercy shown to him is one shown to them. Many shall see it, and fear (comp. Deuteronomy 13:11; Deuteronomy 17:13; Deuteronomy 19:20; Deuteronomy 21:21, where the phrase, \"all Israel shall hear and fear,\" is used of the effect produced by the capital punishment of a high-handed transgressor of the Law). There may be an allusion here to Absalom's end, which was probably followed by a certain number of executions. And shall trust in the Lord; i.e. shall have their faith in God strengthened.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Blessed is that man (rather, the man) that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not the proud; or, turneth not to the proud - does not go over to their party or espouse their principles. Absalom's adherents are probably the persons intended. Nor such as turn aside to lies; i.e. \"prefer falsehood to truth,\" the cause of the ungodly to that of God himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done. It is not only for his recent deliverance (ver. 2) that the psalmist owes thanks and gratitude to God. God's mercies in the past have been countless, and have laid him under unspeakable obligations. And thy thoughts which are to us-ward. God's thoughtfulness for man, his consideration and providential care, deserve praise and thanks equally with his wondrous acts. They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee. They are so numerous that it is impossible to reckon them up. Many of them, moreover, are secret, and escape our notice. If I would declare and speak of them. they are more than can be numbered. Words, therefore, are insufficient; and some better return than mere words must be found.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire. Will the right return be by sacrifices and burnt offerings? No, the psalmist answers to himself; it is not these which God really \"desires.\" Samuel had already preached the doctrine, \"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams\" (1 Samuel 15:22). David goes further. Apart from a spirit of obedience, sacrifice and offering are not desired or required at all; rather, as Isaiah says, they are a weariness and an abomination (Isaiah 1:11, 12). The one thing needed is obedience - a cheerful, willing obedience to all that God reveals as his will. Mine ears hast thou opened. Either, \"Thou hast taken away my deafness, and given me ears open to receive and embrace thy Law;\" or, perhaps, with special reference to Exodus 21:6 and Deuteronomy 15:17, \"Thou hast accepted me as thy voluntary servant, and bored through mine ear, to mark that I am thy servant for ever.\" Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Of the four kinds of offering mentioned in this verse, the first (זבח) is the ordinary offering of a victim at the altar in sacrifice; the second (מנחה), the meat offering of flour, with oil and frankincense accompanying it; the third (עולה) is the \"whole burnt offering,\" representative of complete self-sacrifice; and the fourth (חטאה), the \"sin offering,\" or \"trespass offering,\" of which the special intention was expiation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me; rather, then said I, Lo, I come with the roll of the book written concerning me. \"Then\" means \"as soon as my ears were opened.\" \"Lo, I come,\" marks ready and prompt obedience (see Numbers 22:38; 2 Samuel 19:20). The psalmist represents himself as brining with him \"the roll of the book,\" i.e. the book of the Law in its ordinary form of a parchment roll, to show what it is that he is prepared to obey. This book, he says, is written \"concerning him,\" since it contains precepts concerning a king's duties (Deuteronomy 17:14-20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart.

David has sung the praises of God in the \"great congregation,\" and extolled his righteousness and truth (Psalm 35:18). He has not \"preached,\" in the modern sense of the word, since the preaching office was reserved for the priests and Levites. Lo, I have not refrained my lips; or, I will not refrain my lips. I will continue to glorify thee openly, and praise thy Name while I have my being (Psalm 104:33). O Lord, thou knowest; i.e. thou knowest the truth of my statement as to the past, and the sincerity of my promise as to the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation; I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation. David's psalms furnish a running commentary on these statements. Composed, as appears from the titles, mainly for use in the \"great congregation,\" they set forth the righteousness, faithfulness, salvation, loving-kindness, and truth of God in the strongest possible way. Contemporary Israel, and later Israel, and the Church which has succeeded to the place of the original Israelites, and become \"the Israel of God,\" are alike indebted to him for the wonderful strains in which he has shown forth and magnified these qualities of the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord. The supplicatory portion of the psalm here commences. David beseeches God, whose loving-kindness is so great (ver. 10), not to withhold from him those \"tender mercies\" which he lavishes so freely. As he is bent on \"not withholding,\" or \"refraining,\" his lips (ver. 9), so it is fitting that God should not \"withhold,\" or \"refrain\" (כלא) his kindness. Let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me (compare the last clause of ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For innumerable evils have compassed me about; literally, for evils have gathered upon me until there is no number (comp. vers. 1, 2). The exact nature of the \"evils\" is not mentioned; but the worst of them appears to be \"the deep and bitter consciousness of sin\" revealed in the next clause. Another was, beyond all doubt, the continued animosity of enemies (ver. 14). Mental and bodily weakness may have been added, and have completed the crushing load whereof complaint is made. It is noted that the exceedingly deep consciousness of sin here displayed \"belongs altogether to a late part of David's life\" (Canon Cook). Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; rather, so that 1 am not able to see. An actual failure of sight seems to be intended (comp. Psalm 6:7; Psalm 31:9; 28:10). They are more than the hairs of my head; i.e. they are more in number. Therefore my heart faileth me; i.e. \"my courage\" and \"my strength of mind\" (comp. Psalm 38:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver us. Though one deliverance is just effected (ver. 2), it is not enough; something more is required. The psalmist's life is still threatened by enemies (ver. 14); he is still scoffed at and flouted (ver. 15). O Lord, make haste to help me; literally, Lord, make haste to my help (comp. Psalm 22:19; Psalm 31:2; Psalm 38:22). The Church follows the example set, when she says in her versicles, \"O God, make speed to save us. O Lord, make haste to help us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward, and put to shame, that wish me evil. The remainder of the psalm from this point is detached later on in the Psalter, and becomes a separate psalm - the seventieth. Whether the detachment was the work of David or another, is uncertain. The differences between the two versions are slight (see the comment on Psalm 70.). The present verse repeats almost exactly Psalm 35:4 and 26. It is again repeated, with slight variations, in Psalm 71:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame; rather, by reason of their shame (Kay, Alexander, Revised Version). Let the shame and disgrace that attach to them (ver. 14) cause them to be desolate, or deserted of all. That say unto me, Aha, aha! (comp. Psalm 35:21, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee. The psalmist cannot long be satisfied with mere prayer for self. He must extend his supplication, and make it cover the whole body of the faithful, \"all those that seek God\" (comp. Psalm 25:2, 3, 20-22; Psalm 28:1-9, etc.). Let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified; ie. \"Give them constant occasion to say, and give them the grateful heart to say, The Lord be praised for his mercies\" (comp. Psalm 35:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm40:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But I am poor and needy. David could say this in time of trouble. No one is more in need than a discrowned king, driven from his throne and land, and not yet restored to either (2 Samuel 9:4-20). Yet the Lord thinketh upon me. The \"poor and needy\" are those whom God especially considers (see Psalm 9:18; Psalm 10:12, 17, 18; Psalm 34:6; Psalm 35:10, etc.).

David had concluded the preceding psalm by calling himself \"poor and needy.\" He commences the present one by pronouncing a blessing on all those who \"consider,\" or tenderly regard, and, so far as they can, assist the peer and afflicted. It is not so much actual poverty, as humiliation and weakness, of which he is speaking. The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble; literally, in the day of evil. As he has pity on his fellow-men, so God will have pity upon him (comp.

Continuance in life is always regarded as a blessing in the Old Testament; it is only in the New that to \"depart, and be with Christ,\" is pronounced \"far better\" (Philippians 1:23). And he shall be blessed upon the earth; i.e. his long life shall be a happy one. And thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies; rather, as in the margin, do not thou deliver him (comp. Psalm 27:12; Psalm 74:19). The psalmist changes from dogmatic assertion to prayer, not, however, intending to express any doubt that his prayer will be granted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing. If he falls into a sickness, God will support him through it. Thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness; literally, thou wilt turn all his bed; i.e. rearrange it, turn its cushions, make it such that he can comfortably lie on it (see Kay, who quotes Bellarmine). Others understand, \"Thou wilt change his couch from one of sickness to one of convalescence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I said; rather, as for me, I said. The writer pointedly marks that he turns here from considering the blessedness of the compassionate man to contemplation of his own case - his afflictions and sufferings. Lord, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee. The worst of all his woes - the root and origin of them all - fons et origo mall, is his own sinfulness. Unless that is cured, all other alleviation is vain. Hence, after the first general cry for mercy, he goes to the root of the matter, \"Heal my soul.\" There, within me, in the depths of my nature, is the worst malady. Heal that, and soon all will be well with me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Mine enemies speak evil of me. Another head of suffering, viz. misrepresentation, calumny, abuse, on the part of enemies. Absalom had stolen away the hearts of the children of Israel from David by misrepresenting him (2 Samuel 15:3, 4). Shimei had followed the example, adding to his misrepresentation abuse and cursing (2 Samuel 16:5-8). Absalom's aiders and abettors generally, no doubt, joined in the chorus. This, then, is David's second subject of complaint, and one that he felt keenly - his enemies spoke evil of him. Farther, they desired and anticipated his death. When (they said) shall he die, and his name perish? David evidently was, or had been, when his enemies thus spoke, on the bed of sickness, prostrate, and in danger of his life. While he thus suffered, they rejoiced, expecting his early demise. When he was dead, they intended that his name should \"perish;\" i.e. that his memory should be utterly rooted out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity; rather, he speaketh falsehood (see the comment on Psalm 12:2). It is suggested that Ahithophel is especially aimed at. But there is no proof of this. All the enemies are probably intended, only distributively instead of collectively. His heart gathereth iniquity to itself. Dr. Kay's comment is, \"He makes a show of friendship, using hollow compliments; but he is treasuring up every expression as material for misrepresentation.\" When he goeth abroad, he telleth it. He reports what he has seen and heard, but untruly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - All that hate me whisper together against me; i.e. gather themselves into knots, and hold whispered conversations about me - as conspirators are apt to do. Against me do they devise my hurt; literally, hurt to me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - An evil disease (literally, a thing of Belial), say they, cleaveth fast unto him. (On the meaning of \"Belial,\" see the comment on Psalm 18:4.) The \"thing of Belial\" here intended may, perhaps, be the disease from which David was suffering, but is more probably some disgraceful charge or infamous calumny which had been circulated concerning him, and was now crushing him down. This calumny is represented as poured out upon him like a coating of molten metal (see Job 41:23, 24), and so cleaving to him. And now that he lieth; i.e. \"now that he is prostrate upon a sick-bed.\" He shall rise up no more. He shall not recover, but die of his malady.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Yea, mine own familiar friend (literally, the man of my peace), in whom I trusted. Here Ahithophel is almost certainly intended. He is called \"the man of my peace,\" since he was one of David's official counsellors (2 Samuel 15:12), and consequently on the most friendly terms with him (comp. Psalm 55:13, 14). Which did eat of my bread. At Oriental courts, the king's counsellors, together with many other members of the court, habitually\" eat at the king's table\" (comp. 2 Samuel 9:7-13; 1 Kings 4:23, 27; 1 Kings 18:19; Nehemiah 5:17; Esther 1:10, 11; Esther 3:15, etc.). Hath lifted up his heel against me. (For Ahithophel's defection from David, and share in Absalom's conspiracy, see 2 Samuel 15:12, 31; 2 Samuel 16:15-23; 2 Samuel 17:1-23.) His conduct is here compared to that of a vicious horse, which kicks his own master. (For the relation of type and antitype between Ahithophel and Judas, see John 15:18.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me (comp. ver. 4). The writer passes from complaint to prayer, and once more calls on God to deliver him. And raise me up. Falsify the prediction of my enemies (ver. 8); raise me up from my sick-bed, and re-establish me in a position of authority. That I may requite them. This was not private revenge, but David's duty as a king (Romans 13:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - By this I know that thou favourest me; or, delightest in me (comp. Psalm 18:19; Psalm 22:8; 2 Samuel 15:26). Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. David's enemies had not triumphed over him, and he felt assured that they would not be allowed to triumph. This assurance was so strong that he could make it an argument on which to ground his belief that God\" delighted in him.\" David argues from effect to cause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity (comp. Psalm 26:1, and the comment ad loc.). And settest me before thy face for ever. So that there falls upon me the light of thy countenance (comp. Psalm 4:6). The expression, \"for ever,\" is remarkable in this connection, and may be fairly taken as indicating a hope of immortality (comp. Psalm 16:11; Psalm 17:15; Psalm 23:6; Psalm 30:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm41:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. A similar doxology occurs at the end of Psalm 72, 89, and Psalms 106, not (apparently) as part of the psalm to which it is attached, but as a mark of pause and separation. The Psalter is thus divided into five books (comp. Hippolyt., p. 153, edit. Lagarde, \"TheHebrews divided the Psalter into five books, so that it is another Pentateuch\").NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.42":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - As the hart panteth after the water-brooks. Stags and hinds need abundant water, especially in hot countries, and, in time of drought, may be said, with a slight poetical licence, to \"pant,\" or \"cry\" (Joel 1:20) for it. They are still found in Palestine (Tristram, ' Land of Israel,' pp. 418, 447), though rather scarce. So panteth my soul after thee, O God. The \"panting\" of the soul does not mean any physical action, but a longing desire for a Messing that is, at any fate for a time, withheld.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - My soul thirsteth for God (comp. Psalm 63:1; Psalm 143:6; Isaiah 55:1). The devout soul is always athirst for God. David felt his severance from the tabernacle and its services as a sort of severance from God himself, whom he was accustomed to approach through the services of the sanctuary (see 2 Samuel 15:25, 26). For the living God. This title of God occurs only in one other psalm (Psalm 84:2); but it was a title familiar to David (1 Samuel 17:27). It is first used in Deuteronomy 5:26; and, later, in Joshua 3:10; 2 Kings 19:4, 16; Isaiah 37:4, 17; Jeremiah 10:10; Jeremiah 23:36; Daniel 6:26; Hosea 1:10. It expresses that essential attribute of God that he is \"the eternal Life\" (1 John 5:20), the Source and Origin of all life, whether angelic, human, or animal. When shall I come and appear before God? Appearance in the tabernacle must here be specially meant, but with this David connects his return to God's favour and to the light of his countenance (2 Samuel 15:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? (comp. Psalm 80:9, \"Thou feedest them with the bread of tears;\" and Ovid, 'Metaph.,' 10:288, \"Cure dolorque animi, lachrymaeque, alimenta fuere\" - \"They who grieve deeply do not eat; they only weep;\" yet they live on, so that their tears appear to be their aliment). David's grief at being shut out from God's presence is intensified by the reproaches of his enemies, \"Where is thy God?\" i.e. \"Is he not wholly gone from thee? Has he not utterly cast thee off?\" (comp. 2 Samuel 16:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - When I remember these things; rather, these things I remember - the things remembered being those touched on in the rest of the verse - his former free access to the house of God, and habit of frequenting it, especially on festival occasions, when the multitude \"kept holy day.\" \"Deep sorrow,\" as Hengstenberg remarks, \"tries to lose itself in the recollection of the happier past.\" I pour out my soul in me. \"The heart pours itself out, or melts in any one, who is in a manner dissolved by grief and pain.\" David does not alleviate his sorrow, but aggravates it, by thinking of the happy past. \"Nessun muggier dolore che ricordarsi di tempo felice nella miseria\" (Dante). For I had gone (rather, how I went) with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day (comp. 2 Samuel 6:12-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Why art thou cast down? or, Why art thou bowed down? i.e. brought low - a term indicative of the very extreme of dejection. O my soul. The spirit, or higher reason, rebukes the \"soul,\" or passionate nature, for allowing itself to be so depressed, and seeks to encourage and upraise it. And why art thou so disquieted in me? rather, Why dost thou make thy moan over me? literally, make a roaring noise like the sea (comp. Psalm 46:3; Jeremiah 4:19; Jeremiah 5:22). Hope thou in God (comp. Psalm 33:22; Psalm 39:7, etc.). For I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. Another reading assimilates the refrain here to the form which it takes in ver. 11 and in Psalm 43:5. But, as Hengstenberg observes, Hebrew poets, and indeed poets generally, avoid an absolute identity of phrase, even in refrains (see Psalm 24:8, 10; Psalm 49:12, 20; Psalm 56:4, 11, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - O my God, my soul is cast down within me; or, bowed down, as in the first clause of ver. 5. Therefore will I remember thee. As a remedy for my depression, I will call thee to mind, and cast myself on thee. From the land of Jordan. From the place of my present abode - the Trans-Jordanic region - to which, on the revolt of Absalom, David had fled (2 Samuel 17:24). And of the Hormonites; rather, and of the Hermons. This expression is not elsewhere used, and can only be explained conjecturally. It probably means the mountain ranges which, starting from Hermon in the north, extend in a southerly direction down the entire Trans-Jordanic territory. From the hill Mizar. This name occurs nowhere else; and can be assigned to no special locality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts. Blow follows blow. Misfortunes \"come not in single file, but in battalions.\" The imagery may be taken from the local storms that visit the Trans-Jordanic territory (see Lynch, 'Expedition to the Jordan and the Dead Sea;' and Wilson, 'Negeb,' pp. 26, 27). All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me (comp.

Notwithstanding all these present woes, God wilt at some time \"command\" his loving-kindness to make itself apparent (comp. Psalm 44:4; Psalm 68:28), and both \"in the daytime\" and in the night will so comfort me that his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life; i.e. I shall offer him both praise and prayer continually both day and night (Psalm 92:2) for his great mercies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will say unto God my Rock (comp. Psalm 18:1; Psalm 31:3). Why hast thou forgotten me? (see the comment on Psalm 13:1). God does not forget even when he most seems to forget (comp. Psalm 9:12; Psalm 37:28). As the event showed, he had not now forgotten David (see 2 Samuel 19:9-40). Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? Why am. I allowed to remain so long an exile, sorrowing and oppressed (comp. Psalm 43:2)? Even to repentant sinners God's judgments are apt to seem too severe, too much prolonged, too grievous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me. The reproaches of his enemies were as daggers struck into his bones; or, according to others, as blows that crushed his bones (LXX.). So keenly did he feel them. The worst of all was that they could say daily unto him, Where is thy God? What has become of him? Has he wholly forsaken thee (see above, ver. 3)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm42:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Why art thou cast down (or, bowed down), O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me! hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him. Thus far is identical with ver. 5; but what follows is slightly different: who is the health of my countenance, and my God, instead of \"for the help (health?) of his countenance.\" Most commentators assimilate the text in ver. 5 to that of the present verse, which can be effected by a mere alteration of the pointing; but Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and others regard the variant forms as preferable.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.43":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm43:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Judge me, O God (comp. Psalm 35:24). And plead my cause. (comp. Psalm 35:1). God's intervention is asked in the struggle between David and his enemies, on the assumed ground that he is in the right, and not they. God will, of course, only interpose if this is so. Against an ungodly nation; or, an unkind, unloving nation. Though called גוִי, as in Isaiah 1:4, still Israel is meant. They were \"unloving,\" both towards God and towards their king. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

Why dost thou cast me off? An equivalent to the \"Why hast thou forgotten me?\" of Psalm 42:9. Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

Both words equally signify God's favour. Let them lead me. As the pillar of fire and of the cloud led the Israelites into the promised land, so let God's \"light and truth\" now lead David back to Jerusalem and God's \"holy hill of Zion.\" Let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles; or, thy dwelling-place. In his exile it was David's most earnest desire to revisit the tabernacle which he had set up on Mount Zion, where God's presence dwelt, and prayer was most acceptably offered (see 2 Samuel 15:25; Psalm 42:2). He had made his being brought back to it a test of the return of God's favour (2 Samuel 15:25, 26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm43:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Then will I go unto the altar Of God.

Yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God. The psalmist has before him some such scene as that depicted in 2 Samuel 6. and 1 Chronicles 15:25-29, where, amid shouts and singing and dancing, and \"with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, with psalteries and harps,\" a joyful procession approached the tabernacle, David himself taking part in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm43:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. The refrain of Psalm 42:11 is here repeated totidem verbis; and the plaint of the exiled monarch is brought to an end. The burden of the refrain is hope and confidence.

God has recently dealt with Israel exceptionally - has seemed to \"cast them off,\" has \"put them to shame,\" allowed them to be defeated and despoiled, slain and carried into captivity, made a scorn and a derision, a reproach and a byword. He no longer \"goes forth with their armies,\" to secure them victory over their foes, but holds aloof, and covers them with confusion. The description implies, not a single defeat, but a somewhat prolonged period of depression, during which several \"armies\" have been beaten, several battles lost, multitudes slain, and great numbers carried away captive (ver. 11). Still, a general captivity, like the Babylonian, is certainly not spoken cf. The nation is as yet unconquered. It needs but a return of God's favour to turn the vanquished into the victors, and to replace shame by boasting. Verse 9. - But thou hast cast off (comp. Psalm 43:2) and put us to shame (see also ver. 16). It is the shame of defeat, rather than the physical pains or material losses, that grieve the writer. And goest not forth with our armies. Israel has still \"armies\" at her disposal. It is therefore certainly not the early Maccabean period, nor the time of the expiring monarchy. Her armies have free play, are sent forth, only God does not \"go forth\" with them (comp.

They would be reproached, not so much as cowards, or as weak and powerless themselves, but rather as having a weak and powerless God (comp. 2 Kings 18:33-35; 2 Kings 19:12). A scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. (For instances of the \"scorn and derision\" whereto the Israelites were exposed at the hands of the heathen, see 2 Kings 18:23, 24; 2 Kings 19:23, 24; Nehemiah 2:19; Nehemiah 4:2, 3; Psalm 79:4; Psalm 137:7.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou makest us a byword among the heathen (comp.

Psalm 22:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me (see the comment on ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For the voice of him that re-proacheth and blasphemeth. The reproaches of the heathen were most commonly \"blasphemies,\" since they consisted very mainly of contemptuous expressions against the God of Israel (see the comment on ver. 13; and comp. Isaiah 37:3, 23). By reason of the enemy and avenger. The persons by whom the blasphemous reproaches were uttered - Israel's enemies bent on avenging former losses and defeats.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-22. - In this third stanza the psalmist strongly emphasizes his complaint by maintaining that the calamities from which they are suffering have not come upon the people through any fault of their own, or been in any way provoked or deserved He is, perhaps, over-confident; but we cannot doubt that he is sincere in the belief, which he expresses, that the people, both before and during their calamities, have been obedient and faithful to God, wholly free from idolatry, and exemplary in their conduct and life. There are not many periods of Israelite history at which such a description could have been given without manifest untruth, and the time of David is certainly more suitable for it than almost any other. Verse 17. - All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Israel had neither put aside the thought of religion, and given herself up to wordliness, nor yet, while still professedly religious, transgressed habitually God's commandments. She maintained \"thorough sincerity in religion, and consistent integrity of life.\" Yet \"all this\" - all that has been described in vers. 9-16 - had come upon her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Our heart is not turned back; i.e. turned away from God, as it was when they passed through the wilderness (Psalm 78:41). Neither have our steps declined from thy way. Neither in respect of inward feeling nor of outward act have we strayed from the right path.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons; rather, in the place of jackals; i.e. in wild and desolate regions, where jackals abound (comp. Isaiah 13:22; Isaiah 34:13). The expression is probably used metaphorically. And covered us with the shadow of death. Brought us, i.e., into imminent peril of destruction (see vers. 10, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out (rather, spread out) our hands to a strange god. If Israel had either forgotten the true God (see above, ver. 17) or fallen away to the worship of false or strange gods - then her ill success against her foreign enemies would have been fully accounted for, since it would only have been in accordance with the threatenings of the Law (Leviticus 26:14-17; Deuteronomy 28:15-23); but as she had done neither of these things, her defeats and depressed condition seemed to the psalmist wholly unaccountable. We trace here the same current belief, which comes out so strongly in the Book of Job - the belief that calamities were, almost of necessity, punishments for sin; and that when they occurred, and there had been no known precedent misconduct, the case was abnormal and extraordinary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Shall not God search this out! i.e. visit for it - punish it. Such a result was to be expected. But when there had been no precedent idolatry, no neglect of the worship of Jehovah, what then? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Secret idolatry would, of course, explain the state of things; but the writer evidently knows of no secret idolatry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; or, continually, as the phrase is often translated. Not only are the Israelites not suffering on account of any previous desertion of God, or other misconduct, but they are suffering for their fidelity to God. The heathen hate them, and make war upon them, as worshippers of one exclusive God, Jehovah, and contemners of their many gods, whom they hold to be \"no-gods.\" They are martyrs, like the Christians of the early Church (see Romans 8:36). We are counted as sheep for the slaughter (comp. ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAwake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-26. - The appeal to God is now made, after the case has been fully represented. God has always hitherto maintained the cause of his people, and given them victory over their enemies, unless they had fallen away from him (vers. 1-8). Now he has acted otherwise - he has allowed their enemies to triumph (vers. 9-16). And they have given him no reason for his desertion of them (vers. 17-22). Surely, if they call upon him, and plead their cause before him, he will relent, and come to their aid. The appeal, therefore, is made briefly, but in the most moving terms. Verse 23. - Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? The psalmist does not really believe that Jehovah \"sleeps.\" The heathen might so imagine of their gods (1 Kings 18:27), but not an Israelite. An Israelite would be sure that \"he that keepeth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps\" (Psalm 121:4). The writer consciously uses an anthropomorphism, really intending only to call on God to rouse himself from his inaction, and lay it aside, and come to Israel's aid. Arise (see Psalm 7:6; Psalm 9:19; Psalm 10:12, etc.). Cast us not off for ever (comp. ver. 9). Under the existing peril, for God to cast off his people will be to cast them off for ever. They had no strength of their own that could save them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Wherefore hidest thou thy face (comp.

(see Psalm 13:1; Psalm 74:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - For our soul is bowed down to the dust; i.e. brought very low, humbled, as it were, to the earth, so weakened that it has no strength in it. Our belly cleaveth unto the earth. The body participates in the soul's depression, and lies prostrate on the ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm44:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Arise for our help; literally, arise as a help unto us; i.e. arise, and come to our aid. Help against the enemy is the one object of the entire prayer. And redeem us; or, save us - \"deliver us\" (comp. Psalm 25:22). For thy mercies' sake (comp. Psalm 6:4; Psalm 31:16).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.45":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - My heart is inditing a good matter; literally, bubbleth with a good matter - is so full of it that the matter will burst forth. I speak of the things which I have made touching the king; or, I utter that which I have composed concerning the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. It is noted that only \"psalms of high and solemn import\" have formal exordia of this kind, announcing the intention of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou art fairer than the children of men. It has been argued that a description of the Messiah would not lay stress on his personal beauty. But in the Song of Songs the personal beauty of the bridegroom, whom so many critics regard as the Messiah, is a main point (Song of Solomon 5:10-16). A perfect man, such as Messiah was to be, must needs be beautiful, at any rate with a beauty of expression. In calling his bridegroom \"fair beyond the sons of men,\" the writer at once gives us to understand that he is not a mere man. Grace is poured into thy lips; rather, grace is poured out on thy lips (Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Kay). The gift of gracious expression and gracious speech has been poured upon him from on high (comp. Song of Solomon 5:16, \"His mouth is most sweet\"). Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. The gifts bestowed upon him show the Divine favor and blessing, which, once granted, are not capriciously withdrawn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty; i.e. array thyself as a warrior, for thou wilt have enemies to conquer, and wilt need a sword against them (see vers. 4, 5). With thy glory and thy majesty. There is no \"with\" in the original. Some think his sword is called Messiah's \"glory and majesty.\" Others supply \"put on,\" as implied in the \"gird\" of the first clause, and translate, \"Put on thy glory and thy majesty;\" i.e. show thyself in all the majesty and glory that naturally belong to thee. This is quite in accordance with the context.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And in thy majesty ride prosperously; literally, and in thy majesty go forth, ride. The riding intended is probably riding in a chariot. Because of truth and meekness and righteousness; rather, because of truth and meek-tempered righteoushess (Kay); i.e. for the purpose of vindicating truth and righteousness in the case of those who outrage them. Righteousness, however, to be really righteousness, must be combined with meekness (comp. Zephaniah 2:3). And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. It is the right hand wherewith the warrior strikes; and at each blow it opens to the striker terrible experiences, and thus may be said to \"teach him terrible things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee. The original is more graphic. It runs, \"Thy arrows are sharp - the peoples fall under thee - (they are) in the heart of the king's enemies.\" All the enemies of Messiah shall one day be chastised, and fall before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thy throne, O God. So the LXX., the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 1:8), the Chaldee paraphrase, and, among critics, Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and Canon Cook. The renderings proposed by Gesenius, Ewald, and the anti-Messianic school generally are wholly untenable, as Hengstenberg has clearly shown. The psalmist's intention is to address the King, whom he has already declared to be more than man (ver. 2), as \"God.\" Is for ever and ever. A dominion to which there will never be any end. This is never said, and could not be truly said, of any earthly kingdom. When perpetuity is promised to the throne of David (2 Samuel 7:13-16; Psalm 89:4, 36, 37), it is to that throne as continued in the reign of David's Son, Messiah. The sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre; literally, a sceptre of rectitude (comp. Psalm 67:4; Psalm 96:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness, therefore, etc. God will only commit rule and authority over his Church to one who will rule justly - one who loves righteousness and hates iniquity. Messiah is alone perfect in righteousness, and therefore entitled to rule. Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. Some moderns translate, \"Therefore, O God, thy God hath anointed thee,\" etc.; but the rendering of the Authorized Version is maintained by Dr. Kay, Professor Alexander, and our Revisers. The anointing intended is that outpouring of glory and blessedness on Messiah which followed upon his voluntary humiliation and suffering (comp. Philippians 2:9; Hebrews 2:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia; literally, myrrh and aloes [and] cassia are thy garments. The \"and\" before \"cassia\" appears in four manuscripts, and in all the ancient versions. The garments are so impregnated with spices as to seem made of them. Out of the ivory palaces. \"Ivory palaces\" are mentioned in 1 Kings 22:39 and Amos 3:15. We must understand \"palaces adorned with ivory.\" Whereby they have made thee glad. So Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Alexander, and others. But most moderns render, \"Out of the ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - King's daughters were (rather, are) among thy honourable women. The marriage scene now begins to open upon us. The bridegroom has been depicted in all his glorious majesty. The bride has now to be brought forward. She comes, accompanied by a train of attendants - \"honourable women,\" or, noble ladies\" (Kay), many of whom are \"kings' daughters\" (comp. 1 Kings 7:3). It must not be expected that all the details of the scene shall have exact equivalents in the spiritual marriage which it represents. Upon thy right hand did stand (rather, stands) the queen in gold of Ophir; i.e. in a vesture richly embroidered with gold thread (comp. Exodus 28:5-8). \"Gold of Ophir\" was known, not merely to David (1 Chronicles 29:4), but even to Job (Job 28:16). The \"right hand\" of the king was the place of honour. We find it assigned by Solomon to the queen-mother, Bathsheba (1 Kings 2:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear. The psalmist, having introduced the bride to our notice in ver. 9, proceeds to address her, and to describe the glories of her person and of her entourage. First of all, he bids her \"hearken,\" \"consider,\" and \"incline her ear,\" i.e. reflect deeply on the new relation in which she is about to be placed, the new sphere which she is entering, the new duties which she will have to discharge. She must give herself wholly to her Lord and Spouse; she must have no thought for any one but him. Forget also thine own people, and thy father's house. She must break with all associations and bends and relationships that would separate between her and her King, forget the past in the present, cease to Judaize, and be wholly Christ's.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty. Devotion to her Lord will win her his tender regard, and make her other charms and graces please and delight him. For he is thy Lord; i.e. thy Lord and Master, entitled to thy utmost love and obedience, nay, to thy \"worship \" - therefore, Worship thou him. Worship, in a certain sense, is due from every wife to every husband; but the Church's worship of Christ is worship in the absolutely highest sense (Revelation 5:6-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the daughter of Tyro shall be there with a gift. Heathen nations shall be attracted to Christ and his Church, shall bring their offerings, and make submission, and humbly sue for favour. Tyro is taken as a type of heathen states and cities generally (comp. Isaiah 49:18-23; Isaiah 56:6-8; Isaiah 60:3-14). Even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

The \"King's daughter \"of this passage can be no other than the bride herself - the\" queen\" of ver. 9. As among her attendants some were \"kings' daughters\" (ver. 9), so she could be no less. She is \"glorious,\" not only without, in her robe of\" gold of Ophir,\" but also and especially within - in the inner chamber of the heart - where she is indeed \"glorious,\" through the sanctifying presence of God's Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:26, 27). Her clothing is of wrought gold (comp. ver. 9, and the comment ad lee.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework; i.e. in garments richly embroidered. Such were known to the Hebrews from the time of the Exodus (Exodus 28:4, 39), and were worn by princeases in David's day (2 Samuel 13:18). Brides were commonly \"led\" into the presence of the bridegroom. The virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee (comp. ver. 9). A virgin train follows the bride as she is led to the palace of the bridegroom, for a royal bride necessarily had her attendants. These symbolize the Gentile converts that should attach themselves to the original Church, and follow that Church into Christ's presence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought.

They shall enter into the king's palace; i.e. be received into the heavenly dwelling-place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInstead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children. In conclusion, the psalmist once more addresses the bridegroom. \"Instead of thy fathers\" according to the flesh - the princes of the royal house of David\" thou shalt have children\" sons still more conspicuous - apostles, martyrs, confessors - a glorious and goodly company. Whom thou mayest make princes; i.e. rulers and governors of the Church - in all the earth (comp. 1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6; Revelation 5:10; Revelation 20:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm45:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations. I, the psalmist, with my \"pen of a ready writer,\" will so sing thy praise that thy name shall always he had in remembrance; and therefore - because of my words - shall the peoples - i.e. all the nations of the earth - praise thee for ever and ever. There is here, mixed with the praise of Messiah, a certain amount of self-glorification; but perhaps the \"son of Korah,\" who had composed so noble a poem, may be excused for somewhat \"vaunting himself.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.46":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - God is our Refuge and Strength (comp.

A very present Help in trouble; literally, a very accessible Help - one easy to be found (comp. 2 Chronicles 15:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed; or, though the earth change - a somewhat vague expression, probably to be understood of political changes and revolutions (see ver. 6). And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; rather, and though the mountains be hurled into the heart of the seas. A metaphor for still more strange and violent disturbances and commotions. The revolutions and disturbances intended are probably those caused by the Assyrian career of conquest briefly described in Isaiah 10:5-14; Isaiah 37:18-27, and fully set forth in the annals of the Assyrian kings (see G. Smith's 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 106-149; and the author's 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 83-210).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof.

In contrast with the scene of tumult and disturbance in the world at large, which the writer has presented to us in vers. 2, 3, he now shows us, resting in perfect peace and tranquillity, \"the city of God,\" threatened, indeed, by the nations, but undismayed by them, and calmly trusting in the protection of the God who is \"in the midst of her.\" To this city he assigns a \"river, the streams whereof make her glad;\" imagery in which we may recognize the perennial fountain of God's grace - that \"pure river of water of life,\" which, welling forth from the throne of God and of the Lamb, continually refreshes and gladdens the Church of Christ (Revelation 22:1), whether her dwell-tug-place be the earthly or the heavenly Jerusalem. The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High (comp. Psalm 43:3). The direct application is, of course, to the earthly Jerusalem, which the armies of Sennacherib were threatening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved. While the world is being turned upside down (vers. 2, 3, 6), the Church is unmoved - since \"God is in the midst of her.\" God shall help her, and that right early; literally, at the turning of the morning, or, in other words, \"at the break of day\" (comp. Psalm 30:6; Psalm 49:14; Isaiah 17:14). The deliverance of Israel from Sennacherib came, it is to be remembered, when it was discovered \"early in the morning\" that in the camp of the Assyrians were 185,000 \"dead corpses\" (2 Kings 19:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted (comp. vers. 2 and 3). The past tenses arc probably the \"preterite of prophetic certainty.\" The writer foresees and announces the destruction of Israel's enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The Lord of hosts is with us (comp. 2 Chronicles 15:2; 2 Chronicles 20:17; Isaiah 8:8, 10). This is the ground of assurance. Our God, Jehovah, is \"the Lord of hosts\" - one who has countless angels at his command (2 Kings 6:16, 17; Psalm 68:17; Matthew 26:53). And he is \"with us\" - on our side, ready to help. The God of Jacob is our Refuge; i.e. our covenant God, the God who entered into covenant with our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. The deliverance of Israel from its peril is effected by \"desolations\" or \"devastations,\" which God accomplishes among the nations. The announcement is very vague and general, so that it would apply to almost any occasion when the people of God were delivered from a pressing peril.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth (comp. Isaiah 2:4; Isaiah 11:9; Isaiah 65:25). Each great deliverance effected by God is followed naturally by a term of peace (comp. Judges 3:11, 30; Judges 5:31; Judges 8:28; \"and the land had rest twenty, forty, eighty years\"), each such term being typical of the final peace, when God shall have put down all enemies under Messiah's feet. He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; i.e. he destroys all offensive weapons, so that none may \"hurt or destroy in all his holy mountain\" (Isaiah 11:9). He burneth the chariot in the fire. War-chariots were largely employed by the Assyrians, and formed the main strength of the army of Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm46:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Be still, and know that I am God (comp. Exodus 14:13, 14; 2 Chronicles 20:17; Isaiah 30:15). As a general rule, God requires man to cooperate with him. \"We are fellow-workers with God.\" \"Aide-toi, le ecel t'aidera.\" But there are occasions when man must stand aloof, and all must be left to the almighty Disposer of all things. The invasion of Sennacherib was such an occasion. Human effort could not but be futile; and unless God gave deliver-ante in some strange and extraordinary way, there was no hope of escape: Judaea must cease to exist as an independent country. I will be exalted among the heathen. When a deliverance was plainly miraculous, the God of Israel got him special honour among the neighbouring heathen nations, who could not gainsay the fact that there had been a supernatural interposition (comp.

Deuteronomy 7:21; and see also Psalm 65:5; Psalm 68:35; Psalm 76:7-9). God is \"terrible\" - i.e. awful to contemplate-on account of his vast power and his absolute holiness. He is a great King over all the earth. Not only over Israel, or over the nations which David has conquered, but ever every nation on the face of the earth (comp.

The reference is to recent victories (comp. Psalm 18:47). And the nations (rather, and nations) under our feet. David subdued all the nations between the river of Egypt and the Euphrates, and left the inheritance of this kingdom, or rather empire, to Solomon (1 Kings 4:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm47:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He shall choose our inheritance for us; rather, he chooseth, or hath chosen, our inheritance for us. God originally chose Canaan as the inheritance of his people (Genesis 12:1-7), and gave it to Abraham. Later on, he enlarged the gift, making the boundaries such as they became under David and Solomon (Genesis 15:18). The excellency of Jacob whom he loved. The Holy Land is called \"the excellency of Jacob,\" or \"the pride of Jacob,\" on account of its beauty, and the excellence and variety of its productions (see Deuteronomy 8:7-9; 2 Kings 18:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm47:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - God is gone up with a shout; the Lord with the sound of a trumpet. As God \"comes down\" when he interposes for the relief or deliverance of his people (Psalm 144:5), so after the relief or deliverance is effected, he is viewed as \"going up\" - returning to his glorious abode, reoccupying his seat in the heaven of heavens, and there remaining until some fresh call is made upon him. If the interposition has been one of a striking and unusual character, if the relief has been great, the deliverance signal, the triumph accorded to his people extraordinary, then he \"goes up with a shout\" - amid the exulting cries and loud jubilations of rescued Israel. When the occasion is such as to call for a public manifestation of thanksgiving at the house of God (2 Chronicles 20:28), then he \"goes up\" also \"with the sound of the trumpet,\" which was always sounded by the priests on great occasions of festal joy and gladness (see 2 Samuel 6:15; 2 Kings 11:14; 1 Chronicles 13:8; 1 Chronicles 16:42; 2 Chronicles 5:12; 2 Chronicles 7:6; 2 Chronicles 29:27; Ezra 3:10; Nehemiah 12:35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm47:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises Praise him, i.e., both as God and King - especially as \"our King\" - that is, as Israel's King.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm47:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For God is the King of all the earth (comp. ver. 2). Sing ye praises with understanding; literally, sing a psalm of instruction. As Hengstenberg remarks, \"Every song in praise of God, on account of God, on account of his glorious deeds, contains a rich treasure of instruction and improvement.\" Here the special instruction is that God is King over the whole earth, that he reigns over the heathen, and that the heathen shall also some time or other own his sovereignty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm47:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - God reigneth over the heathen. God had manifested his kingly power over the heathen by subduing great numbers of them, and making them subject to Israel. He would one day manifest it still more by bringing all nations into his Church. God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. The throne from which he exercises a just, a righteous, and a holy rule.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm47:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The princes of the people (literally, princes of peoples) are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham; rather, to be the people of the God of Abraham (Revised Version) - i.e. to form, together with Israel, the one people, or Church, of God (comp. Isaiah 49:18-23). For the shields of the earth belong unto God. The \"shields\" are the \"princes\" of the first clause, those whose business it is to protect and defend their subjects (comp. Hosea 4:18). The princes of the earth belong especially to God, since \"by him kings reign, and princes decree justice\" (Proverbs 8:15). At the great ingathering of the Gentiles into the Church, they would belong to him still more, since they would voluntarily place themselves under his rule (Isaiah 49:23; Isaiah 60:3, 11, 16). He is greatly exalted. The perfect submission to God of all his rational creatures is his highest exaltation and glory. When \"all people bow down before him,\" and \"all nations do him service,\" when rebellion and resistance to his will are at an end, then will he be established in his rightful position, and his exaltation will be complete.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.48":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; rather, great is the Lord, and greatly is he praised. The psalmist speaks of what is, not of what ought to be. Jehoshaphat had solemnly praised God for the deliverance from the Moabites and Ammonites, both in the valley of Berachah, when he came upon the bodies of the slain (2 Chronicles 20:26), and in the temple after his return to Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 20:28). In the city of our God (comp. Psalm 46:4; Psalm 101:8). In the mountain of his holiness. The \"holy hill of Zion\" (Psalm 2:6), on which the temple and a great part of the city stood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Beautiful for situation; literally, for elevation; i.e. in respect of its lofty position. \"Jerusalem, above all other great capitals,\" says Professor Cheyne, \"is a mountain city.\" \"It is a glorious burst,\" says Canon Tristram, \"as the traveller rounds the shoulder of Mount Olivet, and the Haram wall starts up before him from the deep gorge of the Kedron, with its domes and crescents sparkling in the sunlight - a royal city\" ('Land of Israel,' pp. 111, 112). The joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion (comp. Romans 2:15). The psalmist writes as a devout Israelite. To him there is nothing in the world so lovely, nothing so gladdening, as Mount Zion and the holy city seated on it. He does not mean to say that all the earth felt as he did; though he may have thought that, if men were wise, they would so feel. On the sides of the north. Professor Cheyne regards this clause as a gloss which has crept into the text. Others give a mystical interpretation founded on Isaiah 14:15. But the simplest explanation seems to be the best. Zion, the city of David, lay to the north of the temple, and abutted on the city's northern wall. The city of the great King (comp. ver. 1, \"the city of our God\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod is known in her palaces for a refuge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - God is known in her palaces for a Refuge; or, in her castles.

The sight of the city, with its walls and towers (vers. 12, 13), was enough for them - they recognized that the place was too strong to be attacked with any prospect of success; \"marvelled,\" or \"were amazed\" (Cheyne), at its strength, and, being troubled in mind, hasted away. The unconnected verbs remind the commentators of Caesar's famous despatch, \"Vent, vidi, vici.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail. This description is wholly inapplicable to the destruction of Sennacherib's host, unperceived until it was accomplished (2 Kings 19:35), but is sufficiently in agreement with the narrative of 2 Chronicles 20:1-23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. The literal exposition is wholly out of place, since history does not speak of any co-operation of a fleet with a land army in any attack upon Pales. fine. The expression must be used metaphorically of a great and violent destruction wrought by the arm of God upon Israel's foes. Still, the imagery would scarcely have been used, unless there had been something in the circumstances of the time to suggest it, as there certainly was in Jehoshaphat's time, whose fleet of \"ships of Tamhish\" was \"broken\" at Ezion-geber (1 Kings 22:48). The poet may have witnessed the catastrophe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.

Jehoshaphat, on his return to Jerusalem from the scene of his adversaries' slaughter, held a thanksgiving service in the temple, \"with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets,\" because the Lord had made the people to rejoice over their enemies (2 Chronicles 20:27, 28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - According to thy Name, O God, so is thy praise. The \"Name of God,\" i.e. the character that he has established for himself by former mighty deeds, and the praise which he has now won by the recent deliverance, are coextensive. Both of them reach unto the ends of the earth; i.e. over all the regions known to the writer. Thy right hand is full of righteousness. Thou hast dealt out a righteous judgment by thy right hand and thy stretched-out arm, thereby showing how full thy right hand is of justice and judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let Mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad; i.e. let there be a chorus of joyful thanks over the length and breadth of the land, not only in Jerusalem, but in every city of Judah (Joshua 15:45) equally. Because of thy judgments. Because thou hast vindicated thy people, and executed judgment on their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWalk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Walk about Zion, and go round about her; tell the towers thereof. Admire, i.e., O Israelites, your glorious city, which God has preserved for you intact. Walk around it, view it on every side; observe its strength and beauty. Nay, count its towers, and see how many they are, that ye may form a true estimate of its defences, which render it well-nigh impregnable. Such a survey would \"tend to the glorifying of the God of Israel, and to the strengthening of their faith\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Mark ye well her bulwarks (or, her ramparts), consider her palaces. Note the height and fine masonry of her outer wall, which no people could destroy except the Romans (Nehemiah 1:3; Nehemiah 2:13-17; Nehemiah 4:6). And note also the grand houses of her princes and nobles (Amos 6:11), which show themselves even above the ramparts. That ye may tell it to the generation following. That ye may let them know \"how splendid Jerusalem appeared on the morrow of its great danger\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm48:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For this God (i.e. the God who has now delivered us) is our God for ever and ever; i.e. he will always remain faithful to us, as we will to him. He will be our Guide even unto death. Dr. Kay translates \"even over death,\" and understands that God's loving protection is promised to the faithful even in the land beyond the grave. But he stands alone in this interpretation. Host moderns question whether the words על־מוּת are any part of the psalm, and, comparing them with the על־מוּת לבּן of the title to Psalm 9, suggest that they are a mere musical notation. But the psalm would end abruptly without the words, and the meaning, \"he will be our Guide unto death,\" is quite satisfactory (so Hengstenberg and the Revised Version).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.49":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth low and high, rich and poor, together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Both high and low, rich and poor, together.

The psalmist is \"like a minstrel who has to play a piece of music put into his hands. The strain is none of his own devising; and as he proceeds, each note awakes in him a mysterious echo, which he would fain catch and retain in memory\" (Kay). A \"parable\" in the Old Testament means any enigmatical or dark saying, into which much metaphor or imagery is introduced, so that it is only φωνᾶν συνετοῖσι. I will open my dark saying upon the harp; i.e. with a harp accompaniment. Music was a help to inspired persons in the delivery of messages which they were commissioned to deliver (see 1 Samuel 10:5; 2 Kings 3:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-15. - The prelude, or introduction, being over, the substance of the \"dark saying\" is now brought forth. The problem is propounded. On the one hand are the righteous, fallen upon evil days, surrounded by treacherous foes, ever on the watch to do them a mischief (ver. 5); on the other are the wicked, \"trusting in their wealth, and boasting themselves in the multitude of their riches\" (ver. 6), so opulent that they build houses which they expect to \"continue for ever\" and proprietors on such a scale that their lands are \"called after their names\" (ver. 11); and both parties equally short-lived, soon swept away from earth (vers. 10, 12). How is it that God allows all this, and how is man to reconcile himself to it? Simply by two reflections - one, that for the wicked, who have their portion in this life, there is no hope of happiness after death (vers. 14, 17); and the other that \"God will redeem the righteous from the power of the grave, and will receive them\" (ver. 15). Verse 5. - Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil? i.e. have I reason to fear, or may I trust in God's protection? Are, or are not, the righteous under his care? When the iniquity of my heels; rather, of my supplanters - of those that would trip me up. Shall compass me about; i.e. surround me, lie in wait for me on every side (comp. Psalm 17:10-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They that trust in their wealth; rather, even of them that trust in their wealth. The sense runs on from the preceding verse (so Hengstenberg and Professor Cheyne). And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches. Such men are always persecutors of the righteous. They are worldly, carnal, godless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - None of them can by any means redeem his brother. The text is suspected. If we read אַך for אָה, with Ewald and Professor Cheyne, the right translation will be, Nevertheless, no man can by any means redeem himself. With all his boasting, the rich man cannot effect his own redemption; nor, however great his wealth, can he give to God a ransom for him; i.e. for himself. \"Brother\" is not used in the Psalms in the sense of \"fellow-man,\" but only in the literal sense of close blood, relation (Psalm 35:14; Psalm 50:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For the redemption of their soul is precious; or, costly - too costly, i.e., for them, however rich they may be, to be able to effect it (comp. Job 36:18, 19). And it ceaseth for ever; rather, and one must let that aloes for ever (Cheyne, Kay, Hengstenberg, Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption. This verse is to be closely connected with ver. 7, ver. 8 being parenthetical It describes the effect which the payment of a ransom by the rich, were it possible, might be expected to have.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish. The rich man must see that any hope of ransoming himself by means of his wealth, and so escaping death and the grave, is vain, since the law of mortality, which is in operation all around him, is universal. No one is redeemed from death, in the sense of escaping \"the first death.\" Not only do \"the fool and the brutish person\" perish, but the fate of \"the wise\" is the same. All die; all quit the earth; all leave behind them everything that they possessed on earth; no one can take with him the gold in which he has trusted (ver. 6); all leave their wealth to others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all generations. Still, though they know this, the rich and worldly have an idea - an \"inward thought\" - which they cherish, that they can m a certain sense escape death by founding families and leaving to their children substantial houses, which will keep up the family reputation, and accumulating landed estates, to which they may affix their name, so keeping their memories alive to future ages. They call their lands after their own names (see Genesis 10:2, 4, 6, 22, 23, 29, etc.; and compare the Greek traditions with respect to Hellen, Ion, Achaeus, Pelops, Cadmus, etc.). To call cities after their own names, or the names of their sons, was a still commoner practice of great men in the olden times (Genesis 4:17; Genesis 11:31; Exodus 1:11; 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 14; vol. 3. pp. 45, 92, 112; vol. 7. pp. 32, 39, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not. Against these\" inward thoughts\" and outward actions, the psalmist simply maintains the ground already taken (ver. 10): \"Man, in whatever honour he may be, abideth not\" - has but a short time to live. He is like the beasts that perish. He has no more continuance than many of the beasts; like them, he passes from earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This their way is their folly; or, their vain conceit (Kay). By \"their way\" must be understood the course of conduct described in vers. 7-12. Yet their posterity approve their sayings. Their descendants, or those who come after them, notwithstanding the foolishness of their course, adopt their principles and delight in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLike sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them. With the foolish fancies and vain conceits of the ungodly rich men, the psalmist now contrasts the reality. When they die they are \"laid in the grave,\" or \"ranged in Hades\" (Kay), as sheep in a sheepfold. There is no escape for them. Death is their shepherd; he keeps them, watches over them, tends them, allows none to quit the fold. And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning. When the resurrection morn comes - and no other explanation appears to be possible (see even Cheyne) - it will bring them no release; the righteous will then \"have domination over them,\" and will certainly not set them free (Revelation 21:8). And their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling; rather, and their beauty is for Hades to consume out of its dwelling; i.e. its clay tenement (so Dr. Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave. Here is the solution of the \"dark saying,\" the key to the\" parable.\" The souls of the righteous will be redeemed, not by themselves, but by God - they will be delivered \"from the power of the grave,\" or rather of Hades; and, while the ungodly are held under by death and the grave (ver. 14), they will be released, and enter upon a higher life. For he shall receive me. As God \"took Enoch,\" when he \"was not\" (Genesis 4:24) - took him to be with himself - so he will \"receive\" every righteous soul, and take it home, and give it rest and peace in his own dwelling-place. As Professor Cheyne observes, \"It is the weakest of explanations to say that the psalmist rejoices thus in the prospect of mere deliverance from the danger of death. A few years later, and the prospect will return in a heightened form.\" The fact is that \"the poet has that religious intuition which forms the kernel of the hope of immortality.\" At the same time, we may admit, as Hupfeld argues, that the belief in immortality is \"not here stated as a revealed doctrine, but as a presentiment, a deep inward conviction, inseparable from real living faith in a living God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-20. - The conclusion \"repeats and confirms the general lessons of the psalm.\" Ver. 16 is a categorical answer to the doubt propounded in ver. 5. Vers. 17-19 are an echo of ver. 14, and at the same time a counterpoise to the views put forth in vers. 6, 11. Ver. 20 is a repetition, but with an important modification, of ver. 12. Verse 16. - Be not thou afraid when one is made rich (see vers. 5, 6). There is no ground for fear, nor even for perplexity, when the wicked grow rich and prosper. Their wealth will not ransom their souls (vers. 7-9). They cannot take it with them to another world (ver. 17). They will have no advantage from it there. On the contrary, their misery in another world will be such as to far outweigh any enjoyment which they may have had on earth (vers. 14, 19). When the glory of his house is increased (see ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away. Nothing in the way of earthly possessions - nothing but the qualities which he has imprinted on his soul, and made part and parcel of himself. The heathen nations, foolishly, were accustomed to bury clothes, and arms, and vessels, and stores of gold with the departed, as though they could take these with them into the other world (see the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. pp. 59-62, end notes 9, 1, 2). The writer of the psalm, and those whom he addressed, were equally aware of the foolishness of such customs. His glory shall not descend after him. Whatever \"glory\" his wealth has secured to him in this life shall be left behind. He shall be imprisoned in Sheol, with death to shepherd him (ver. 14), and with no hope of returning to the \"light\" (ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Though while he lived he blessed his soul (comp. Psalm 10:3; Luke 12:19). He thought himself happy, and congratulated himself on his good fortune. And men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. A parenthetic remark. Not only do such men congratulate themselves, but the world's applause follows on them. So long as they are well-to-do, and keep themselves in the forefront of the battle of life, they will have \"honour, reverence, and troops of friends,\" who will admire them and flatter them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He shall go to the generation of his fathers. In the Hebrew it is \"thou shalt go,\" or \"it (the soul) shall go;\" but the meaning is well expressed by the Authorized Version. However much the wicked man delights in his life, and clings to it, nevertheless he has to die (ver. 10), to join the \"generations of his fathers,\" to go where they have gone before him. And, once in Sheol (ver. 14), they shall never see light. God will redeem the soul of the righteous from the power of Sheol (ver. 15); but the rich ungodly man, and those to whom he goes - men of his sort - shall for evermore not see light.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm49:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMan that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Man that is in honour, and under. standeth not, is like the beasts that perish. In ver. 12 the writer had said of all men, that they are \"like the beasts that perish,\" which is true in one sense; i.e. in reference to this life. Now, having taken a loftier flight, and embraced in his mental vision the whole life of man, he makes an important qualification of what he had said. All men die; but only those who are \"without understanding\" die without hope - \"like the beasts:\" for others there remains the hope enunciated in ver. 15.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness. Not \"the God who imputes to me righteousness,\" as some render, but \"the God who sees that I and my cause are righteous,\" and who wilt therefore certainly lend me aid. Thou hast enlarged me; or, made room for me - \"set me at ease\" In the language of the Old Testament, \"straits\" and \"narrowness\" mean trouble and affliction; \"room,\" \"space,\" \"enlargement,\" mean prosperity. David has experienced God's mercies in the past, and therefore looks for them in the future (comp. Psalm 3:7). When I woe in distress; literally, in [my] distress. Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. This is David's usual cry, repeated in a hundred varied forms throughout the Psalms (see Psalm 5:2; Psalm 6:2; Psalm 9:13; Psalm 27:7; Psalm 30:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - O ye sons of men. \"Sons of men \" - beney ish - is not a mere periphrasis for \"men.\" It is a title of some honour and dignity. Kay translates, \"sons of the brave;\" but that is scarcely the meaning. The phrase is rather equivalent to our \"sirs\" ('Speaker's Commentary.'). How long will ye turn my glory into shame? By your misconduct. See the clause which follows. The appeal is, perhaps, to Joab, Abishai, and others of David s own party, whoso proceedings were a disgrace to his reign, and tended to bring their master to shame rather than to honour. How long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? i.e. after lying. Joab's treachery and falsehood were notorious (2 Samuel 3:27; 2 Samuel 20:8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself. The best order of the words would be, \"Know that the Lord hath set apart for himself the man that is godly.\" The godly man is not contaminated by the evil doings of those who associate with him, and profess to act in his interest, if he neither authorizes nor condones their conduct. David had protested against Joab's proceedings on one occasion (2 Samuel 3:28), and never at any time pardoned them (1 Kings 2:5, 6). The Lord will hear when I call unto him Although I am disgraced (Ver. 2), resisted, in many ways brought to shame, by you, yet still I am God's servant, set apart to his service, and therefore 1 shall be heard by him. He will hearken to and grant my prayer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTStand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Stand in awe, and sin not. The LXX. render, Ὀργίζεσθε καὶ μὴ ἀμαρτάνετε, \"Be ye angry, and sin not;\" and this meaning is preferred by Dr. Kay, Hengstenberg, and ethers. It may also seem to have the sanction of St. Paul in Ephesians 4:26. If we adopt it, we must suppose the exhortation to be addressed mainly to David's own followers, who are warned against excessive anger and its natural result, undue violence (comp. 2 Samuel 16:9; 2 Samuel 18:11, 14; 2 Samuel 19:21, etc.). Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still (compare St. Paul's injunction, \"Let not the sun go down upon your wrath\"). Anger cools if a little time be suffered to pass - if a night be allowed for reflection, and no action be taken till the morrow, Παύει γὰρ ὀργὴγ ὁ χρόνος (Aristotle). Selah. The second strophe being ended, another \"pause\" is to take place, during which the psalmist's exhortation may be made the subject of consideration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOffer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Sacrifices of victims are scarcely meant; certainly not, if the time of the composition is that of David's exile, since victims could be offered nowhere but at Jerusalem. We may suppose a reference to those sacrifices which are most truly \"sacrifices of righteousness,\" vie. \"a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart,\" which God \"will not despise\" (Psalm 51:17). And put your trust in the Lord. Sacrifice without faith is vain. Even \"sacrifices of righteousness,\" to be of any service, must be accompanied by trust in the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - There be many that say, Who will show us any good? Pessimists are numerous in all ages. Among David's adherents in his times of distress (ver. 1) would be many who doubted and desponded, anticipating nothing but continued suffering and misfortune. Theft would ask the question of the text. Or the scope may be wider. Men are always seeking for good, but not knowing what their true good is. David points it out to them. It is to have the light of God's countenance shining on them. Lord, lift thou up, etc.; compare the form of Levitical benediction (Numbers 6:24-26), and see also Psalm 31:15; Psalm 80:3, 7, 19. If we bask in the sunshine of God's favour, there is nothing more needed for happiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou hast put gladness in my heart. David is an example to the de-spending ones. Notwithstanding his sufferings and calamities, God has looked on him, and so \"put gladness in his heart\" - a gladness which far exceeds that of his adversaries. Though they are in prosperity, and have their corn and wine increased, and enjoy all the \"outward material blessings promised to Israel - the wheat and the grape - for a supply of which he is indebted to the generosity of friends\" (Kay), yet he would not change places with them. The spiritual joy which fills his own heart is preferable to any amount of material comforts and pleasures.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep (comp. Psalm 3:5). His confidence in God enables David to lay himself down calmly and tranquilly to sleep, whatever dangers threaten him. He seeks his couch, and at once (יחדּו) slumber visits him. No anxious thoughts keep him tossing on his bed for hours. For thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety. David has a satisfaction in thinking that it is God only who watches over him. All other help would be vain, superfluous. God alone brought Israel through the wilderness (Deuteronomy 32:12); God alone established Israel in Canaan (Psalm 44:2, 3). David feels that he needs no second helper and protector.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.50":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken. A combination of three names of God - viz. El, Elohim, and Jehovah - only found here and in Joshua 22:22. There it is translated \"the Lord God of gods,\" which is a possible rendering. Separately, the three names seem to mean, \"The Mighty One,\" \"The Many in One\" (Cheyne) or \"The Three in One,\" and '\"The Self-Existent One.\" He who is all these, the psalmist announces, \"has spoken,\" and called (or, summoned) the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof; i.e. God has summoned all mankind to hear his judgment of his covenant people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty (comp. Psalm 48:2; Lamentations 2:15; 1 Macc. 2:12). God hath shined; i.e. has shown himself in his dazzling radiance. The psalmist, however, does not mean to announce a material, but a spiritual, fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence; rather, and let him not keep silence. Let him call attention to his \"coming,\" that his judgment may be widely known. A fire (rather, fire) shall devour before him (comp. Psalm 21:9). And it shall be very tempestuous round about him. So in all theophanies (see Exodus 19:16; 1 Kings 19:11; Job 38:1; Psalm 18:13; Psalm 97:2-5; Acts 2:2; Revelation 4:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He shall call to the heavens from above; rather, to the heavens above; i.e. to the inhabitants of heaven - the holy angels.

Heaven and earth are called upon to come together, and furnish a fit audience before which the judgment may proceed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Gather my saints together unto me. By \"my saints\" the psalmist means here, not godly Israel, as in Psalm 16:3, but all Israel - the whole nation, whether true servants of Jehovah, or only professed servants. This is rendered clear by the ensuing clause, Those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. Not even was the first covenant dedicated without blood (Hebrews 9:18; comp. Exodus 24:3-8); nor could any Israelite remain within the covenant without frequent sacrifice (Exodus 12:2-47, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.

The judgment seems to be adjourned, or to be left to the conscience of the defendants.\" The faithful are summoned, and appear, but not to receive unqualified commendation (see Matthew 25:31-40). Rather they receive a warning. The strong and prolonged depreciation of sacrifice (vers. 8-13) necessarily implies that in the religion of the time too much stress was laid upon it. We know that, in the heathen world, men sought to buy God's favour by their sacrifices, some] believing that, physically, the gods were nourished by the steam of the victims, others regarding them as laid under obligations which they could not disregard (Plato, 'Rep.,' it. § 6; Rawlinson, 'Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 124, 125). We know, too, that, in the later monarchy, sacrifice to so great an extent superseded true spiritual worship among the Israelites themselves, that it became an offence to God, and was spoken of in terms of reprobation (Isaiah 1:11-13; Isaiah 66:3). Already, it would seem, this tendency was manifesting itself, and a warning from Heaven was needed against it. Verse 7. - Hear, O my people, and I will speak. God will not speak to deaf ears. Unless men are ready to attend to him, he keeps silence. O Israel, and I will testify against thee; or, protest unto thee (Kay, Cheyne). I am God, even thy God.

It is for no neglect of the outward ritual of religion - of sacrifice and offering - that I have to reprove thee. To have been continually before me; rather, they have been continually before me. I have had enough of them, and to spare. Not only have the daily morning and evening sacrifices been regularly offered, and the national worship thus kept up without a break; but the private offerings of individuals (see vers. 9, 13) have been continuous and ample in number. But they have not been acceptable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.

So the Revised Version, Dr. Kay, Canon Cook, the Four Friends, and others; but many critics regard such a rendering as impossible. Of these, some translate, \"And the cattle upon the hills, where there are thousands\" (Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, etc.); while others read אלהים for אלפ, and render, \"And the cattle upon the mountains of God\" (Olshausen, Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I know all the fowls of the mountains, and the wild beasts of the field are mine; literally, are 'with me.

But is it to be supposed, can any suppose it possible, that I, the Lord of heaven and earth, the invisible Author of all things, both visible and invisible, can need material sustenance, and can condescend to find any sustenance in bulls' flesh and goats' blood? Scarcely did even the grossest of the heathen take this view. A vapour, an odour (κνίσση), was thought to ascend from the victims sacrificed, and this penetrated to the Olympian abodes, and gratified, or, as some would say, \"fed\" the gods. But such coarse feeding as that suggested in the text was hardly imagined by any, unless it were by utter savages and barbarians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOffer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Offer unto God thanksgiving.

The meaning is, \"Then, when thou shalt offer unto me a true worship (ver. 14), if thou wilt call upon me in the day of trouble, I will assuredly deliver thee, and so give thee occasion for glorifying me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-21. - While even the more godly among the Israelites have been thus, to a certain extent, reproved (vers. 8-14), the psalmist now addresses to the ungodly, the open and wilful transgressors, a far sterner rebuke. They claim the privileges of God's covenanted servants (ver. 16), but perform none of the duties (vers. 17-20), thus bringing down upon themselves a terrible menace. Verse 16. - But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? The wicked assumed that they were true Israelites. They were familiar with the words of God's statutes, and with the terms of the covenant. They claimed the right of enforcing them against others (Romans 2:18-20), while in their own persons they set them at nought (vers. 18-20). God declares that they have no right to assume to be teachers of others until they have taught themselves - they are unfit even to \"take his covenant in their mouth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Seeing thou hatest instruction (comp. Proverbs 1:25, 29). God, by his Law, teaches men their duties; but many men \"hate\" to be instructed. And castest my words behind thee (comp. 1 Kings 14:9; Nehemiah 9:26). They proceed from \"inward alienation\" to \"open rejection\" of the moral law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst unto him. God tests his professed, but really disobedient, servants by the second table of the Decalogue, and finds them wanting. If they do not themselves actually rob, they give their consent, they become accessories before the fact, to robbery. They probably participate in the gains. And hast been partaker with adulterers; rather, and with adulterers is thy portion; i.e. thou hast thrown in thy lot with them, hast adopted their principles, hast set at nought the seventh no less than the eighth commandment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit; rather, thou hast loosed thy mouth to evil; i.e. given it liberty to utter all manner of wicked speech; and especially thou hast used mouth and tongue to cozen and deceive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother. Professor Cheyne understands by \"brother\" any fellow-Israelite; but the parallel in the second hemistich - Thou slanderest thine own mother's son - implies that an actual brother is intended. It is one of the special characteristics of the reprobate to be \"without natural affection\" (Romans 1:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself. Because God did not interpose openly to punish the sins committed, the transgressor dared to imagine him to be indifferent to sin, \"such an one as himself\" - no holier, no purer, no more averse to evil. But I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. But now the time is come when I shall no longer keep silence; I shall openly \"reprove\" thee, and marshal in set order before thee all the wicked deeds which thou hast done. God, as Calvin says, \"will lay before them in exact order a full catalogue of their misdeeds, which they must read and own, whether they will or not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Now consider this, ye that forget God. Having been \"reproved,\" the wicked are now, in conclusion, exhorted and warned. \"Consider this;\" i.e. take it to heart, reflect upon it, let it sink deeply into your minds and consciences, and act upon it. Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. A most awful threat. To \"tear in pieces\" is the act of a wild beast (Psalm 7:2). Job declares that God \"teareth him;\" but otherwise the expression is scarcely used of Divine chastisements. Certainly, if God, in his anger, lays hold upon a man to punish him, there is no possible deliverance at the hand of any other man (Psalm 49:7, 8). Deliverance, if it comes at all, must come from the Redeemer within the Godhead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm50:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Whose offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God. As the wicked have their parting warning, so the godly have their parting encouragement. God is \"glorified\" (see ver. 15) by those who offer him praise from a sincere heart; and if a man will lay down for himself a straight path and pursue it, God will \"show him his salvation;' i.e. will bring him to peace and blessedness.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.51":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness. It is observable that the whole psalm is addressed to God (Elohim), and not to Jehovah (the \"Lord\" in ver. 15 is Adonai), as though the psalmist felt himself unworthy to utter the covenant-name, and simply prostrated himself as a guilty man before his offended Maker. It is not correet to say that \"loving-kindness implies a covenant\" (Cheyne), since God is \"good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works\" (Psalm 145:9). According unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. David's first prayer is for pity; his second, to have his offences \"blotted out,\" or \"wiped out\" - entirely removed from God's book (comp. Exodus 32:32; Isaiah 43:25; Isaiah 44:22). He says \"my transgressions,\" in the plural, because \"his great sin did not stand alone - adultery was followed by treachery and murder\" (Canon Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Wash me throughly from mine iniquity. Wash me, as a fuller washes a fouled garment (πλῦνον, LXX., not υίψον), not as a man washes his skin. And cleanse me from my sin. \"Transgressions,\" \"iniquity,\" \"sin,\" cover every form of moral evil, and, united together, imply the deepest guilt (comp. vers. 3, 5, 9, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For I acknowledge my transgressions (comp. Psalm 32:5, \"I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin\"). The first step in repentance is contrition; the second, confession; the third, amendment of life. And my sin is ever before me. I bear it in mind; I do not hide it from myself. I keep it continually before my mental vision. This, too, is characteristic of true penitence. Mock penitents confess their sins, and straightway forget them. Real genuine ones find it impossible to forget.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgainst thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Against thee, thee only, have I sinned. Though no sins could be more directly against man than adultery and murder, yet David feels that that aspect of them shrinks away into insignificance, and is as if it were not, when they are viewed in their true and real character, as offences against the majesty of God. Every sin is mainly against God; and the better sort of men always feel this. \"How can I do this great wickedness,\" says Joseph, when tempted by Potiphar's wife, \"and sin against God?\" And so David to Nathan, when he was first rebuked by him, \"I have sinned against the Lord\" (2 Samuel 12:13). And done this evil in thy sight; that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. Clear in the eyes of the world, that is; free from all charge of harshness or injustice, when thou judgest me, and condemnest me for my sins, as thou must do.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-12. - The prayer now makes a stride in advance. It has been hitherto for the first step in justification - the wiping out of past transgressions. It is now for restoration, for a renewal of spiritual life, for a return to God's favour, and to the spiritual joy involved in it. First, however, an additional confession is made (vers. 5, 6). Not only have I committed acts of sin (vers. 1-4), but sin is thoroughly ingrained into my nature. I was conceived in it; I was brought forth in it; only the strongest remedies can cleanse me from it (ver. 7). But cleansing alone is not enough. I need renewal (ver. 10); I need thy Holy Spirit (ver. 11); I crave, above all, the sense of a restoration to thy favour - a return to the old feelings of \"joy and gladness\" (ver. 8), even \"the joy of thy salvation\" (ver. 12). Verse 5. - Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; rather, in iniquity was I brought forth. And in sin did my mother conceive me. It is doubtless true, as Professor Cheyne says, that \"the Old Testament contains no theory of the origin of sin\" - no formulated doctrine on the subject. But the fact of congenital depravity is stated, not only here, but also in Job 14:4; Psalm 58:3; it is also implied in Isaiah 43:27 and Hosea 6:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts (comp. Job 38:36). God requires not merely such purity as might be attained by the use of legal and ritual methods; but true inward purity of thought and heart, which is a very different matter. And in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom; rather, do thou make me. An optative, according to Professor Cheyne. The meaning is, \"As nothing will content thee but this perfect, inward purity, do thou give me into my heart its fundamental principle-wisdom, or the fear of God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean. \"Hyssop\" alone could by the Levitical Law cleanse from contact with a corpse (Numbers 19:18) or from the defilement of leprosy (Leviticus 14:4). David recognizes that his impurity is of the extremest kind, and needs the remedy which has the greatest purifying power. Legally, this was the hyssop, with its \"blood of sprinkling\" (Leviticus 14:6, 7); spiritually, it was the blood of Christ, which was thus symbolized. Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Again the word is used which corresponds to the Greek πλῦνον. \"Wash me as garments are washed by the fuller\" (see the comment on ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Make me to hear joy and gladness (comp. below, ver. 12). On forgiveness follows naturally the sense of it, and this sense is in itself a deep satisfaction. But the psalmist seems to ask for something more. He wants not mere negative peace and rest, but the active thrilling joy which those experience who feel themselves restored to God's favour, and bask in the light of his countenance. That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. That every ache and pain may cease, and be replaced by gladness and rejoicing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hide thy face from my sins. Turn thyself away from them - do not so much as see them. The apostle speaks of times of ignorance, which God \"winked at\" (Acts 17:30). And blot out all mine iniquities (comp. ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCreate in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Create in me a clean heart, O God; i.e. do more than purify me - do more than cleanse me (ver. 7); by an act of creative power (בּרא) make in me a new clean heart. Compare the Christian doctrine of the \"new birth\" and \"new life.\" And renew a right spirit within me. \"Heart\" and \"spirit\" are used interchangeably for the inward essence of man; but, as Professor Cheyne observes, \"Heart emphasizes the individual side of a man's life; spirit, its Divine, or at least preternatural side.\" David, in asking both for a new heart and a new spirit, requests the renovation of his entire mental and moral nature, which he recognizes as corrupt and depraved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Cast me not away from thy presence. To he \"cast away from God's presence\" is to be altogether cast out of his covenant, made an alien from him, deprived of his favour and the light of his countenance (see Genesis 4:14; 2 Kings 13:23). The psalmist deprecates so terrible a punishment, although he feels that he has deserved it. And take not thy Holy Spirit from me. God's Holy Spirit had been poured upon David when he was first anointed by Samuel to the kingly office (1 Samuel 16:13). His great sins had undoubtedly \"grieved\" and vexed the Spirit; and, had they been continued or not repented of, would have caused him to withdraw himself; but they had not \"wholly quenched the Spirit\" (1 Thessalonians 5:19). David was therefore able to pray, as he does, that the Holy Spirit of God might still be vouchsafed to him, and not be \"taken away,\" as from one wholly unworthy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRestore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation. Give me back that \"joy\" which was mine when I was conscious of thy favour, and felt that thou wert my Strength and my Salvation (Psalm 18:1; Psalm 62:2, etc.). And uphold me with thy free spirit. There is no \"thy\" in the original; and it is his own spirit, not God's Spirit, of which the psalmist here speaks. \"Uphold me,\" he says, \"preserve me from falling, by giving me a 'free,' or 'generous,' or 'noble' spirit - the opposite of that 'spirit of bondage' which the apostle says that Christians do not receive\" (Romans 8:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-17. - The psalmist now turns from prayer to promise. If God will grant his petitions, restore him to favour, and renew his spiritual life, then he will make such return as is possible to him. First, he will teach transgressors God's ways (ver. 13). Next, he will extol his righteousness, and show forth his praise(vers. 14, 15). Finally, he will offer him, not bloody sacrifice, but the sacrifice in which he delights - \"the sacrifice of a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart\" (vers. 16, 17). Such sacrifice, he is sure, God will not despise. Verse 13. - Then will I teach transgressors thy ways. The truly grateful heart cannot be satisfied without making some return to God for his goodness. The most satisfactory return is by deeds, not words. David's determination is to do his best to promote the glory of God by bringing others to salvation, turning them from their own evil ways to the \"ways\" that God would have them walk in. And sinners shall be converted unto thee. The result, he hopes, will be the conversion to God of many \"sinners\" (comp. Psalm 32:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God. In David's mouth this prayer is readily intelligible. In that of Babylonian exiles, the victims of oppression and wrong, it would be most extraordinary. Thou God of my salvation (comp. Psalm 18:46; Psalm 25:5; Psalm 27:9: 88:1, etc.). And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. In further acknowledgment of God's goodness, and as, in some sort, a return for it, David will employ himself in singing the praises of God (see his many psalms of praise) and will especially exalt God's righteousness. \"Jehovah,\" as Professor Cheyne observes, \"is equally righteous when he sends and when he removes chastisements.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - O Lord (not Jehovah, but Adonai), open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. A sense of his guilt has long kept the psalmist's lips closed. Let his sins be forgiven, and his conscience relieved, then praise and thanksgiving will flow from his mouth freely and copiously.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it. If there had been any sacrifices which God desired or required for such offences as adultery and murder, David would have willingly offered them. But there were none. As Hammond observes, \"The Mosaical Law allows no reconciliation, no sacrifice, for such sins.\" Thou delightest not in burnt offering. In the mere act of sacrifice - the untimely slaying of his own creatures - God could at no time have had any pleasure. His satisfaction could only arise from the spirit in which sacrifices were offered - the gratitude, devotion, self-renunciation, obedience, of those who approached him with them (comp. Psalm 40:6; Psalm 50:8-13; Isaiah 1:11-17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The sacrifices of God; i.e. the sacrifices which God really values and desires. Are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. \"The contrite heart,\" says Hengstenberg, \"denotes deep but soft and mild distress.\" It sets up no wild shriekings, no howls, like those of Oriental fanatics. But it nourishes a sorrow that is deep and persistent. The joy on account of forgiveness and restoration to favour does not exclude continued pain on account of past sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - That this is an addition made to the original psalm, during the time of the Babylonian exile, or later, for liturgical purposes, has been maintained by a large number of the commentators who ascribe the rest of the psalm to David. The chief ground for the supposition is the prayer in ver. 18, \"Build thou the walls of Jerusalem,\" which has been supposed to imply that the walls were in ruins, whereas under David they should have been, it is thought, in good condition. But it has been pointed out, very justly, that the fortifications of Jerusalem were not complete in David's time, and that both he and Solomon added considerably to them (2 Samuel 5:9; 1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings 9:15, 19). David may well have thought that, as a punishment for his sin, God might interfere with the work which he was doing for the benefit of his people, and hence have felt it needful to pray, \"Do good unto Zion: build thou the wails of Jerusalem.\" Verse 18. - Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion. It is characteristic of David to pass from prayer for himself to prayer for the people committed to him, and especially to do so at or near the end of a psalm (see Psalm 5:11, 12; Psalm 25:22; Psalm 28:9; Psalm 40:16). And he closely connects - nay, identifies - the people with their capital city (see Psalm 46:4; Psalm 48:11: 69:35, etc.). Build thou the walls of Jerusalem. Josephus says that David encompassed the whole city of Jerusalem with walls ('Ant. Jud.,' 7:3, § 2); and we are told, in the Second Book of Samuel, that he \"built round about from Mille and inward.\" It has been argued that his walls were just approaching their completion at the time of his great sin (Christian Observer, No. 333).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm51:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness. \"Then\" - when the walls are completed - thou shalt receive the public sacrifices which will naturally be offered on the accomplishment of such a work (Nehemiah 12:43). And these sacrifices, offered willingly by grateful hearts, will be pleasing and acceptable unto thee. With burnt offering, and whole burnt offering. Only the head, the fat, and certain portions of the interior were ordinarily burnt when a victim was offered (Leviticus 1:8, 12; Leviticus 3:3, 4, etc.); but sometimes, when the offerer's heart was full, and he desired to indicate its complete and undivided surrender to God, the entire victim was consumed (see Hengstenberg, ad loc.). Then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar. Bullocks, or oxen, were offered on all great occasions (see 2 Samuel 24:22-25; 1 Kings 8:63; 1 Chronicles 29:21; 2 Chronicles 7:5; 2 Chronicles 29:32, 33; 2 Chronicles 35:7, 9; Ezra 6:17, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.52":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? Doeg was \"the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul\" (1 Samuel 21:7), or, according to another passage (1 Samuel 22:9), \"set over the servants of Saul.\" The position would be a high one, and would imply the possession of much physical strength. A sense of tyranny or extreme arrogance seems to attach to the word translated \"mighty one\" (gibber); see Genesis 6:4; Genesis 10:8. The word translated \"mischief\" implies something worse. In Psalm 6:9 it is rendered \"wickedness,\" and is thought to mean, in the Psalms generally, \"ruinous, unfathomable evil - destructive malignity\" (Canon Cook). The goodness of God endureth continually. Why not follow the Divine pattern, instead of setting thyself in direct antagonism to it? Canst thou expect to prosper when thou art thus opposed to the Almighty?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp rasor, working deceitfully.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; or, malignities - evils of the worst kind. It was Doeg's \"tongue\" that brought about the entire ghastly massacre (see 1 Samuel 22:9, 10). Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. Doeg had \"worked deceitfully,\" since he had not told Saul the circumstances that made Ahimelech's giving aid to David no disloyalty to the king (1 Samuel 21:2, 8). The suppressio veri is a suggestio falsi.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness.

It is to say, with Milton's Satan, \"Evil, be thou my good!\" And lying rather than to speak righteousness (see the comment on ver. 2). Doeg's crimes seem to have arisen out of a mere love of evil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou lovest all devouring words. \"Devouring words\" are words that cause ruin and destruction.

As thy \"devouring words\" have been the destruction of many, so shall God, in return, \"destroy thee\" (literally, pull thee down) \"for ever\" - destroy thee, i.e., with a complete and final destruction. He shall take thee away; rather, seize thee (Kay, Cheyne), and pluck thee out of thy dwelling-place; literally, out of thy tent (comp. Job 18:14; 1 Kings 12:16). And root thee out of the land of the living. Destroy thee, root and branch, as thou didst destroy the entire house of Ahimelech (1 Samuel 22:17-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The righteous also shall see, and fear. Every manifestation of the Divine power and justice produces in the righteous man a feeling of awe. And shall laugh at him; literally, over him. This awe does not, however, prevent him from indulging in something like derision of his fallen enemy - or, at least, it did not under the old covenant, when men had not yet been taught that they ought to \"love\" their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength. The root of Doeg's wickedness was want of trust in God, and consequent alienation from him. But trusted in the abundance of his riches. This led on to an excessive trust in riches, and greediness of gain. To obtain wealth he became Saul's unscrupulous tool, the willing instrument of his cruelty. No doubt Saul richly rewarded him. And strengthened himself in his wickedness; or, in his substance (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. In conclusion, the psalmist contrasts his own condition, as one of God's people, with that of Doeg, which he had described in vers. 7-9. Doeg is about to be \"plucked up\" and \"rooted out of the land of the living\" (ver. 5); he is like a flourishing green olive tree planted in the sanctuary, or \"house of God.\" Doeg is entirely without any trust in the Almighty (ver. 7); he declares of himself, I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. It is questioned whether olive trees were at any time planted in the courts of either the tabernacle or the temple; but it certainly cannot be proved that they were not. In the courts of Egyptian temples trees were abundant (Herod., 2:138; Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 236), also probably in Phoenician temples (Perrot and Chipiez, ' Histoire de l'Art dans l'An-tiquite,' vol. 3. p. 322). And to this day there grow in the Hardin area at Jerusalem, on the site of the Jewish temple, a number of magnificent cypresses, olive, and lemon trees.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm52:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it. So Dr. Kay, who explains the passage as meaning, \"because thou hast worked out this deliverance.' The tense is \"the preterite of pro. phetic certainty\" (comp. Psalm 54:7). And I will wait on thy Name; for it is good before thy saints; rather, I will wait on thy Name in the presence of thy saints, because it is good; or perhaps, if we adopt Hupfeld's emendation (אֲחַוֶּה for אֲקַוֶּה), I will precision thy Name before thy saints that it is good (so Cheyne).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.53":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm53:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.

So long a phrase as \"where no fear was\" (לא־היה כּחד) can scarcely have \"fallen out,\" and must have been added intentionally to mark that, on the occasion in connection with which the revision was made, there had been no ground at all for the panic. For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee. This clause takes the place of the following in Psalm 14.: \"For God is in the generation of the righteous\" - a very considerable change, which must certainly have been intentional. On the second occasion whereto the psalm was made applicable, there must have been a very great catastrophe - some vast slaughter of an enemy who had been at open war with Israel. Sennacherib is suggested (Canon Cook). Thou hast put them to shams, because God hath despised them. The clause in Psalm 14. which this replaces runs as follows: \"Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his Refuge.\" Here again, both the phrases used, and the whole tenor of the thought in either case, are different.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm53:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!

David's designation of his foes as \"strangers\" has been made an argument against the trustworthiness of the \"title,\" since the Ziphites were Israelites of the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:55). But he might well call those \"strangers\" who were treating him as an alien. Comp. Psalm 120:5, where \"the psalmist, heavily oppressed by his countrymen, complains that he dwelt in Mesheeh and Kedar\" (Hengstenberg). And oppressors seek after my soul; or, my life. The phrase is exactly that used in 1 Samuel 23:15, when David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a wood, and \"saw that Saul was come out to seek his life.\" They have not set God before them (comp. Psalm 86:14).

There is a pause between vers. 3 and 4, indicated by the pause-mark, \"Selah.\" Then, confident of his prayer having been heard, the psalmist breaks out into a joyous burst of thankfulness and self-gratulation (vers. 4-7). The Lord is with them that uphold my soul; rather, of them (Revised Version); i.e. \"one of them.\" But the intention is not to place God on a par with other helpers.

Confidence has now mounted up to certainty. Regarding the deliverance as accomplished, the psalmist promises a freewill offering (Hengstenberg, Kay, Canon Cook) to God, so soon as he can approach the sanctuary. The phrase used is the ordinary one for sacrifices of thanksgiving (Numbers 15:3). I will praise thy Name, O Lord; for it is good (comp.

He sees the \"troubles\" over, the Ziphites disappointed and punished, himself not only preserved from the immediate danger, but altogether freed from trouble of every kind, and rejoices in the deliverance which he feels has been accorded him. And mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.

But רשׁע - the word used - is\" the wicked man,\" in the simplest and widest sense (see Psalm 1:1, 4, 5, 6; Psalm 7:9; Psalm 9:16, etc.).

The attacks of his enemies (ver. 3) deeply grieve and pain the heart of the psalmist. It is not as if they were foreigners, whose hostility was to be expected. They are his own countrymen; one of them is his own familiar friend (ver. 12). Yet they threaten his life. And the terrors of death are fallen upon ms. When a king is the object of a conspiracy, he well knows, especially in the East, that nothing but his death will satisfy the conspirators. So on David, long before he made up his mind to quit Jerusalem (2 Samuel 15:14), the \"terrors of death\" must have fallen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

The beauty of this passage has sunk deep into the Christian heart. Great composers have set to it some of their most exquisite music. The desire is one which finds an echo in almost every human breast, and the expression of it here has all the beauty of the best Eastern poetry. Jeremiah's words are far tamer, \"Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them!\" For then would I fly away, and be at rest. The desire of \"rest\" is universal. Whatever the delights of action, they can only charm us for a time.

Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness; rather, and lodge in the wilderness. Doves, ring-doves, and others, are abundant in Palestine, and frequent wild and rocky places, far from the haunts of man. Speaking of a rocky gorge near the Lake of Gennesaret, Canon Tristram says, \"But no description can give an adequate idea of the myriads of rock-pigeons. In absolute crowds they dashed to and fro in the ravine, whirling round with a rush and a whirr that could be felt like a gust of wind\" ('Land of Israel,' p. 446).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. As doves fly from storm and tempest to their nests in the rocks, so the psalmist would fain haste away from the passions and perils of the city to some safe refuge in the wilds. What he here anticipates, he afterwards accomplished, when he fled from Absalom over Jordan (2 Samuel 15:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDestroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-15. - With a sudden transition, the writer passes from his own suffering, fears, and longings, to imprecations on his enemies, and a description of their wicked proceedings. In the course of his description he singles out one individual for special remark - one who had been his own guide, companion, and friend - but who had turned against him, and joined the company of his adversaries (vers. 12-14). Verse 9. - Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues. The second clause contains a reference to the confusion of tongues at Babel (Genesis 11:7). \"Introduce confusion into their counsels, and disperse them, as thou didst with the wicked ones who were forced to leave off to build the Tower.\" For I have seen violence and strife in the city. Such quarrels and broils, i.e., as usually precede revolutionary disturbance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDay and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof. \"It is not a siege or blockade that is described; and the persons spoken of are not foreign, but native enemies. These are compared to watchmen on the walls; only, instead of keeping watch against the enemy, they 'watch for iniquity' \"(Cheyne). Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it; rather, iniquity also and trouble. Compare the \"violence and strife\" of ver. 9. Society is disorganized. It is not only that wickedness prevails, but throughout the city there is violence and contention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets; literally, out of her street (rehob) - \"the open square, where justice ought to have been administered \"(Kay), \"adjoining the vaulted passage of the city gate\" (Cheyne); comp. Job 29:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it. The psalmist passes from the general to the particular - from the great mass of his opponents to one special individual. Even Professor Cheyne allows this, and suggests that we have here Jeremiah inveighing against Pashur. But the general sentiment of commentators has always been that Ahithophel is intended. And, if we allow the psalm to be David's, we can scarcely give any other explanation. Ahithophel was known as \"David's counsellor\" (2 Samuel 15:12), i.e. his chief adviser, his \"grand vizier,\" his \"prime minister? What he counselled was considered as a sort of \"oracle of God\" (2 Samuel 16:23). His defection was the bitterest drop in the cup of the unhappy king. Anything else he \"could have borne;\" but this was too much. Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me. It was not one among my professed and open enemies - not one of those whose hatred I had long known and reckoned on. Then I would have hid myself from him. Instead of opening all my heart to him, as I have done to Ahithophel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But it was thou, a man mine equal; literally, a man according to my valuing; i.e. one of my social rank, with whom I was on familiar terms. My guide; or, \"my companion.\" But the LXX. have ἡγέμων. And mine acquaintance. \"My confidant\" (Kay); \"my familiar friend\" (Cheyne, and Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - We took sweet counsel together (comp. 2 Samuel 15:12; 2 Samuel 16:23; 1 Chronicles 27:33). And walked unto the house of God in company; rather, in the throng (Cheyne, Revised Version); i.e. in the midst of the crowd of worshippers. When David went up to the house of God, who is more likely to have accompanied him than his chief \"counsellor\"?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let death seize upon them. As this strophe begins (ver. 9), so it ends, with an imprecation. The psalmist calls on God to bring destruction upon the whole mass of his enemies. Of the two readings in the original, the one adopted by our translators seems the best, \"Let death come suddenly upon them.\" Let them go down quick (i.e. alive) into hell. There is an allusion to the fate of Korah and his company (Numbers 16:30-33), who \"went down quick into the pit;\" but probably the psalmist neither expected nor desired a literal fulfilment of his imprecation. The deaths of Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23) and Absalom (2 Samuel 18:14, 15), and of so many of Absalom's followers (2 Samuel 18:7, 8), were quite a sufficient fulfilment. For wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. (comp. vers. 3, 9-11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-23. - In conclusion, the psalmist turns altogether to God, whom he now addresses as \"Jehovah\" (vers. 16, 22), and expresses his confidence that, in answer to his continual prayers (ver. 17), God will come to his aid, will deliver his soul from the machinations of his enemies, and will visit them with \"affliction\" (ver. 19) and \"destruction\" (ver. 23). Still grieved chiefly by the defection of his unfaithful friend, he once more describes the treachery and heinousness of his conduct (vers. 20. 21), before winding up with a word of comfort for all the righteous (ver. 22), and of menace against all the ungodly (ver. 23). Verse 16. - As for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord (Jehovah) shall save me. The call is upon the God known to man by nature as the Almighty Ruler of the universe; the answer is from the covenant God of Israel, the Self-existent One, in whom Israel trusts. The two are different aspects of one and the same Being.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Evening, and morning (comp. Genesis 1:5, 8, etc.), and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud. From this passage and from Daniel's conduct (Daniel 6:10) we learn that devout Israelites habitually offered prayer to God at these three times of the day. The \"morning \"and \"evening\" devotions were doubtless suggested by the law of the morning and evening sacrifice (Exodus 29:38-42); but the midday prayer, being nowhere commanded, can only be ascribed to natural piety. And he shall hear my voice. Constant unremitting prayer is certain of an answer. Compare the parable of the importunate friend (Luke 11:5-8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me. Once mere \"the preterite of prophetic certainty.\" David sees his deliverance effected. He beholds the coming battle (2 Samuel 17:11; 2 Samuel 18:6-8). He sees that there are many with him; i.e. \"many that contend with him;\" but his courage does not fail - he is assured of being \"delivered\" and re-established in his kingdom \"in peace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - God shall hear, and afflict them; i.e. \"God will hear my prayers, and will afflict my adversaries;\" or, perhaps, \"God will hear me and answer me.\" But this requires a change in the reading. Even he that abideth of old; or, \"he that is enthroned of old;\" he, i.e., that sitteth, and has always sat, on his eternal throne in the heavens. Selah. The \"selah\" here marks probably a pause for adoration of the great and eternal King enthroned in all his glory. Because they have no changes; rather, the men who have no changes - exegetical of \"them\" in the first clause of the verse. The wicked \"have no changes,\" i.e. no great reverses of fortune, until their end comes (see Job 21:7-15). Therefore they fear not God; rather, and who do not fear God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him. Some explain \"he\" as \"the wicked collectively,\" and maintain that in this verse and the next no particular person is pointed at; but it seems better to regard the psalmist as \"suddenly reverting to the fixed and deepest thought in his heart - the treachery of his friend\" (Canon Cook). Ahithophel had put forth his hand against such as were at peace with him.\" He hath broken his covenant. The covenant of friendship with David (ver. 14), not, perhaps, a formal one, but involved in the terms on which they stood one towards the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The words of his mouth wore smoother than butter; literally, smooth were the butters of his mouth - i.e., his flattering utterances. But war was in his heart; literally, but his heart was war. His words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords; i.e. keen, cutting - according to our own idiom, \"like daggers.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Cast thy burden upon the Lord; rather, thy portion - or, the lot assigned thee - that which God has given thee to bear. And he shall sustain thee. God will support thee under the lot which he assigns, however hard it is. He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved; i.e. to be disturbed, shaken, unsettled from their faith in him. Note that these promises are made to the righteous only; and, among them, only to those who cast themselves in full faith upon God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm55:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. We must understand by \"them\" the ungodly, the thought of whom is associated with that of the righteous by the law of contrast. While God sustains and supports the righteous, he \"brings down\" and crushes the ungodly. The \"pit of destruction\" is the grave. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days (comp. Jeremiah 17:1). Of course, the statement is not intended for a universal law, and indeed was probably pointed especially at the \"bloody and deceitful men\" of whom the psalmist had been speaking. The suicide of Ahithophel, and the slaughter of Absalom with so many of his followers, furnished a striking commentary on the statement. But I will trust in thee; i.e. but I, for my part, will put no trust in violence or deceit - I will trust in nothing and no one but God (comp. Psalm 7:1; Psalm 11:1, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.56":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; literally, man panteth after me - like a wild beast after his prey. The contrast is sharp between \"man\" (enosh, \"weak man\") and God (Elohim, \"the Mighty One\"). He fighting daily oppreseeth me; rather, all the day long is he fighting and oppressing me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Mine enemies; literally, my watchers - those who keep a continual guard over me. If David had been seized and made a prisoner by the Philistine lords, this expression would be very appropriate. Would daily swallow me up; rather, pant after me all day. For they be many that fight against me. The \"lords of the Philistines\" were, doubtless, \"many;\" they seem to have, all of them, opposed themselves to David (1 Samuel 29:2-9). O thou Most High. This rendering is now generally abandoned, since marom (מָרום), \"height,\" is nowhere else used in this sense. Dr. Kay, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version render \"proudly;\" Professor Cheyne, \"with high looks.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee; literally, the day when I am afraid. When the day comes that I feel fear stealing over me, by an act of will I (even I, weak as I am) will put my trust in thee (comp. Psalm 7:1; Psalm 11:1; Psalm 18:2, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. ? In God I will praise his word; rather, through God; i.e. \"with God's help, by his grace,\" I am ready to praise whatever sentence he pronounces, whatever flat goes forth from him. In God I have put my trust (so again, ver. 11). This is at once the refrain and the keynote of the psalm. In all dangers, in all troubles, whatever happens, whatever seems to be impending, the psalmist will never relinquish his trust in the Almighty. I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. This is the true martyr spirit. Compare our Lord's words, \"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell\" (Matthew 10:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Every day they wrest my words; rather, all the day long. they wrest (or, torture) my words. They seek to give my words an evil meaning, and so to misrepresent me to Achish, their king. As Canon Cook says, \"This description is singularly applicable to David's position among the envious nobles at the court of Achish Still, it does not speak of his having been actually arrested, and does not, therefore, seem to have suggested the inscription.\" All their thoughts are against his for evil. They are entirely bent on doing the psalmist some hurt. What they really seek is his life (ver. 6); but, short of that, they would gladly do him some mischief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They gather themselves together, they hide themselves; or, \"they gather themselves together; they set an ambush.\" They mark my steps, when they wait for my soul; literally, they, even they, mark my steps; i.e. they themselves, grand as they are, condescend to be spies, and track my footsteps.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Shall they escape by iniquity? Shall they escape God's judgments, the psalmist asks, by their iniquity? Assuredly not. God will prevent such an escape. In thine anger cast down the people, O God; literally, the peoples; i.e. the heathen generally, to whom David's enemies, the Gittites, belong. Though assured that they will not escape, the psalmist, to make assurance doubly sure, prays that they may not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thou tellest my wanderings; i.e. thou, O God, takest account of my wretched wandering life (1 Samuel 21-30), and notest each occasion when I am forced to move from one city, or cave, or wilderness to another. Put thou my tears into thy bottle. Take also note of my tears - let them not pass unheeded. Rather, gather them drop by drop, and store them, as costly wine is stored, in a flask. The thought, thus dressed in a metaphor, was, no doubt (as Professor Cheyne observes), \"Store them up in thy memory.\" Are they not in thy book? i.e. hast thou not anticipated my request, and entered an account of every tear that I have shed, in thy book of records (comp. Psalm 69:28; Psalm 139:16)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me; literally, in the day that I call upon thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In God will I praise his word; rather, through God (see the comment on ver. 4). In the Lord (rather, through the Lord) will I praise his word. Professor Cheyne looks upon this as \"a feeble Jehovistic interpolation, which interrupts the refrain.\" But other commentators see in it a certain force.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.

Verse 12. - Thy vows are upon me, O God. The psalmist, under his affliction, has made vows to God; i.e. promises of thank offerings if God would come to his aid, and save him from his enemies. These vows he considers to be now due, and himself to be under the obligation of paying them. Accordingly, he announces his intention of speedily discharging his obligation - I will render praises (rather, thank offerings) unto thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm56:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling; rather, hast thou not delivered (Revised Version); or, surely thou hast delivered (Professor Cheyne). The psalmist views his entire deliverance as accomplished; nothing remains to be asked for. That I may walk before God in the light of the living; i.e. that henceforth I may be free from trouble, and walk before God in the clear daylight, no longer dwelling in darkness, but in \"the light of life\" (comp. Job 33:30; John 8:12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.57":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm57:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee (compare the preceding psalm, vers. 1 and 4). Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge (see the comment on Psalm 17:8; and comp. Psalm 36:7; Psalm 61:4; Psalm 63:7; Psalm 91:4). The metaphor is first used in Deuteronomy 32:11. Until these calamities (rather, these wickednesses, or these malignities) be overpast. That they will pass away the psalmist has no doubt. What he needs is support while they endure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm57:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will cry unto God most High. In the original, \"unto Elohim 'elyon\" - an expression which only occurs here and in Psalm 78:56. El elyon, however, occurs in Psalm 78:45; as in Genesis 14:18, 19, 22, and Jehovah 'elyon in Psalm 7:18 [Psalm 7:17]. Unto God that performeth all things for me (comp. Psalm 138:8).

The two clauses stand unconnected in the original, which runs, \"He shall send from heaven and save me - my pursuer reproaches - God shall send,\" etc. The second clause is really parenthetic, and, as Dr. Driver says ('Hebrew Verbs,' § 163), \"circumstantial,\" noting the circumstances under which God would take action. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. His mercy, to relieve the psalmist; his truth, to confound the psalmist's enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm57:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - My soul is among lions (comp.

And I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men - literally, I lie on firebands, sons of men - whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. David occupies the cave (of Adullam?), while around him prowl lion-like men, whose fury is like that of firebrands, who threaten to devour him with their sharp teeth, and to pierce his soul with their cruel tongues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm57:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; or, exalt thyself, O God, above the heavens; i.e. show forth thy might in such a signal way that the heavens (i.e. the angels) may stand to gaze at it.

The enemy is still at work, still plotting against the psalmist, still seeking to do him a mischief; but the efforts made are in vain. They only bring the enemy himself into trouble (ver. 6), and cause the psalmist to pour forth a song of joy (vers. 7-11). Verse 6. - They have prepared a net for my steps (comp. Psalm 9:15; Psalm 10:10; Psalm 25:15; Psalm 31:4; Psalm 35:7). These metaphors from the chase are peculiarly appropriate at the time when Saul was \"hunting David upon the mountains\" (1 Samuel 26:20). My soul is bowed down; rather, they have bowed down my soul; literally, he has bowed down; but the alternate use of the singular and the plural, without any real change of subject, is very common. They have digged a pit before me (comp. Psalm 7:15; Psalm 119:85). Into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Here is the first note of triumph - a very familiar note (Psalm 7:15; Psalm 9:15; Psalm 39:8; Psalm 141:10), but one always sounded with marked satisfaction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm57:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; or, my heart is steadfast - it does not doubt or waver, it is firm in its trust on thee.

Awake, psaltery and harp; i.e. awake, my musical instruments and my musical powers, which have slept, as it were, while I was in affliction. I myself will awake early; or, \"will awaken the dawn\" (comp.

Instead of carefully meting out justice to men, after accurately weighing it in the balance of right and equity, you weigh out to them mere wrong and \"violence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. This is the language of hyperbole, and is certainly not the profession of the doctrine of original sin. What the psalmist means is that those who ultimately become heinous sinners, for the most part show, even from their early childhood, a strong tendency towards evil. He implies that with others the case is different. Though there may be in them a corruption of nature (Psalm 51:6), yet, on the whole, they have good dispositions, and present a contrast to the ungodly ones whom he is describing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Their poison is like the poison of a serpent (comp. Psalm 140:3; Song of Sirach 25:15). They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear. The \"adder\" was supposed to be deaf, on account of its being very difficult to charm. It was thought obstinately to set itself against the charmer, and, as it were, stop its ears against him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers. Serpent charmers are alluded to in Ecclesiastes 10:11 and Jeremiah 6:17. They have at all times been common in the East, as they are still in India; and it is with reason suspected that the magicians of Pharaoh employed the art in their contest with Moses and Aaron. Charming never so wisely; literally, though they bind their spells skilfully.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBreak their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-9. - \"Description passes into imprecation, with an 'Elohim' emphatically placed first\" (Cheyne). Metaphors are accumulated. Menace follow menace. The wrath of God is first invoked upon the evil doers (vers. 6-8); then (ver. 9) coming judgment is announced. Verse 6. - Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth. Serpent charmers sometimes, when they have caught their snake, proceed to beat out the poison fangs with a stone or stick (Geike, 'The Holy Land and the Bible,' vol. 1, p. 245). The psalmist, in the first clause, seems to allude to this practice; in the second, he changes the metaphor, reverting to his favourite image of the young lion (kephir). Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord. The \"cheek teeth\" (Joel 1:6), or principal fangs on either side, are intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Let them melt away as waters which run continually; i.e. \"let them waste away, and go to naught, like water, that runs off and accomplishes nothing.\" When he bendoth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces; i.e. \"let the arrows be as though snapped in two, or headless.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - As a snail which molteth, lot every one of them pass away; or, \"let them be as a snail, which melteth and passeth away\" (Revised Version). Snails in Palestine, during dry seasons, often shrink, shrivel up, and disappear from their shells (Tristram, 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 296). Like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun; rather, that hath not seen the sun (Professor Cheyne, Revised Version); i.e. \"let them be as an abortion\" (comp. Job 3:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. This \"difficult and obscure verse\" has been variously explained. Professor Cheyne translates, \"Before your pots can feel the thorns, and while your flesh (i.e. the flesh in the pots, on which you are about to feast) is still raw, the hot wrath of Jehovah shall sweep it away.\" The Revised Version gives the following: \"Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them [i.e. the thorns] away with a whirlwind, the green [thorns] and the burning alike.\" Dr. Kay, \"Before your caldrons have felt the thorn fire, even as raw flesh, even so, shall hot fury sweep him away.\" The general meaning seems to be that before the wicked judges can enjoy the fruits of their wickedness, the fierce wrath of God will come upon them like a tempest, and sweep both them and the produce of their villainy away (comp. 2 Samuel 23:6, 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - In conclusion, the psalmist expresses the satisfaction of the righteous at the punishment of the unjust judges. Verse 10. - The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance. As the good man is pained when he sees the ungodly prosper, so he cannot but feel a certain satisfaction and pleasure when punishment overtakes him. Dante says -NEWLINENEWLINE\"O Signor mio, quando saro io lietoNEWLINEA veder la vendetta, che nascosaNEWLINEFa dolce l'ira tua nel suo segreto?\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Purg.,' 20:94-96.) He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked (comp. Psalm 68:24; Isaiah 63:3). It is observable that David, personally, was too indulgent, rather than too severe, towards offenders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm58:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous. God's righteous judgment being seen in the punishment of the wicked, men will no longer doubt of the ultimate reward of the godly. God must, by his very nature, be more inclined to reward goodness than to punish wickedness. Verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth; rather, verily there is a God, etc. (see Revised Version). Elohim is joined with a plural here, because the speakers are men generally, not only Israelites.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.59":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God. This is David's almost constant cry (see Psalm 7:1; Psalm 17:13; Psalm 22:20; Psalm 25:20; Psalm 31:1, 2, 15; Psalm 35:17; Psalm 40:13; Psalm 43:1; Psalm 69:18; Psalm 70:1, 4; Psalm 109:21, etc.). He has enemies, both domestic and foreign. In his early youth Saul becomes his enemy out of jealousy; then most of Saul's courtiers espouse their master's quarrel, he has enemies at the court of Achish; enemies in his family, even among his sons, as Absalom enemies among his counsellors, as Ahithophel; foreign enemies on all sides of him - Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Amalekites, Syrians, Mesopotamians, etc. Against all of them he invokes God's aid, and by God's aid he triumphs over all. Defend me from them that rise up against me; or, set me on high above them (Kay, Revised Version). David's domestic foes \"rose up against him,\" no less than his foreign foes; made war on him; sought to seize his person, and put him to death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men. Foreign enemies are never reproached with being \"bloody men,\" since war is their trade, and it is their business to wound and slay.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul. The emissaries of Saul were sent to David's house \"to watch him, and to slay him in the morning\" (1 Samuel 19:11). This seems to be the \"lying in wait\" intended. Warned by his wife, Michal, Saul's daughter, David fled from his house during the night through a window, and so saved himself (1 Samuel 19:12). The mighty (or, the strong ones) are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord. Not in consequence of any wrong that I have done. It is noted, as characteristic of David's early psalms, that he protests his absolute innocence in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They run and prepare themselves without my fault; or, \"establish themselves\" - \"take up their position\" (so Hengstenberg, Kay, and Professor Cheyne). Awake to help me (see the comment on Psalm 44:23). And behold; i.e. \"see how things are - how innocent I am; how unjust and cruel are my enemies!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel (comp. Psalm 69:6, also \"a psalm of David\"). Awake to visit all the heathen. \"All\" is emphatic, and means not only those without the covenant, but also those within - the wicked Israelites. It is noted that Saul's instruments consisted of two classes - actual heathen, such as Doeg the Edomite; and irreligious Israelites, as the Ziphites and others, who were no better than heathen. Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. \"The Hebrew words denote treachery and faithlessness\" (Cook). They are scarcely applicable to open foreign enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-9. - \"Here a new stanza begins\" (Cheyne). The \"enemies\" of ver. 1 and the \"workers of iniquity\" of ver. 2 are more elaborately portrayed. First they are represented as \"dogs\" - such hideous, half-wild dogs as frequent Eastern cities, which sleep during the greater part of the day, and rove about in packs at night - unclean, horrid, loathsome animals (ver. 6). Then they appear as men - abusive, slanderous, godless (ver. 7). In conclusion, appeal is made to God against them. He will \"laugh them to scorn\" (ver. 8); and he is a sure Defence against all their efforts (ver. 9). Verse 6. - They return at evening. Having traced David to his house, they disperse for a time, but \"return\" again at evening, and take up their watch (1 Samuel 19:11). They make a noise like a dog; i.e. snarl and growl, quarrelling more or less among themselves during the night time. And go round about the city. Either wander vaguely about, as dogs do for prey, or patrol the walls and gates to see that David does not quit the city, and so escape them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Behold, they belch out with their mouth. All night long they keep uttering abuse and execrations and threats (comp. Psalm 94:4). Swords are in their lips (comp. Psalm 57:4). Speeches that wound and cut to the heart. For who, say they, doth hear! (comp. Psalm 10:11-13; Psalm 64:5; Psalm 73:11; Psalm 94:7). They think themselves irresponsible for their words. No one will hear or know what they say.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them (comp.

There is no \"because of\" in the original, and the reading, \"his strength\" (עזּו), is doubtful. Several manuscripts have \"my strength\" (עזּי), and this reading was followed in all the ancient versions. Most modern critics prefer it, and translate, O my strength, as in ver. 17. Will I wait upon thee; rather, I will wait upon thee. For my God is my Defence; or, my High Tower (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-13. - The enemies are still the main subject. Their pride, their cursing, their lying, are denounced (ver. 12). The psalmist trusts to \"see his desire\" upon them (ver. 10). First he begs that they may not be slain, but only \"scattered abroad,\" so that they may remain as examples of God's vengeance for the warning of others (ver. 11). Then, forgetting this wish, he pleads for their capture and their utter destruction, without which God's glory will not be fully vindicated (vers. 12, 13). Verse 10. - The God of my mercy shall prevent me; or, according to another reading, God with his mercy shall prevent (i.e. anticipate) me. God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies (comp. Psalm 54:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSlay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Slay them not, lest my people forget; i.e. my true people - faithful Israel. The psalmist's \"first thought is, that by lingering on in life for a while the wicked may be more edifying monuments of the Divine anger\" (Cheyne). (For a parallel, see Exodus 9:16.) Scatter them by thy power; or, make them wanderers (comp. Genesis 4:12, 14). It has been often noted that David's curse seems to have passed on to the entire nation of the Jews. And bring them down, O Lord our Shield; i.e. \"cast them down from their honourable positions bring them into misery and disgrace - O Lord, who art our Defense and Shield\" (comp. Psalm 3:3; Psalm 18:2; Psalm 28:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips; rather, the sin of their mouth is each word of their lips (Hupfeld, Cheyne); or, O the sin of their mouth! O the word of their lips! (Ewald, Kay, Canon Cook). Let them even be taken in their pride. Saul's special emissaries (1 Samuel 19:11) would, of course, be proud of their mission. And for cursing and lying which they speak (comp.

The frustration of their plans, and their signal punishment, will cause the God of Israel to be recognized widely as the King of the whole earth. Compare the words of David to Goliath, \"I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel\" (1 Samuel 17:46).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-17. - David here turns back from the future fate of his enemies to their present condition,and repeats ver. 7 verbatim. He thus reminds himself of his existing danger; he is still being sought - they are still in quest of their prey, and will continue so till morning comes (ver. 15). But in the morning he will be gone - he will have escaped them. Upon this thought occurring, he raises a renewed thanksgiving to God (vers. 16, 17) Verse 14. - And at evening let them return; rather, they return, as in ver. 6. And let them make a noise like a dog; rather, they make a noise. And go round about the city. Keeping their watch upon me.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let them wander up and down for meat; rather, they wander up and down for meat. David himself was the prey which they desired. They kept guard around his house, wandering, no doubt, up and down. And grudge if they be not satisfied; rather, as in the margin and in the Revised Version, and if they be not satisfied, they will stay all night. This they appear to have done from 1 Samuel 19:11-15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - But I will sing of thy power; rather, of thy strength - the same word as that used in vers. 9 and 17. Yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning. When the morning came, David had escaped (1 Samuel 19:12), and could \"sing of God's mercy\" securely at Ramah, where he had joined Samuel. For thou hast been my Defense and Refuge in the day of my trouble; or, my High Tower, as in vers. 9 and 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm59:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Unto thee, O my Strength, will I sing: for God is my Defense; or, Strong Tower (comp. ver. 9, which, if we read עזּי for עזו, is so far, excepting in the verb, identical).

David was \"king\" over Israel; but Jehovah was \"King\" over David (comp. Psalm 10:16; Psalm 29:10; Psalm 44:4; Psalm 47:6, etc.). And my God (see Psalm 84:3). For auto thee will I pray.

The appointment of daily morning and evening sacrifice (Numbers 28:4) pointed out morn and eve as times especially appropriate for prayer. A natural instinct suggested the same idea (Job 1:5). In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee. The repetition adds force to the implied injunction (comp. Psalm 130:6). The word translated \"direct my prayer\" means \"arrange\" or \"set in order,\" as the priests did the altar before a sacrifice (Leviticus 1:7, 8, 12; Leviticus 6:5; Numbers 28:4). Prayer is viewed as a sort of sacrificial act. And will look up; or, look out - keep on the watch - in expectation of my prayer being granted (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness. Thou wilt listen to the prayer of a righteous man (Psalm 4:1), since thou dost not delight in wickedness, but in goodness. Neither shall evil dwell with thee. Light has no fellowship with darkness. Evil men can obtain no support from thee, who art All-holy. They will scarcely venture to ask thy aid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The foolish (or, the arrogant - \"the boasters\") shall not stand in thy light. Rather shall they be cast down and dismayed (Psalm 73:3, 18). Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. David has in mind the wicked and presumptuous men who have handed themselves together against him, and \"take his contrary part\" (Psalm 109:3, Prayer-book Version). These he is sure that God hates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing (comp.

God's vengeance was sure to fall upon them, either in this world or in the next. The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. An individual seems to be pointed at, who is probably Ahithophel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But... I will come into thy house; rather, unto thy house. David, as a layman, would not be entitled to enter within the tabernacle. He would draw near to it, probably bring his offering, and then worship toward it (see the following clause). In the multitude of thy mercy; or, through the abundance of thy mercy (comp. Psalm 69:13, 16). It was by God's mercy that David lived, that he was maintained in health and strength, that he had a desire to go to God's house, and was permitted to worship there. Of all these mercies he is deeply sensible. And in thy fear will I worship. David's worship is never without fear - a reverent sense of God's greatness, power, and perfect holiness. Toward thy holy temple. \"David would, according to the custom of the worship then established, turn himself in the time of prayer to the place where the gracious presence of the Lord had its seat\" (Hengstenberg; scrap. Psalm 28:2; Psalm 138:7; 1 Kings 8:30, 33, 38, 42, 44, 48; Daniel 6:10; Jonah 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness. Here at last we find what David prayed for. Previously, we have only heard him entreat that his prayer may be heard (vers. 1, 2), declare that he will pray early (ver. 3), and before the tabernacle (ver. 7); now we learn what his prayer is. It is that God will lead him in the path of his righteousness - that righteousness of which he is the pattern, and whereof he approves; and will \"make his way plain for him,\" i.e. show it him clearly, so that he cannot mistake it. God is asked to do this, especially because of David's enemies, or of \"those that lie in wait for him\" (Revised Version margin), lest, if he were to make a false step, they should triumph over him, and so he should bring discredit upon the cause of God and of his saints. Make thy way straight (plain, Revised Version) before my face. Not so much \"smooth my way,\" or \"make it level\" or \"easy,\" as \"put it plainly before me\" (scrap. Psalm 25:5; and Psalm 27:11, '\"Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; or, no steadfastness - \"no sincerity\" (Kay, Cheyne); see the comment on ver. 6. Their inward part is very wickedness; literally, wickednesses; i.e. nothing but wickedness. Their throat is an open sepulchre. \"Emitting the noisome exhalations of a putrid heart\" (Bishop Horns). They flatter with their tongue; literally, they make smooth their tongues, which may, perhaps, include flattery, but points rather to smooth arguments, specious reasonings, and the habit of making the worse appear the better cause (see the comment of Bishop Horsley, 'Book of Psalms,' vol. 1. pp. 154, 155). The last two clauses of this verse are quoted by St. Paul (Romans 3:13), and applied generally to the character of the ungodly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDestroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Destroy thou them, O God; rather, condemn them, or declare them guilty (Kay); κρῖνον αὐτούς (LXX.). Let them fall by their own counsels. No condemnation naturally follows punishment. David assumes that God will make his enemies fall; he prays that they may fall from the effect of their own counsels. The fate of Ahithophel (2 Samuel 17:23) perhaps fulfilled this imprecation. Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; Thrust them out (Revised Version); \"Thrust them down\" (Kay). Punish them at once, in the midst of their many transgressions. For they have rebelled against thee. They have sinned, not against me only, but equally - nay, far more - against thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice. David is fond of contrasts. Here he sots the lot of the righteous over against that of the wicked. While the wicked \"fall,\" and are \"cast out,\" or \"thrust down' to hell, the righteous \"rejoice \" - nay, ever shout for joy, displaying their feelings in the true Oriental manner. Because thou defendest them. There is no \"because\" in the original. The passage runs on without any change of construction, \"Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice; let them ever shout for joy, and do thou defend them; and let them that love thy Name be joyful in thee.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous. All the joy of the righteous springs from the fact that God's blessing is upon them. The sense of his favour fills their hearts with rejoicing. With favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield. Tsinnah (צִנָּה)is the large, long shield that protected the whole body (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 445). God's favour, thus encompassing a man, effectually secured him against all dangers.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.60":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O God, thou hast east us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased (comp. Psalm 44:9-11). The expressions used imply a signal defeat, which, though not mentioned in the historical books, harmonizes with the account given in 1 Kings of the severe treatment of Edom by Joab. From the fact of the defeat the psalmist infers the ground of it - God's displeasure. O turn thyself to us again; rather, O restore to us (i.e. make restoration to us) again (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou hast made the earth (rather, the land) to tremble. The blow struck convulsed the whole land - i.e. the people in it. It is not really an earthquake, but a panic fear, that is intended. Thou hast broken it; or, rent it. The imagery of an earthquake is kept up. Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. The panic fear still continued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou hast showed thy people hard things; literally, a hard thing, or harshness; i.e. severity. Thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment; or, of trembling (as in Isaiah 51:17, 22); comp. Psalm 75:8; Jeremiah 25:15-17: 49:12; Ezekiel 23:32-34; Zechariah 12:2. The outpouring of Divine vengeance is represented under the figure of presenting a cup, which the doomed man is forced to drink.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou hast given a tanner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. So most commentators. But the ancient rendering, recently revived by Professor Cheyne, is perhaps preferable. According to this, the meaning is, \"Thou hast indeed given a banner to them that fear thee (see Exodus 17:15), but only that they may flee before the bow\" (τοῦ φυγεῖν ἀπὸ προωσ´που τόξων, LXX.). On the last occasion that the banner had been lifted, it had seemed to be, not so much a rallying point, as a signal for dispersion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me; rather, hear us. From complaint (vers. 1-4) the psalmist abruptly turns to prayer, thus closing the first strophe with a gleam of hope.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-8. - Appeal is next made in God's promises. Some suppose that a Divine oracle had been recently given to David himself, and that he here records the words of it. But, in that case, it is difficult to account for the despondent tone of vers. 1-4. Hengstenberg's explanation seems preferable, that David now encourages himself by a \"reference to the general aspect of the assurances given in the Pentateuch in regard to the possession of the land of Canaan in its widest extent, and to victory over hostile neighbours,\" and that he has his eye especially on the blessing of Jacob (Genesis 49) and the blessing of Moses (Deuteronomy 33). If these assurances are to be depended on, Israel cannot now be about to succumb to Edom. Verse 6. - God hath spoken in his holiness; or, promised by his holiness (comp. Psalm 89:35). As God is holy, he cannot falsify his promises. I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth; i.e. I will distribute Canaan among my people - both the western region, of which Shechem was the chief town (1 Kings 12:25), and the eastern, which contained \"the valley of Succoth\" (Genesis 33:17). God, having assigned the whole laud to his people (Genesis 13:14, 15), \"meted it out\" through Joshua, his servant, and gave to each tribe its inheritance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine. Gilead was an old name for the territory beyond the Jordan (Genesis 37:25), especially the more northern portion of it. Manasseh had a portion of this territory assigned to him (Numbers 32:39-42; Joshua 17:1). But Manasseh had also a large inheritance on the western side of Jordan (Joshua 17:7-11). It is not quite clear whether both the divisions of Manasseh, or the eastern one only, is here intended. Ephraim also is the strength of mine head. Ephraim was the most important of the tribes next to Judah, and held the central position in the western region, forming the main strength of the northern kingdom after the separation under Jeroboam (see 1 Kings 12:25; and comp. Isaiah 7:2, 5, 9, 17; Isaiah 9:21; Hosea 4:17; Hosea 5:7-14; Hosea 6:4-10, etc.). Judah is my lawgiver (comp. Genesis 49:10; Numbers 21:17); i.e. \"my ruling tribe\" - the tribe to which I have committed the government of my people\" (see 1 Samuel 16:1; 2 Samuel 2:4; 2 Samuel 5:1-3; Psalm 78:68).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moab is my washpot. A term of extreme contempt (see Herod., 2:172). The subjugation of Moab was prophesied by Balaam (Numbers 24:17), and effected by David (2 Samuel 8:2). Over Edom will I cast out my shoe. The reference to Ruth 4:7, 8, which is commonly made, is very doubtful. Probably no more is intended than that Edom will be a slave of so low a rank as only to clean the shoes of its master. The subjugation of Edom, like that of Moab, had been prophesied by Balaam (Numbers 24:18). Philistia, triumph thou because of me. The context will not allow of this rendering, since Philistia, like the other enemies of Israel, must be triumphed over, and not triumph. Translate, over Philistia is my triumphing (comp. Psalm 108:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9-12. - Rehearsal of God's promises has raised the psalmist out of despondency, and he can now confidently call God to his assistance. Edom is to be conquered, for so God has premised (ver. 8). But how? Who will lead out Israel's armies? Will God, who has lately \"cast Israel off\"? If not, it must he man. But \"vain is the help of man\" (ver. 11). So the call is made that God will give help in the trouble - and with the call comes full confidence - and the triumphant cry goes forth, \"Through God we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies\" (ver. 12). Verse 9. - Who will bring me into the strong city? The \"strong city\" of Edom was Sela, \"The Cliff\" - now Petra. And it was a city of enormous strength, rock hewn in the main, and guarded by frightful precipices. Who will conduct me through its strong natural and artificial defences, and give me possession of the place? Who will lead me into Edom? Who will even bring me into the country? The Edomites, flushed with their recent victory, will, of course, dispute my entrance. Who will enable me to overcome their resistance?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? rather, Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? Can we expect thee to lead us, when thou hast so lately cast us off, and, as we hear it said on all sides, dost not go out with our armies? A reference, perhaps, to Psalm 44:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Give us help from trouble. Faith combats doubt, and, overcoming it, finds an utterance - \"Give us help now, whatever thou hast done in the past.\" Our trouble is great. \"Help us from it.\" For vain is the help of man. We have, therefore, no hope but in thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm60:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrough God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Through God we shall do valiantly. No miracle is expected or asked for. Let God look upon us favourably - let his light shine into our hearts, and then \"we ourselves shall do valiantly\" - we shall gain the victory - we shall accomplish the prophecy of Balaam (Numbers 24:18); and Edom shall pass into our possession. (For the fulfilment, see 2 Samuel 8:14; 1 Chronicles 18:13.) For he it is that shall tread down our enemies (comp. Psalm 44:5), which has the same meaning, \"Through thy Name will we tread them under that rise up against us.\" (For the extent to which Edom was trodden down, see 1 Kings 11:15, 16.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.61":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm61:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Hear my cry, O God (see the comment on Psalm 17:1).

Eastern hyperbole may call the Trans-Jordanic territory \"the end of the earth,\" but certainly the expression would be more natural in the mouth of an exile in Assyria, Media, or Babylon. When my heart is overwhelmed; or, \"when my heart fainteth\" (comp. Psalm 107:5). Lead me to the rock that is higher than I; rather, that is too high for me - that I cannot reach unaided. Some regard the \"rock\" as Mount Zion; but others, more reasonably, explain it as \"God himself\" (see Psalm 62:2, 6, 7). \"Let thy grace lead me to thee\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm61:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For thou hast been a Shelter for me. In the past thou hast often been my \"Shelter\" or my \"Refuge\" (comp. Psalm 18:2; Psalm 44:7, 11; Psalm 48:3, etc.); be so once more. And a strong Tower. A migdal - a fortress, like the great fortress of the south (Exodus 14:2) - the Magdolus of Herodotus (2:149). From the enemy. If the psalm is David's, \"the enemy\" is probably Absalom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm61:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will abide in thy tabernacle forever. As the psalmist is in exile, at \"the end of the earth\" (ver. 2), the literal \"tabernacle\" cannot be intended. A spiritual abiding in the heavenly dwelling, whereof the tabernacle was a type, must be meant (comp. Psalm 18:11). I will trust in the covert of thy wings (comp. Psalm 17:8; Psalm 36:7; Psalm 57:1; Psalm 63:7; Psalm 91:4). The origin of the metaphor is hardly to be sought in the outspread wings of the cherubim on the mercy seat; rather in the brooding wings of birds protecting and defending their young (Deuteronomy 32:11; Matthew 23:37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm61:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For thou, O God, hast heard my vows.

Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy Name. All the blessed inheritance of thy saints thou hast made mine, and, included in it, boldness to approach the throne of grace in full assurance of faith, and to present to thee my petitions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm61:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou wilt prolong (or, mayest thou prolong) the king's life. The question arises - What king? Some answer that David prays for the extension of his own life; or, if not exactly of his own life, then for the prolongation of his dynasty upon the throne (Hengstenberg); others suggest that a distant exile, perhaps in Assyria, prays for the life of the reigning King of Judah, Josiah probably ('Four Friends,' p. 117); but the Messianic interpretation is perhaps the best. The writer, lifted up above himself and above sublunary things, abiding, as he does, in the spiritual tabernacle under the shelter of God's wings (ver. 4), prays for long continuance of days for the true King, the ideal King, Messiah, of whom David and his house are types: \"Mayest thou add days to the days of the King,\" and make his years as many generations; or, as generation and generation; i.e. eternally continuous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm61:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He shall abide (or, may he abide) before God forever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him; literally, appoint that mercy and truth may preserve him.

This, if thou doest, then I, for my part, so long as I have my being, will praise thy Name, thus performing day by day what I have vowed.

The initial word, ak (אַך), which occurs six times in this psalm (vers. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9), is best translated \"only\" in every instance. It always intensifies the word or phrase to which it is attached - \"only upon God\" - \"only he\" - \"only from his excellency\" - \"only vanity.\" From him cometh my salvation (comp. Psalm 35:3; Psalm 37:39; Psalm 65:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He only is my Rock (comp.

Attack him, that is - seek to do him grievous hurt, as ye are attacking me. Ye shall be slain all of you; rather, that ye may crush him, all of you together. The hope of the conspirators under Absalom was in their united strength. As a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence. The words supplied in the Authorized Version should be omitted. It is David who is viewed by his enemies as a bulged wall (see Isaiah 30:15) or a tottering fence, which it requires only a strong push to throw down.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.

They delight in lies. Some indication of the \"lies\" circulated against David at this Time is given in 2 Samuel 15:3-5; 2 Samuel 16:7, 8. They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly; literally, they bless with his mouth, which may be explained as meaning either, \"They bless, each of them, with his mouth\" (Kay, Cheyne), or \"they Bless through the mouth of their leader \" - i.e. Ahithophel (Canon Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-8. - From the thought of his bitter enemies and their wicked machinations against him, the psalmist returns to expressions of his own full confidence in God - first falling back on almost the identical words of his opening stanza (comp. vers. 5, 6 with vers. 1, 2); then slightly varying them (ver. 7); and finally commending trust and confidence to the remnant of the people who continue faithful to God and to his anointed (ver. 8). Verse 5. - My soul, wait thou only upon God. Compare the opening words of the psalm, which are nearly identical. For my expectation is from him. \"Expectation\" here takes the place of \"salvation\" in ver. 1. Otherwise there is no difference. The God who has given salvation in the past is the Being from whom it is expected in the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He only is my Rock and my Salvation; he is my Defence; I shall not be moved. Identical with ver. 2, except in the omission of the single word \"greatly.\" The psalmist's confidence has increased. He feels now that, whatever his enemies may attempt, he will not be shaken at all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - In God is my salvation and my glory. The last phrase is new. The psalmist feels that the God who saves him, at the same time sheds on him glory and honour. The Rock of my strength, and my Refuge, is in God (comp. Psalm 9:9; Psalm 57:2; Psalm 94:22, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Trust in him at all times, ye people. It is characteristic of David to join the \"people\" with himself in all his fears and in all his hopes. Even at the worst times, God had always some faithful ones in Israel - a \"remnant\" (Isaiah 1:9); and men of this sort clung to David through all his perils, and were sufficiently numerous to constitute a \"people\" (see 2 Samuel 18:1-6). Pour out your heart before him (comp. Psalm 42:4; Psalm 142:2, etc.): God is a Refuge for us (comp. ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - \"Here the psalmist becomes didactic\" (Professor Cheyne). He encourages the faithful, and warns the wicked, by the declaration that men of every sort \"are but vanity\" - have no strength, no permanence - while power belongs only to God. Those who \"oppress\" and \"rob\" are, consequently, not to be feared - there is no strength in riches - God alone determines the issues of things. Unto him belongs mercy, or loving kindness - a quality which leads him not only to forgive men their transgressions, but to \"reward\" them, when, by his assisting grace, they have done good works. Verse 9. - Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; rather, only vanity - or, nought but vanity - are men of low degree; common men, as we call them - mere sons of Adam. This is too evident for dispute; but, in the view of the psalmist, this is not the worst. \"Men of high degree\" (beney ish) are no better - they are \"a lie\" - an unreality - a fading, false illusion. To be laid in the balance; rather, in the balance, they go up (Hupfeld, Ewald Hitzig, Revised Version). They are altogether lighter than vanity; or, altogether made out of vanity (Kay); i.e. there is no substance, no solidity, in them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTrust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Trust not in oppression (comp. ver. 3). The class that supported Absalom was the class of oppressors in Israel, whom David kept under and restrained as far as possible. The writer warns them against trusting in their power to oppress, since such strength as they have is not their own, but lent them by God. And become not vain in robbery; or, rely not vainly on robbery (Kay). Do not suppose that God will allow you to continue oppressing and robbing. Such a belief is a vain illusion. If riches increase, set not your heart upon them. Even when wealth accumulates naturally, and not as the result of ill-doing, it is not a thing to be trusted or set store by.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this (comp.

God, i.e., is the only ultimate Source of all power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm62:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy; or, loving kindness. \"Of Divine power all nature speaks; the knowledge of God's mercy rests mainly on revelation\" (Kay).

Soul and body equally long for God, and especially desire to worship him in the sanctuary (ver. 2). In a dry and thirsty (or, weary) land, where no water is.

The \"marrow and fatness\" of the sacrificial feasts caused a delight to worshippers, which was no doubt partly sensuous. The memory of them occurs to the psalmist, but only as the shadow and emblem of the far deeper joy and satisfaction which he finds in the spiritual worship of the Most High, and especially in the offering of praise and thanksgiving. And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips; or, while my mouth praiseth thee (see the Prayer book Version, which brings out the true sense).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm63:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.

Professor Cheyne notes that \"the psalmist has no sense of any incongruity between deeply spiritual musings and vehement denunciations of his enemies.\" And this is certainly true. But it is to be remembered that he views his enemies, not merely as his own fees, but as the foes of God and of Israel. As the servant of God, he must hate those who are opposed to God; as the King of Israel, he must hate those who seek to injure and ruin his people. He does not, however, desire for them suffering or torment; he only asks that they may be removed from this sphere into another world.

The \"king,\" thus suddenly introduced, cannot be an entirely new personage, unknown to the rest of the psalm, and, therefore, must be the composer, speaking of himself in the third person (comp. Psalm 18:50; Psalm 72:1). Every one that sweareth by him (i.e. by God) shall glory; or, shall triumph (Kay). Those who swear by the Name of God show themselves to be believers in God, and will be upheld by him in time of danger (see Deuteronomy 6:13; Isaiah 65:16). But the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. (On the falsehoods told by David's enemies, see 2 Samuel 15:3; 2 Samuel 16:7, 8; and comp.

Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. David already feels that it is not his deposition only, but his life, that is sought (comp. 2 Samuel 15:14; 2 Samuel 17:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity. The first danger is from secret plots, which David knows to be going on against his authority (2 Samuel 15:1-12). The second, and greater danger, will be from open insurrection (2 Samuel 17:1-14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Who whet their tongue like a sword (comp. Psalm 55:21; Psalm 57:4; Psalm 59:7). And bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words (comp. Psalm 11:2; Psalm 57:4). Calumny was what David especially feared, and what actually brought about his downfall (see 2 Samuel 15:2-6). The \"bitterness\" of his enemies is further emphasized by the speeches and curses of Shimei (2 Samuel 16:5-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - That they may shoot in secret at the perfect; or, in their hiding places. David does not scruple to call himself \"perfect,\" using the word in the sense in which it is used of Job (Job 1:1; Job 2:3), meaning a sincere and upright man. Suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. They are not afraid, though it is \"the anointed of the Lord,\" whom to attack is not only rebellion, but sacrilege (see 2 Samuel 1:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They encourage themselves in an evil matter; or, in an evil scheme - the plan of making David unpopular, and then raising the standard of open revolt against him (2 Samuel 15:1-12). They commune of laying snares privily. The ungodly continually set traps for the righteous, who are so simple that they often fall into them. We do not know the exact proceedings of his enemies against David at the time, the narrative of 2 Samuel 15 being so brief; but it was probably by some trickery that David was induced to quit the stronghold of Jerusalem, and so yield the seat of government, and many other advantages, to his rival. They say, Who shall see them? (comp. Psalm 10:11; Psalm 59:7; Psalm 94:7). It is an inveterate folly for men to imagine, either that God will not see their actions, or that he will pay no heed to them. A spurious humility is brought into play in the latter case - How can it be supposed that God will note the doings of such worms as men?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search; rather, they devise iniquities. We have accomplished (they say) a well devised device. So modern critics generally (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, Canon Cook, Revised Version). Both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep. Therefore the righteous man is in great danger from them, unless God interpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But God shall shoot at them with an arrow. But God will interpose. As they have shot with their arrows at the righteous (ver. 3), so with his arrow shall God shoot at them. Suddenly shall they be wounded. The first word, \"suddenly,\" may belong equally well either to the preceding or to the following clause. The result is all that is important. Not the righteous, but they themselves, shall receive the wound; literally, their wound shall be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves; rather, so shall they be made to stumble; their own tongue shall be against them. The tongue, which they \"whetted like a sword,\" shall be the principal means of bringing them into trouble (see 2 Samuel 17:1-23). All that see them shall flee away; rather, shall wag the head (Cheyne, Revised Version) in derision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God. The fate of David's enemies shall cause widespread fear and alarm. Men shall perceive God's hand in it, and shall be led, in consequence, to declare \"God's work.\" The tragic ends of Ahithophel and Absalom were certainly well calculated to impress the minds of men generally, and to strike awe into the hearts of those who had looked with indifference, or even, perhaps, with satisfaction, on the political troubles. For they shall wisely consider of his doing; rather, for they shall understand his operation. They shall understand, i.e., that God is on the side of the righteous, and, when danger presses, will interpose on their behalf, to the terrible discomfiture of the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm64:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him. The righteous, delivered from their imminent peril, naturally \"rejoice in the Lord,\" i.e. rejoice in God's goodness to them, and feel their confidence in him increased. And all the upright in heart shall glory (comp. Psalm 32:11; Psalm 58:11).

There was, for the most part, a hushed silence in the tabernacle and temple, amid which silent prayer and praise were offered to God by the priests and Levites, and any lay persons who might be present (camp. 1 Samuel 1:13). And unto thee shall the vow be performed. When there was any special outpouring of praise in the temple, there would almost always be a performance of vows. Both depended on some deliverance or favour having been granted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - O thou that hearest prayer. A necessary and inalienable attribute of God. Calvin rightly observes on the passage: \"God can no more divest himself of his attribute of hearing prayer than of being.\" Unto thee shall all flesh come. \"All flesh\" might certainly, in a psalmist's mouth, mean no more than \"all Israel\" (so Ewald and Hitzig). But the context (especially in vers. 5 and 8) shows that in this psalm the writer is universalist in his ideas, and embraces all mankind in his hopes and aspirations (comp. Psalm 22:27, 28; Psalm 86:9; Isaiah 66:23; Jeremiah 16:19; Joel 2:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Iniquities prevail against me. Not so much, perhaps, his own iniquities, as these of his nation. Compare the expression, \"our transgressions,\" in the next clause. As for our trangressions, thou shalt purge them away; or, cover them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Blessed is the man whom thou choosest. The \"choosing\" intended is certainly not that of the seed of Aaron (Leviticus 8:1), or of the seed of Levi (Numbers 18:21-23), but that act by which God \"chose\" Israel out of all the nations of the earth to be \"a special people unto himself\" (Deuteronomy 7:6), and gave them a distinct position, and peculiar privileges. And causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts. Among the peculiar privileges, one of the greatest was that of approaching God's presence in his holy temple, and entering his \"courts\" and worshipping there. This all Israelites were not only permitted, but commanded to do, at least three times in the year, while the dwellers in Jerusalem, privileged above the rest, had constant opportunities of attending, and using to the full the means of grace provided for them in the sanctuary. We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple. In \"the goodness of God's house\" the psalmist includes, not only the delights there experienced, but also all the blessings which God gives to those who devoutly worship him there - \"from the forgiveness of sins to outward, temporal mercies\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - By terrible things in righteousness (i.e. \"by terrible acts of righteous judgment upon our enemies\") wilt thou answer us. This is a sequel to ver. 2. As God hears prayer and answers it, so when his people cry to him for protection and deliverance from their foes, the result can only be righteous judgments of a fearful character upon the persecutors. O God of our salvation; i.e. God through whom we obtain salvation. Who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth (see the comment on ver. 2, and comp. ver. 8).

The mountains set forth his majesty and permanence (ver. 6); the seas and waves, his power to control and subdue (ver. 7); the outgoings of the morning and evening - sunrise and sunset - his gracious loving kindness (ver. 8). Verse 6. - Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains (comp. Psalm 36:6; Psalm 95:4; Amos 4:13). The mountains are an emblem of God's strength and firmness and fixedness. They stand up in still and silent majesty; they seem as if they could never be moved. He who created them must be girded with power (camp. Psalm 93:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Which stllleth the noise of the seas. The power of God, as set forth in his control of the sea, is a favourite topic with the sacred writers (see Job 38:8; Proverbs 8:29; Isaiah 50:2; Isaiah 51:10; Jeremiah 5:22, etc.). Being so entirely beyond his own control, it seems to man one of the greatest of marvels that there should be any force capable of subduing and taming it, Hence the admiration excited by our Lord's miracle (Matthew 8:26, 27). The noise of their waves (comp. Isaiah 17:12). And the tumult of the people. This clause may seem a little out of place in a passage which treats of God's power over nature. But, after all, humanity is a constituent part of nature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid of thy tokens; g.e. they see thy tokens - indications of thy mighty power - and are filled with awe. Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening (or, the portals of morn and eve - the gateways through which the sun comes forth each morning and retires each evening) to rejoice; ¢.e. to gladden mankind, to spread joy and gladness over the earth. The splendour of sunrise and sunset are in the poet's mind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-13. - In conclusion, the psalmist praises God for his bountiful providence with respect to the harvest. According to some, the whole poem is essentially a harvest thanksgiving, and the poet now \"comes at last to the point aimed at from the first.\" He traces the whole process by which the glorious termination is arrived at. First, the \"early rain\" descending from \"the river of God,\" or the reservoir for rain which God guards in the heavens (Job 38:37), moistening the furrows, softening the ridges, and preparing the land for the seed-corn. Then the sowing, which, being man's work, is but just touched on (ver. 9, ad fin.). After that, the \"latter rain\" - the gentle showers of March and April - which cause the grain to burst and the blade to spring, and the ear to form itself, and turn the dull fallow into a mass of greenery (vers. 10, 12). At last, the full result - pastures clothed with flocks; valleys, the \"long broad sweeps between parallel ranges of hills,\" covered over with corn; all nature laughing and shouting for joy (ver. 13). Verse 9. - Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it (comp. Job 36:27, 28; Job 37:6; Job 38:26-28; Psalm 147:18; Jeremiah 5:24; Matthew 5:45). Thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God. There is no \"with\" in the original; and the two clauses are better taken separately. Translate, Thou greatly enrichest it; the river of God is full of water. By \"the river of God\" is to be understood God's store of water in the clouds and atmosphere, which he can at any time retain or let loose. Thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it; rather, when thou hast so prepared her (the earth). By thus preparing the earth for the sowing. God prepares for men the corn which they ultimately obtain at the harvest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly; rather, the furrows (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). Thou settlest the furrows thereof; rather, thou smoothest down its ridges. So covering up the grain, and bringing the rough ploughed land to a comparatively smooth surface. Thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof. The whole ground being softened with warm showers, the springing of the blade begins under God's blessing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou crownest the year with thy goodness. As God had begun, so he goes on to the \"crowning\" of the whole. And thy paths drop fatness. As he moves about, visiting the earth (ver. 9), there drop from him fertility and abundance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness; rather, the pastures of the wilderness drip with it; i.e. with the \"fatness\" which is shed from God's presence. And the little hills rejoice on every side; literally, are girded with joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm65:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The pastures are clothed with flocks; or, with their flocks; i.e. the flocks befitting them. The valleys also are covered over with corn. The great open sweeps between the ranges of hills are completely covered over with grain crops, wheat, barley, millet; and the result is that they seem to shout for joy, they also sing. This is better than the rendering of Ewald and Delitzsch, \"Man shouts for joy; he sings.\" All the poets personify Nature, and make her sympathize with human kind (comp. Isaiah 14:8; Isaiah 35:1; Isaiah 55:12; Virg., ' Eclog.,' 5:62; ' Georg.,' 4:461).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.66":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands; literally, all the earth - an invitation to the whole world to join in the joy of Israel, wherein they too are interested (comp.

God's deliverances, while rejoicing the persecuted, are \"terrible\" to the persecutors. Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.

The passage of the Red Sea at the time of the Exodus was one of the most wonderful of God's works. To the Israelites it was altogether a matter of joy and rejoicing (see Exodus 15:1-21). But how terrible a thing was it to the Egyptians! \"The waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them\" (Exodus 14:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves.

God keeps perpetual watch upon the heathen nations, whose general attitude is that of hostility to his \"peculiar people,\" lest his people should suffer at their hands. Although they may professedly be submissive (ver. 3), their submission is not to be depended on. Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. At any time rebellion may break out, his people be attacked, and \"the nations\" endeavour to \"exalt themselves.\" All such attempts, however, will be in vain, since \"by his power God ruleth forever.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-15. - Here we reach the heart of the psalm. The people are called upon to praise God for a recent deliverance from a long period of severe affliction and oppression at the hand of enemies (vers. 8-12), and to join in the sacrifices which are about to be offered to God in payment of the vows made during the time of trouble (vers. 13-15). As the writer ascribes to himself both the making of the vows and the offering of the sacrifices, he must have been the leader of the nation at the time of the oppression and of the deliverance. Verse 8. - O bless our God, ye people; literally, ye peoples - but the plural form here can scarcely point to the \"nations,\" who have just been called, not 'ammim, but goim (see ver. 7). And make the voice of his praise to be heard (comp. Psalm 33:3; cf. 5).

Professor Cheyne translates \"into the dungeon.\" But m'tsudah has nowhere else this meaning. It is always either \"a net\" or \"a stronghold.\" Thou laidst affliction upon oar loins; or, a sore burden (Revised Version). The meaning is, \"Thou crushedst us down under a heavy weight of oppression.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads. See the Egyptian and Assyrian sculptures passim, where the king in his chariot gallops over the bodies of his dead and wounded enemies. We went through fire and through water; i.e. through dangers of every kind - a proverbial expression (comp. Isaiah 43:2). But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place; or, \"a place of refreshment\" (εἰς ἀναψυχήν, LXX.). Dr. Kay renders, \"a place of rich comfort;\" Professor Cheyne, \"a place of liberty\" (comp.

In the old world the strict performance of vows was always held to be one of the main obligations of religion. A vow was of the nature of a compact with God, and to break it was an act of flagrant dishonesty, from which men shrank. The Mosaic Law sanctioned vows of various kinds, as the vowing of children to the service of God (Leviticus 27:1-8; 1 Samuel 1:11); the vow of the Nazarite (Numbers 6:2-21); and vows of clean or unclean animals (Leviticus 27:9-13, 27-29), etc. Clean animals, when vowed, must be either redeemed or sacrificed. The importance of performing vows is borne frequent witness to by the psalmists (see Psalm 22:25; Psalm 50:14; Psalm 56:12; Psalm 61:8; Psalm 65:1; Psalm 116:14, 18; Psalm 132:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.

It has been because his prayers and vows proceeded from a sincere and honest heart, one which was free from \"iniquity\" (ver. 18). As Hengstenberg points out, this portion of the psalm is didactic, and inculcates the lesson \"that there is no way of salvation except that of well doing.\" God, by answering the psalmist's prayer, and giving the deliverance for which he had entreated, had set his testimony to the fact of the psalmist's integrity (vers. 19, 20). Verse 16. - Come and hear, all ye that fear God. The address is scarcely to all that have any sense of religion anywhere, as Professor Cheyne suggests, but rather to the religious section of his own nation - the \"righteous\" or \"godly\" of other psalms. They are invited to draw near, and be received into the psalmist's confidence. And I will declare what he hath done for my soul. What God had done for the psalmist was to give him confidence and assurance. He knew that his prayers would be ineffectual unless his heart was pure. God heard him, and then he became sure that he was free from the \"great transgression\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue; rather, and praise was under my tongue; i.e. I was so confident of being heard that a song of praise was already in my mouth, on the point of bursting forth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. This is the inward conviction of every simple, unsophisticated soul. It is confirmed by numerous passages of Holy Writ (Job 27:9; Job 31:27; Proverbs 15:29; Proverbs 28:9; Isaiah 1:15; Zechariah 7:13; John 9:31, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - But verily God hath heard me. The psalmist's prayer had been answered so unmistakably, so directly, that he could not doubt of the result, which had been brought about, being the consequence of his vows and supplications (vers. 13. 14). He hath attended to the voice of my prayer. Strange as it might seem to be that God had attended to the voice of a man (Job 7:17; Psalm 8:4; Psalm 144:3; James 5:14-18), yet so it was; the psalmist did not and could not doubt it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm66:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me. The psalm of thanksgiving appropriately concludes with a special blessing of God by the psalmist, who felt that such especial mercy had been shown to himself (vers. 16-20).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.67":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm67:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - God be merciful unto us, and bless us. An echo of the priestly blessing (Numbers 6:24, 25), but not necessarily uttered by a priest. The substitution of Elohim for Jehovah is natural, considering the universalist character of the psalm. And cause his face to shine upon us; literally, with us. \"With us\" especially, as the people of God; but not \"with us\" exclusively, as the whole psalm makes manifest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm67:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That thy way may he known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. God is besought to bless his people Israel (ver. 1), in order that so his \"way\" may become known to all the earth, his \"saving health,\" or his \"salvation,\" to all (heathen) nations. The idea is not raised of any compulsory empire, but of one which will gradually extend itself, by winning the heathen over to it through the sight of Israel's blessedness (comp. Isaiah 49:18-23; Isaiah 60:3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm67:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee; rather, the peoples, in both clauses.

There could be no greater blessing to the nations than their attraction into God's kingdom; nor, consequently, any event more worthy to be hailed with joyful acclaim, with songs of joy and thanksgiving. For thou shalt judge the people (rather, the peoples) righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. The main advantage of the change would be the bringing of the heathen into that kingdom of perfect righteousness, wherein God (in the Person of Christ) would dispense justice unerringly, and rule all men with perfect and absolute equity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm67:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. A repetition of ver. 3 without any change.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm67:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Then shall the earth yield her increase; literally, the land hath given her increase - a quotation from Leviticus 26:4, but probably in a metaphorical sense. An abundant spiritual harvest is seen by the psalmist as the result of the entrance of the Gentiles into the Church - an immense \"increase\" in the fruits of righteousness hitherto yielded - and this is spoken of as a result already obtained, through the perfect assurance of the writer that his prayers are granted and the result determined on in the Divine counsels. And God, even our own God, shall bless us. \"Our own God\" must certainly be Jehovah; but the writer, in his broad universalism, will not use the expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm67:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - God shall bless us; or, \"may God bless us\" (Kay, Cheyne); but the form is identical with that used in ver. 6. And all the ends of the earth shall fear him. One day the earth shall be full of the knowledge and fear of the Lord \"as the waters cover the sea\" (Isaiah 11:11).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.68":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; let them also that hate him flee before him. Compare the chant with which the ark set forth in the wilderness, \"Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee\" (Numbers 10:35). Both utterances are expressions of confidence, that, whenever God arises, his enemies will be scattered and dispersed before him. Neither refers to any one special occasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - As smoke is driven away, so drive them away. As clouds of smoke are dispersed and driven away by the wind, and totally disappear, so let God, whenever his enemies congregate, scatter and disperse them, and reduce them to nothingness. As wax melteth before the firs, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. As smoke vanishes, so wax entirely melts away and disappears before a hot fire (comp.

Psalm 64:4): extol him that rideth upon the heavens. This passage is now generally translated, Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts (Hengstenberg, Kay, Dean Johnson, Professor Cheyne, Revised Version). The image is that of a king travelling through a waste, for whom a way was made beforehand (comp. Isaiah 40:3; Isaiah 49:11). By his name Jah; rather, Jah is his Name. \"Jah\" - the shortened form of \"Jehovah\" - occurs first in the Song of Moses (Exodus 15:2). It is repeated here in ver. 18, and recurs in Isaiah 26:4. Dr. Kay suggests that \"it represents the concentration of God's redeeming power and love.\" And rejoice before him (comp. ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God. A defender, i.e., of the oppressed and downtrodden (comp. Isaiah 1:17). In his holy habitation. The heavenly and not the earthly dwelling place - whether tabernacle or temple - seems to be intended. God from his holy seat in the highest heaven pours clown his grace and mercy, his defence and protection, on all those who specially need his aid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - God setteth the solitary in families; or, in a home; i.e. gives \"solitary ones\" - outcasts, wanderers - a home to dwell in. The reference is to the settlement of the nomadic Israelites in Canaan. He bringeth out those which are bound (see Psalm 146:7, \"The Lord looseth the prisoners;\" and compare the many references to the \"bondage\" of Israel in Egypt). The Exodus is glanced at, but not exclusively. God \"brings men out\" from the tyranny of worldly oppressors, of ghostly enemies, and of their own lusts and sins. With chains; rather, into prosperity (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). But the rebellious dwell in a dry land. Rebels against God are not \"brought out.\" They are left to dwell in the \"dry land\" of their own impenitence and self-will (comp. Numbers 14:29-35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - In the central portion of the psalm, from ver. 7 to ver. 28, God is praised for his doings in connection with the history of Israel; and, first of all, in the present passage, for his doings at Sinai and in the wilderness. Verse 7. - O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people (see Exodus 13:20-22). The present verse and the next are an echo of the Song of Deborah (Judges 5:4, 5), \"Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water; the mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel.\" When thou didst march through the wilderness. The entire march from Etham to Pisgah is in the poet's mind; but he can touch only certain features of it. And first, the scene at Sinai.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The earth shook, the heavens also dropped, at the presence of God (see Exodus 19:16-18; Deuteronomy 5:22, 23). The \"dropping\" of the heavens was the descent of a thick thundercloud upon the mount, which rested upon it, and spread around a dense and weird darkness. Even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God; literally, yonder Sinai, as if it were in sight, and could be pointed at. The God of Israel. Our God, who did all these great things for us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain. Not a literal rain, but a shower of blessings - manna, quails, water out of the rock, protection against enemies, victories, etc. Whereby thou didst confirm (or, establish) thine inheritance (see 2 Samuel 7:13). When it was weary. The wandering in the wilderness must have been inexpressibly dull and wearisome, especially to those who had left Egypt with the hope of a quick march through the waste, and a speedy entrance into \"a land flowing with milk and honey\" (Exodus 3:17). The \"establishment\" in Palestine under Joshua was a blessing that could not but be highly valued after well nigh a century of cruel bondage in Egypt, and forty years of aimless wandering in the Sinaitic peninsula.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thy congregation hath dwelt therein; thy troop, or thy host (see 2 Samuel 23:11, 13). The word used (חיּה) is an unusual one. Thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor; or, thou, O God, didst in thy goodness make preparation for the poor. \"The poor\" are the Israelites, brought low by their sufferings in Egypt and the wilderness; the preparations those by which their conquest of Palestine was facilitated (Exodus 25:28; Joshua 24:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-23. - From God's mercies to his people at Sinai and in the wilderness, the psalmist goes on to consider those connected with the conquest of Canaan, and the establishment of David's widespread rule. The passage is difficult and obscure, perhaps from its embodying fragments of the earlier Hebrew poetry. It is also full of curious transitions, and of ellipses which make the meaning doubtful. Verse 11. - The Lord gave the word. The reader naturally asks - What word? Commentators answer variously: \"the watchword\" (Cheyne); \"promise of victory\" (Kay); \"the word of command\" (Dean Johnson); \"announcement of an actual victory gained\" (Hengstenberg). I should rather understand a sort of creative word, initiating the period of strife (comp. Shakespeare's \"Cry havock, and let slip the dogs of war!\"). Great was the company of those that published it; literally, great was the company of the women that heralded it. The reference is to the female choirs which took a prominent part in the war songs of ancient days (see Exodus 15:20, 21; Judges 5:1; 1 Samuel 18:6, 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Kings of armies did flee apace; literally, did flee - did flee; i.e. fled repeatedly before Israel (see Joshua 8:19-22; Joshua 10:19, 20; Joshua 11:8, 9; Judges 3:10, 29; Judges 4:14-16; Judges 7:19-25; Judges 8:11, 12; Judges 11:29-33; Judges 15:14-16; 1 Samuel 7:10, 11; 1 Samuel 11:11; 1 Samuel 14:47, 48; 1 Samuel 15:7, 8; 1 Samuel 17:52; 2 Samuel 5:17-25; 2 Samuel 8:1, 2, 4, 5, 13; 2 Samuel 10:6-18, etc.). And she that tarried at home divided the spoil. The wives of the conquerors shared in the spoil when it was brought home (Judges 5:28-30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Though ye have lien among the pots; rather, Will ye lie down among the sheepfolds? Will ye, O ye laggarts of Israel, like the Reubenites in the war against Sisera, instead of going out to war with your brethren, \"abide among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks\" (see Judges 5:16)? Yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. It is certainly wrong to supply, yet shall ye be before as the wings of a dove.\" There can be no promise of good made to these laggarts. Probably the meaning is, \"Will ye be,\" or \"Will ye seek to be as the wings of a dove, covered with silver, and her feathers of yellow gold?\" i.e. Will ye abide in your prosperity and your riches, decked in gorgeous apparel, resplendent with silver and gold, while your brethren are bearing the brunt of battle, with all its ghastly sights and sounds, in your and the land's defence?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - When the Almighty scattered kings in it; i.e. \"in the land\" (comp. ver. 10). Most of the defeats of kings, referred to above (see the comment on ver. 12), took place within the limits of Palestine. It was white as snow in Salmon. The present text has only the two words which mean, \"it snows on Salmon;\" whence it is concluded that something must have fallen out. Professor Cheyne supplies כְּמוֵ הַשֶּׁלֶג like snow,\" and understands the passage to mean that, when the kings were scattered, \"it was like snow when it snows on Salmon\" - the ground was all covered with glistering arms, armour, and garments. Salmon was a wooded hill near Shechem (Judges 9:48).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; rather, a mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan. A sudden transition, and perhaps a quotation from an ancient poem. The special object of the psalmist's thought is not Bashan, but Mount Zion; and what he is about to celebrate is Jehovah's choice of Mount Zion for his dwelling place, and his establishment on it. But he prefers to introduce the subject by a contrast with the great range of Canaan. Bashan, he says, is truly \"a mountain of God\" - i.e. a very great mountain (see the comment on Psalm 36:6) - \"one which seemed in an especial degree to show forth creative power.\" It is also an high hill; or rather, a mountain of peaks, containing numerous pointed summits. Yet God did not choose one of these for his habitation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Why leap ye, ye high hills? rather, Why look ye askance, ye mountains of peaks? In jealousy at not being chosen. This is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; rather, on the mountain which God desireth to dwell in - a continuation of the preceding sentence. The mountain intended is, of course, Mount Zion, a comparatively low elevation. Yea, the Lord will dwell in it forever; i.e. make it his permanent, not merely his temporary, habitation, like Sinai.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels. Another abrupt transition. The psalmist sees God move from Sinai, where he had represented him as present in ver. 8, into the sanctuary of Mount Zion. He is, of course, accompanied by his angelic host. This is described as a host of chariots (comp. 2 Kings 6:17) -twenty thousand in number, and \"thousands of repetition\" - or thousands multiplied by thousands, as Hengstenberg understands the phrase (comp. Daniel 7:10). The Lord (Jehovah) is among them; or, \"in their midst.\" As in Sinai, in the holy place; rather, Sinai is in the sanctuary. The glories of Sinai are, as it were, transferred thither.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Thou hast ascended on high; i.e. ascended into the sanctuary, Mount Zion - gone up with the ark when it was transferred thither (see 2 Samuel 6:12-19; 1 Chronicles 15:11-28). Thou hast led captivity captive; i.e. thou hast made many captives - or enabled us to take many prisoners. Thou hast received gifts for men; rather, among men. Tribute from Israel's enemies is probably intended (see 2 Samuel 8:2; comp. 1 Kings 4:21). Yea, for the rebellious also; literally, yea, rebels also; i.e. enemies, that when reduced have rebelled, and then submitted to pay tribute a second time. That the Lord God (Jah Elohim) might dwell among them; \"That God, after the nations had been subdued and submitted themselves, might rest quietly thenceforth in Zion.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation.

And unto God the Lord belong the issues from death. It is through God only that, when death threatens, men escape it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - But God shall wound the head of his enemies; or, \"yet surely God will smite,\" etc. Though he gives escape from death, yet he will not do so always. On the contrary, he will assuredly smite and destroy his enemies, wounding them where a wound is fatal. And the hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses. \"The hairy scalp,\" says Dr. Kay, \"points almost certainly to Absalom.\" Others take it as merely indicating the young and strong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea. Our translators' interpolation of the words, \"my people,\" is unhappy. The psalmist means to represent God as threatening his enemies, not as encouraging his faithful ones. Though his enemies (ver. 21) fly to Bashan and bury themselves in its woods, or though they even hide themselves in the depths of the sea, he will search them out, and \"bring them back,\" that vengeance may be taken on them (see ver. 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies; i.e. \"I will bring them back for thee, my people, to dip your feet in their blood.\" The same metaphor is used in Isaiah 63:1-3; but it is God himself who, in that passage, has his feet reddened in his enemies' blood, And the tongue of thy dogs in the same. The Authorized Version has omitted one word of the original here. Translate, And that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from the same (comp. 2 Kings 9:35; Jeremiah 15:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-27. - Again we find a transition. The conquest of Canaan is complete - God is gone up into his sanctuary. The nations are led captive or put to tribute Rebels are crushed; the last remnants of them sought out, brought back, and delivered into the hands of Israel. Now we have a description of God's \"goings in the sanctuary\" (ver. 24). Some critics suppose a particular occasion to be pointed at; but the expression \"goings\" rather indicates something habitual, or, at any rate, recurring. God is from time to time glorified in his sanctuary by ceremonies which the poet describes. Verse 24. - They have seen thy goings, O God; i.e. men have seen - friends and foes alike - even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. God is at once both Israel's God and Israel's King. The monarchy has not wholly destroyed the theocracy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after (comp. 2 Samuel 6:15; 1 Chronicles 15:16-28). In Assyrian musical processions the players on instruments precede the singers ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1, p. 542). Among them were the damsels playing with timbrels; rather, in the midst of the damsels, etc. The damsels are represented, not as intermixed with the (male) singers and players on instruments, but as encircling them. (On the use of \"timbrels\" (tambourines) by Israelite maidens, see Exodus 15:20; Judges 11:34.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. This is probably the refrain of the hymn sung (comp. Exodus 15:21; 2 Chronicles 5:13; Ezra 3:11). By \"the fountain of Israel\" is no doubt meant the sanctuary on Mount Zion - \"the ever-living fountain of praise\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - There is little Benjamin with their ruler. \"With\" is wrongly supplied by our translators. \"Little Benjamin\" the \"smallest of the tribes of Israel\" (1 Samuel 9:21) - is called \"their ruler,\" as having furnished the first king, and the one who began the conquests celebrated in vers. 11-23. If the psalm is to be accounted as David's, we may note it as a graceful act on his part that he places Saul's tribe first. The princes of Judah and their council. Again \"and\" is wrongly supplied. \"The princes of Judah\" are called \"their council,\" or \"their bulwark\" (Kay), as holding the most important position in Israel at the time. The reading, however, is doubtful. The princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. Four tribes only are mentioned, not because no more than four took part in the processions, but as representatives of the whole number. The tribes selected for mention are from the two ends of the land - the extreme south and the extreme north. Zebulun and Naphtali were the most important of the northern tribes (see Judges 4:6, 10; Judges 5:18), as Judah and Benjamin were of the southern ones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-35. - The psalmist now turns to the future. First, he prays that God will complete the work which he has begun by continually strengthening Israel (ver. 28). Then he rises to prophecy. Kings and princes shall bring presents to Zion; empires shall prostrate themselves; Egypt and Ethiopia shall hasten to bow down; all the kingdoms of the earth shall ultimately \"sing praises unto the Lord.\" Israel and the God of Israel will thus be glorified exceedingly. Verse 28. - Thy God hath commanded (or, ordained) thy strength. It is fixed in the Divine counsels that Israel shall be strong. This was determined long ago, and is in course of accomplishment. But more is needed. The psalmist therefore prays, Strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. Complete thy work; \"strengthen the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees;\" weaken also and bring down our enemies (ver. 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. So Ewald, Kay, and the Revised Version, though critics generally doubt whether min can have this meaning. If min has its usual sense of \"from,\" we must regard the kings as having entered the temple courts, and from thence stretching out their hands, and offering their gifts, to God, who is in the holy of holies.

The multitude of the bulls represents other heathen powers, Assyria perhaps especially, which had the human-headed and winged bull for its principal emblem. With the calves of the people; rather, of peoples - an obscure phrase, perhaps meaning inferior powers. Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver; literally, (each) submitting himself to thee with pieces of silver. This is given as the result of the rebukes. When the various earth powers have been \"rebuked\" or chastised by God, then they will submit to bring gifts, or pay tribute, to Israel (comp. ver. 18). Scatter thou the people that delight in war. This is exegetical of the first clause - rebuke these various world powers that delight in war by \"scattering\" them, or putting them to flight before their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPrinces shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Princes shall come out of Egypt. Then shall princely ambassadors come to Zion out of Egypt, and make submission (comp. Isaiah 43:3; Isaiah 45:14). Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. The Ptolemies, in their wars with Syria, often sought the favour of the Jews. Christian Churches at an early date were established both in Egypt and in Abyssinia, and some of the most promising mission fields today are in Africa.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord.

Which were of old. In which God dwelt from all eternity - long before he created the \"heavens\" of Genesis 1:1. Lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

And his strength is in the clouds. Not in earth only, but in heaven also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm68:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.

(On the \"terribleness\" of God, see Deuteronomy 7:21; Deuteronomy 10:17; Job 37:22; Psalm 47:2; Psalm 66:3, 5; Jeremiah 20:11; Zephaniah 2:11; Nehemiah 1:5; Nehemiah 4:14; 6:32; Hebrews 12:29.)

Verse 1. - Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. This is a common, perhaps, we may say, a proverbial, expression for any great distress (comp. Psalm 18:4; Psalm 42:7; Psalm 88:7, 17; and Job 22:11; Job 27:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing. \"Mire\" and \"clay\" are metaphors for dangers and difficulties, which entangle a man and incapacitate him from exertion (comp. Psalm 40:2). I am come into deep waters (comp. ver. 15; and see also Psalm 124:4, 5; Psalm 130:1). Where the floods overflow me; i.e. \"I am utterly overwhelmed by my misfortunes.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I am weary of my crying; i.e. \"I have cried to God for aid, until I am weary of so doing.\" No reply comes, no aid is given. My throat is dried. Parched - unable to cry out any more. Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God (comp. Psalm 119:82; Deuteronomy 28:32). \"I have waited and looked for God, till I can look no more.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head (comp. Psalm 35:14; and for the simile. comp. Psalm 40:12; both of them Davidical compositions). They that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty. Joab and Abiathar, who supported the rebellion of Adonijah (1 Kings 1:7), and were \"mighty\" men, certainly were David's enemies \"wrongfully.\" And the same may be said of Absalom and Ahithophel. Then I restored that which I took not away. Dr. Kay supposes David's quasi-abdication of a crown which he had not placed on his own head (2 Samuel 15:14-17) to be alluded to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-12. - David follows up his complaint by a confession of sin (ver. 5), which shows that his sufferings are, at any rate, in some measure, deserved; but, at the same time, he pleads that, as his enemies are really persecuting him for his righteous deeds and his adherence to God (vers. 74 11), God is bound to come to his aid, in order that his own honour may be vindicated, and that the godly may not be put to shame on his (David's) account. Verse 5. - O God, thou knowest my foolishness (see Psalm 38:5). According to the teaching both of the Old Testament (Proverbs, passim) and of the New (Mark 7:22; Romans 1:21, 22; Galatians 3:1, etc.), folly is a form of sin. And my sins are not hid from thee. The rebuke of Nathan and the death of his child (2 Samuel 12:7-19) had fully convinced David of this. Thenceforward his sins were ever before him (Psalm 51:3), continually confessed by him, and felt to be as well known to God as to himself. Compare the opening of Psalm 139:, \"Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether\" (vers. 1-4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Let not them that wait on thee (or, hope in thee), O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake; or, through me (Revised Version); on my account (Kay) - as they would be if I, although thy faithful worshipper, were delivered into my enemies' hands. Let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. One of the many places where the second clause is a simple echo of the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Because for thy sake I have borne reproach. The real secret of the enmity which David provoked, both on the part of Saul, of Absalom, of Joab, and of other ungodly men, was his own piety and devotion to God's service. Irreligious men hate those who are religions, whose conduct shames them by its contrast with their own evil courses. They revenge themselves, sometimes by scoffing at the religious observances of the pious (ver. 10), sometimes by insinuating that all profession of religion is hypocrisy. Shame hath covered my face. I have been made to feel shame at the charges which have been brought against me (see 2 Samuel 15:3; 2 Samuel 16:7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. The preference of David over all his elder brethren was calculated to arouse their jealousy (1 Samuel 16:6-13); and Eliab's hostile feeling is distinctly shown in 1 Samuel 17:28. We may gather from Psalm 38:, as well as from the present passage, that the alienation continued, and was not confined to Eliab.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. David's \"zeal for God's house\" was shown, first, in his establishment of the tabernacle on Mount Zion (2 Samuel 6:12-19); next, in his earnest desire to build a permanent and magnificent dwelling for the ark of the covenant (2 Samuel 7:2; Psalm 132:2-5); then, in his careful collection of materials for the building which he was forbidden to erect himself (1 Chronicles 28:11-18; 1 Chronicles 29:2-5); and finally, in the directions that he left to Solomon with respect to it (1 Chronicles 28:9, 10, 20). It was also shown, if we take \"house\" in a wider sense, by his careful government of the land and people, the kingdom and household of God, for forty years. And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. David may either mean that every reproach uttered against God was as keenly felt by him as if it had been directed against himself, or that, when men reproached him, they really meant to reproach God (i.e. religion) in him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. David's practice of fasting appears both here and also in Psalm 35:13; Psalm 109:24; 2 Kings 12:16, 22. As fasting was not enjoined by the Law, he might be reproached for over-righteousness, and perhaps also for ostentation, on account of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I made sackcloth also my garment (see Psalm 30:12; Psalm 35:13); and I became a proverb to them; or, a byword, as the same word, mashal, is rendered in Psalm 44:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They that sit in the gate speak against me; rather, talk about me (Revised Version) - make me their theme (Cheyne). The gates, where the chief business was done, were no doubt also places of gossip. And I was the song of the drunkards (comp. Job 30:9); literally, of the drinkers of strong drink.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-21. - The psalmist now betakes himself to earnest prayer - he has sufficiently represented his condition, though he still adds a few words respecting it (vers. 19-21), and the immediate need is relief. He therefore approaches God in what he hopes is \"an acceptable time\" (ver. 13), and humbly entreats for mercy (vers. 14-18). Verse 13. - But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time (comp. Psalm 32:6; Isaiah 49:8). Professor Cheyne asks, \"How has it been revealed to the psalmist that this is an acceptable time?\" We can only answer - Perhaps it has not been revealed; he may express a hope rather than a full assurance. Or it may have been revealed to him in the way that other things were. O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me; or, \"in the greatness of thy mercy;\" i.e. as thy mercy is so great. In the truth of thy salvation. \"In the exercise of that fidelity which secures the salvation of all that trust it\" (Professor Alexander).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink (comp. ver. 2, with the comment). Let me be delivered from them that hate me (see ver. 4). And out of the deep waters (comp. vers. 1, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Let not the waterflood overflew me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. The reference is still to vers. 1, 2; and the prayer is for deliverance from the dangers and entanglements there spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Hear me, O Lord, for thy loving kindness is good (comp. ver. 13). Turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. The psalmist implies that God's face had been for some time turned away from him, and begs to be restored to favour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And hide not thy face from thy servant (comp. Psalm 10:1; Psalm 13:1; Psalm 22:24; Psalm 27:9, etc.). For I am in trouble; literally, for there is trouble to me. On the probable nature of the \"trouble,\" see the introductory paragraph. Hear me speedily (comp. Psalm 22:19; Psalm 31:2; Psalm 38:22; Psalm 70:1, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDraw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it. David often complains that God is far from him (Psalm 10:1; Psalm 22:19; Psalm 38:21; Psalm 71:12, etc.), and prays that he will \"draw nigh,\" the sense of distance and alienation being intolerable. Deliver me because of mine enemies; i.e. because of their plots and machinations (see ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour (comp. vers. 7-12). Whatever David has suffered at the hands of his enemies has been fully known to God, who has at any rate permitted it. Having seen and known, God will not forget. My adversaries are all before thee. Thou hast seen my adversaries also, and still hast them in thy sight. Thou beholdest their insolence and audacity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Reproach hath broken my heart. (comp. vers. 7, 9, 19). Some of his enemies' reproaches were, no doubt, based on David's old misdoings. These, which he could not rebut, would cause him the severest pain. And I am full of heaviness; or, \"full of sickness;\" \"very sick\" (Kay); \"sick to death\" (Delitzsch). And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. It is questioned whether David was ever without friends to pity and comfort him, and suggested that at this point he passes from narrative to prophecy, and describes, not his own condition, but that of the Messiah, whom he typified, speaking as he was moved by the Holy Ghost. Jesus was certainly left without pity or comfort, when \"all the disciples forsook him, and fled\" (Matthew 26:56).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They gave me also gall for my meat. Here, at any rate, the psalmist is inspired to be Messianic, i.e. to use words which, while they can only be applied to himself metaphorically and loosely, are in the strictest and most literal sense applicable to Christ. Gall was actually mingled with the drink which was given to Christ just before he was crucified, and which he tasted, but would not swallow (Matthew 27:34). And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. Similarly, when upon the cress Christ uttered the words, \"I thirst,\" those who stood by \"filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his month. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost\" (John 19:29, 30); comp. Psalm 22:16-18, where little facts, not true of David, but true of Christ, are recorded of an afflicted one, who partly represents David, partly his great Descendant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-29. - The imagination of the cruelties to be inflicted on his innocent Descendant works up the psalmist to a pitch of passionate resentment, which finds vent in a series of bitter imprecations, very distasteful to many. They are less startling, however, than some to be found elsewhere, as in Psalm 102. We may view them either as an outpouring of righteous indignation upon the enemies, not of David only, but of God; or as a series of prophetic denunciations, whereby the wicked of David's time were warned of the consequences of such wickedness as theirs, and stimulated to repentance. Verse 22. - Let their table become a snare before them. It is not very clear how their table was to ensnare them: perhaps by encouraging them to gluttony and sensuousness, and bringing upon them the diseases which those sins breed; perhaps by leading them to an ostentatious display of wealth and luxury (comp. Ezekiel 23:40, 41). And that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap. Let them be trapped by the good things of their table, like a wild beast by a bait.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not. This may be taken either literally, \"let blindness come upon those who have so misused their eyes;\" or metaphorically, \"let their understandings, which they have partially blinded, be wholly darkened.\" And make their loins continually to shake. Deprive them of the strength whereof they have boasted, and which they have misapplied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. At any rate, be angry with them, and show thine anger in some way or other. Let them net escape scatheless. A general malediction, after which the writer returns to particulars.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Let their habitation be desolate; literally, their encampment Tirah (טִירָה) is the circular enclosure of a nomadic tribe, within which it kept its cattle or took refuge itself (Genesis 26:16; Numbers 31:10). Nomadic expressions remained in use after nomadic habits had ceased (see 1 Kings 12:16). And let none dwell in their tents. A duplication of the preceding clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten. This would apply equally to David, and his great Antitype. It is an aggravation of cruelty when men persecute one who is already suffering affliction at God's hand. And they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded; rather, they talk of the grief of those, etc. They speak of it mockingly, or, at any rate, unsympathetically.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAdd iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Add iniquity unto their iniquity. Either \"let them fall from one wickedness to another,\" as the clause is rendered in the Prayer book Version; or \"add to the record of their sin in thy book, a further record of other sins, as they commit them.\" And let them not come into thy righteousness; i.e. let them not receive the gift of thy justifying grace, and so be counted among thy righteous ones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Let them be blotted out of the Book of the living. God is supposed to have a \"book of the living\" in his possession, which contains the names of all those on whom he looks with favour, and whom he will bless both in this world and beyond the grave (comp. Exodus 32:32; Psalm 86:6; Ezekiel 13:9; Daniel 12:1). From this list, as from any register of earthly citizenship, the names of the unworthy may be erased. David prays for the erasure of the names of those unworthy ones against whom his imprecations are uttered. And not be written with the righteous; i.e. not remain written in the book side by side with the names of the righteous. The New Testament, no less than the Old, tells of this book (see Luke 10:20; Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5; Revelation 13:8; Revelation 20:12; Revelation 21:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - But I am poor and sorrowful; let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. The psalmist adds to his list of imprecations, by way of contrast, an invocation of blessing on himself. As his present condition is iu strong contrast with that of his ungodly enemies, as be is \"poor and sorrowful,\" while they are prosperous and self-satisfied, so let their future conditions be. While they are depressed and disgraced, let him be \"set up on high.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-36. - In conclusion, the psalmist bursts out into praise. Confident of receiving the deliverance for which he has prayed, he anticipates it by at once offering thanksgiving (ver. 30). He then calls on others to rejoice with him, first on the poor and humble (vers. 32, 33), then on heaven and earth and their inhabitants generally (ver. 34). Finally, he delivers a confident prophecy of the continued prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem (vers. 35, 36). Verse 30. - I will praise the Name of God with a song. (For praise of the Name of God, see Psalm 7:17; Psalm 9:2; Psalm 29:2; Psalm 34:3; Psalm 66:1; Psalm 68:4, etc.) And will magnify him with thanksgiving. Thanksgiving had already, in Psalm 50:13, 14, been set above sacrifice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs; i.e. that is fit for legal sacrifice - of full age, and clean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The humble shall see this, and be glad. The meek - God's people - see David's deliverance, and are glad - rejoice in their heart, and unite with him in thanksgiving. And your heart shall live that seek God (comp. Psalm 22:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - For the Lord heareth the poor. The \"poor in spirit\" are probably meant (comp. ver. 29). And despiseth not his prisoners. Those who suffer for his sake.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moveth therein (comp. Psalm 96:11). As Job calls on heaven and earth to sympathize with him in his distress (Job 16:18, 19), so David would have them to partake in his joy at his deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - For God will save Zion. It is not necessary to suppose that Jerusalem was in any immediate danger. The psalmist merely means that the same God from whom he now confidently expects deliverance will always watch over his city, over his people, over his inheritance, and whenever danger threatens, will exert his protecting power and save. Prophecies of this kind are always conditional, and thus Zion, when she rejected God for idols (2 Chronicles 36:14), and again when she rejected him for Barabbas (Matthew 27:21), forfeited the promised blessing of continuance, and brought about her own destruction. And will build the cities of Judah; i.e. maintain them, keep them from decay and ruin. That they may dwell there; i.e. continue to inhabit the cities. And have it (i.e. Zion, or Jerusalem) in possession.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm69:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The seed also of his servants shall inherit it. Nor shall the city alone - the mere walls and buildings - continue to exist. \"The seed of God's servants\" - his people Israel - shall continue to inhabit it. And they that love his Name shall dwell therein. When the earthly Zion fell away and forfeited the promises, they passed to the heavenly Zion (Hebrews 12:22) - the Church of God, the true Israel.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger. The psalmist begins by deprecating God's wrath and displeasure. He is conscious of some grievous sin, deserving rebuke and chastisement, and he does not ask to be spared his chastisement; but he would fain be chastised in love, not in anger (comp. Jeremiah 10:24, \"O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing\"). Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure; or, in thy wrath. In its primary sense, humah (חמה) is no doubt \"heat,\" \"glow; ' but the secondary sense of \"anger,\" \"wrath,\" is quite as common.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak; rather, I am faint, or languid - withered away, like a faded plant or flower. O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed. Bodily ailment seems certainly to be implied; but it is that sort of bodily ailment which is often produced by mental distress - a general languor, weariness, and distaste for exertion (comp. Psalm 22:14; Psalm 31:10; Psalm 38:3; Psalm 102:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - My soul is also sore vexed. It is not, however, the body alone which suffers; the soul also is vexed, and vexed greatly (מְאֹד). Clearly the main emphasis is intended to be laid on the mental suffering. But thou, O Lord, how long! We may fill up the ellipse in various ways: \"How long wilt thou look on?\" \"How long wilt thou hide thyself?\" \"How long wilt thou be angry?\" (see Psalm 34:17; Psalm 79:5; Psalm 89:46). Or again, \"How long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear?\" (Habakkuk 1:2). The cry is that of one wearied out with long suffering (comp. Psalm 90:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReturn, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Return, O Lord. God seemed to have withdrawn himself, to have, forsaken the mourner, and gone far away (comp. Psalm 22:1). Hence the cry, \"Return\" (comp. Psalm 80:14; Psalm 90:13). Nothing is so hard to endure as the feeling of being deserted by God. Deliver my soul. \"The psalmist feels himself so wretched in soul and body, that he believes himself to be near death\" (Hengstenberg). His prayer here is, primarily, for deliverance from this impending danger, as appears clearly from the following verse, Save me for thy mercys' sake. Either a repetition of the preceding prayer in other words, or an enlargement of it so as to include salvation of every kind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For in death there is no remembrance of thee (comp. Psalm 30:9; Psalm 88:11; Psalm 115:17; Psalm 118:17; Isaiah 38:18). The general view of the psalmists seems to have been that death was a cessation of the active service of God - whether for a time or permanently, they do not make clear to us. So even Hezekiah, in the passage of Isaiah above quoted. Death is represented as a sleep (Psalm 13:3), but whether there is an awakening from it does not appear. No doubt, as has been said ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 182), \"the cessation of active service, even of remembrance or devotion, does not affect the question of a future restoration,\" and the metaphor of sleep certainly suggests the idea of an awakening. But such a veil hung over the other world, under the old dispensation, and over the condition of the departed in it, that thought was scarcely exercised upon the subject. Men's duties in this life were what occupied them, and they did not realize that in another they would have employments - much less form any notion of what those employments would be. The grave seemed a place of silence, inaction, tranquillity. In the grave (Hebrew, in Sheol) who shall give thee thanks? (comp. Psalm 115:17, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I am weary - or, worn out (Kay) - with my groaning. The Oriental habit of giving vent to grief in loud lamentations must be remembered. Herodotus says that at the funeral of Masistias, the Persians present \"vented their grief in such loud cries that all Boeotia resounded with the clement\" (Herod., 9:24). All the night make I my bed to swim (comp. Homer, 'Od.,' 17:102, 103). The Revised Version has, \"every night,\" which is a possible meaning. Dr. Kay translates, \"I drench my bed.\" I water my couch with my tears. One of the usual pleonastic second clauses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Mine eye is consumed because of grief; or, mine eye is wasted away because of provocation. The eye falls in, becomes dull, and, as it were, \"wastes away\" through long-continued grief (comp. Psalm 31:9). The kind of grief expressed by the word ka'as (כַעַס) is \"that which arises from provocation or spiteful treatment\" (Kay). It waxeth old because of all mine enemies. It becomes dull and heavy and sunken, like the eye of an old man. How often has it not been noted that nothing so much ages a man as grief!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDepart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity! Note the sudden change of tone, very characteristic of the Davidical psalms. The psalmist, having offered his prayer, is so certain of its acceptance that he at once turns upon his adversaries with words of reproach, and almost of menace. \"Depart from me!\" he exclaims; \"get ye gone! do not dare any more to persecute me or plot against me! Your efforts are in vain.\" For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. David speaks from an inward conviction. He knows that he has prayed sincerely and fervently. He is certain, therefore, that his prayer is heard and accepted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive - rather, hath received; προσεδέξατο (LXX.) - my prayer. The threefold repetition marks the absoluteness of the psalmist's conviction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed; rather, all mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore vexed (Rosenmuller, Kay, and others). Shame will fall upon David's enemies when their plots have failed, and deep vexation when they find him restored to health (ver. 4) and in the full enjoyment of the Divine favour. Lot them return; rather, they shall return; i.e. \"retire... turn their backs,\" \"take to flight.\" As Hengstenberg says, \"David sees his enemies, who are gathered around him for the attack, all at once in alarm give way.\" And be ashamed suddenly. It is doubly shameful to have to fly when one has been the assailant.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.70":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm70:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Make haste, O God, to deliver me. In Psalm 40:13 we find, \"Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me;\" and this would seem to be the right way of supplying the ellipse here. Make haste to help me, O Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm70:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Let them be ashamed and confounded. Psalm 40:14 adds, \"together.\" That seek after my soul. Psalm 40 adds, \"to destroy it.\" Let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. Identical with Psalm 40:14, and translated more literally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm70:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame.

Psalm 40:15 has, \"that say to me, Aha, aha!\" which is better.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm70:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

Instead of this last clause, Psalm 40:17 has, \"Yet the Lord thinketh upon me,\" which cannot be ascribed to a corruption, but must be an alteration made deliberately. Thou art my Help and my Deliverer; O Lord, make no tarrying. Identical with Psalm 40:17, except that here once more \"Jehovah\" replaces \"Elohim.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.71":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust let me never be put to confusion; rather, as in Psalm 31:1, \"let me never Be ashamed;\" or, let me never be put to shame (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Deliver me in thy righteousness. Identical with the last clause of Psalm 31:1. And cause me to escape. The danger seems to be pressing, and such as characterized Absalom's rather than Adonijah's rebellion. Incline thine ear unto me, and save me (comp. Psalm 31:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Be thou my strong Habitation; literally, be thou to me for a Rock of habitation; i.e. a rock upon which I may take up my abode. Whereunto I may continually resort. Exegetical of the preceding clause, habitation\" Thou hast given \"a rock of commandment to save me. It is in thy counsels that I am to be helped and saved - not left to the will of my enemies (comp. Psalm 68:28). This conviction lies at the root of the psalmist's faith and trust. For thou art my Rock and my Fortress (comp. Psalm 18:2; Psalm 61:2, 3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand (rather, grasp) of the unrighteous and cruel man. it is characteristic of David to single out from his adversaries an individual man, from whom he especially asks to be delivered (comp. Psalm 13:2; Psalm 17:13; Psalm 18:17, 48; Psalm 35:8; Psalm 41:6, 9, 11; Psalm 55:13, 14, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For thou art my Hope, O Lord God (comp.

Psalm 22:9, 10, of which this is plainly an echo or reminiscence). My praise shall be continually of thee (see vers. 14-16, 22-24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - I am as a wonder unto many; or, as a portent, a prodigy - something montrous. Some explain, \"as an object of God's singular favour from his youth\" (Kay, Cheyne); others, \"as a marvellous example of God's punishments\" (Schultens, Hengstenberg, Professor Alexander, Canon Cook). The latter explanation is supported by Deuteronomy 28:46, and, on the whole, seems preferable. But thou art my strong Refuge (see above, ver. 3, ad fin.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day. Praise alternates with complaint and prayer, even in this first portion of the psalm, preparing the way for the sustained praise of the second portion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Cast me not off in the lime of old age. This expression, combined with the allusion to old age and grey hairs in ver. 18, indicates that the writer was drawing near to the natural term of human life, and already felt the infirmities of old age creeping upon him. This note of date suits better the time of Adonijah's rebellion than that of Absalom's. Forsake me not when my strength faileth. An appeal to the Divine compassion. If God was his \"Rock and Fortress\" (ver. 3), his \"strong Refuge\" (ver. 7), when he was in his full vigour, much more will he support and befriend him when be is weak and helpless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For mine enemies speak against me. The psalmist's weakness encourages his enemies to make their attacks. They begin by speaking against him - calumniating him (2 Samuel 15:3, 4), and shortly they will proceed to acts. And they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together; or, \"they that watch for my soul\" (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him. Compare the words of Ahithophel, \"Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue alter David this night; and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed; and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only\" (2 Samuel 17:1, 2). It no doubt appeared to Absalom's party generally, as it did to Shimei, that God had \"forsakes\" David, and turned against him (2 Samuel 16:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help (comp.

He will spend the whole day in telling of God's righteousness and salvation (ver. 15). The mighty acts of the Lord shall form his theme, together with the righteousness of God, and of none other (ver. 16). As God has enabled him to declare his praise in the past (ver. 17), so he trusts to be still upheld and enabled to proclaim the same to the new generation (ver. 18). God's righteousness is \"very high,\" and there is none like him (ver. 19). When he. brings men into trouble, it is only to \"turn again and comfort them\" (vers. 20, 21). In conclusion, the writer promises that his hymns of praise shall not only be said, but sung, and accompanied with the melody of music (ver. 22). His lips and soul shall both rejoice together (ver. 23); and the praise of God shall employ his tongue without ceasing (ver. 24). Verse 14. - But I will hope continually; literally, but as for me, I will hope, etc. The phrase, \"as for me,\" almost always marks a transition. And will yet praise thee more and more; literally, I will add to all thy praise; i.e. \"I will add to all my past praises of thee further praises in the future.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day. Salvation is inseparable from righteousness. It is as being righteous himself that God accepts the righteous, and as faithful to his promises, which is a part of his righteousness, that he pardons penitents. For I know not the numbers thereof (comp. Psalm 40:5). God's acts of pardoning mercy, by which he brings about the salvation of penitents, are innumerable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will go in the strength of the Lord God; literally, I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord God (Revised Version); i.e. I will bring these acts forward, and make mention of them in my songs of praise. I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only. I will attribute my deliverance to no strength, or efforts, or righteousness of my own (see Psalm 20:7; Psalm 44:3, 6), but to thy righteousness - i.e. thy faithfulness and truth - only.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. Hitherto, i.e., have I always had thy guidance and instruction, and hitherto have I always had occasion to praise thy Name. Hence I am confident with respect to the future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Now also when! am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not. Surely, then, thou wilt not forsake me when my youth has fled, and my time of weakness and decay has arrived, so that I need thee all the more. At the time of Adonijah's rebellion, David was \"old and stricken in years\" (1 Kings 1:1) - nearly, if not quite, seventy years of age (2 Samuel 5:4). Until I have showed thy strength (literally, thine own) unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come. The psalmist calls on God to sustain him in his old age, not for his own sake, but that he may impress on the rising generation God's might and marvellous acts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high; or, reaches to the height (comp.

The change of number may be ascribed to the desire of the psalmist to unite his people with himself in the hopes of deliverance which he is expressing. And shalt bring me up again (rather, shalt bring us up again) from the depths of the earth. 'The \"depths of the earth\" is a metaphor for the extreme of misery and depression (comp. Psalm 88:6; Psalm 130:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side. The psalmist feels that the trial now laid upon him is the last - that henceforth his greatness and majesty will increase instead of diminishing, and that God will turn and comfort him (comp. 1 Chronicles 29:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. (On the psaltery, and its use as a devotional instrument, see the comment on Psalm 33:2.) The conjunction of the psaltery and harp seems to imply that the \"praise,\" of which the writer here speaks, is to be public praise in the sanctuary, accompanied by the usual sacred music.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm71:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.

God had established in Israel, in the person of David, hereditary monarchy (2 Samuel 7:12-16), such as was usual in the East, and suited to Oriental notions. In speaking of himself, not only as \"the king,\" but also as \"the king's son,\" Solomon makes appeal to the sentiment of respect for hereditary royalty. Compare the inscription of Mesha, \"My father was king over Moab thirty years, and I became king after my father\" (line 1).

It does not appear that any particular seas are meant, as in Exodus 23:31 and Numbers 34:3, 6; rather, the idea is that the earth is set in the midst of the sea, and that Messiah's dominion will reach from shore to shore. And from the river (i.e. the Euphrates) unto the ends of the earth. Israel's promised dominion extended only as far as the great river (Genesis 15:18), which was also the boundary of Solomon's kingdom eastward (1 Kings 4:21, 24); Messiah's was to reach indefinitely beyond the river to the world's end.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They that dwell in the wilderness shall how before him (for the meaning here assigned to tsiyyim (ציּים), see Psalm 74:14; Isaiah 23:13). The wild tribes of the Syrian and Arabian deserts are probably intended (comp. Isaiah 60:6, 7).

According to Herodotus, Tartessus, when it first became known to the Greeks, was governed by kings (Herod., 1:163). By \"the isles\" are to be understood the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean generally. All these have, at one time or another, paid homage to Christ. The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. \"Sheba\" and \"Seba\" are distinguished by the writer of Genesis (Genesis 10:7), and appear not even to have been very near the one to the other. Sheba was in Southeastern Arabia, and was known to the Greeks and Romans as the country of the Sabaeans (Diod. Sic., 3:45; Strabo, 16:4, § 19; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 6:23). Saba was in Africa, on the Middle Nile, and the Sebaeans (סְבָאִים) are closely connected by Isaiah with Ethiopia and Egypt (Isaiah 43:3; Isaiah 45:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him (comp.

General truths are often expressed by the sacred writers universally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper (comp. ver. 4); rather, and the poor who has no helper. Two classes of persons are spoken of, not three (comp. Job 29:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He shall spare the poor and needy; or, the weak and needy.

Messiah's especial tenderness towards the poor and lowly is a main feature in all descriptions of his kingdom (see Isaiah 11:4; Isaiah 29:19; Isaiah 41:17, etc.), and was emphasized by our Lord when he came upon earth (Matthew 11:5; Luke 4:18). And precious shall their blood be in his sight. Worth, therefore, a mighty ransom (comp. Psalm 116:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba. He (i.e. Messiah) \"shall live\" - shall live on, and reign on, in his everlasting kingdom; and men shall bring to him of the gold of Sheba (1 Kings 10:10; Ezekiel 27:22), giving him of their best and rarest, in grateful acknowledgment of his goodness and protection. Prayer also shall be made for him continually. His subjects shall offer prayer for him continually, as Christians do when they pray, \"Thy kingdom come\" (Hengstenberg). And daily shall he be praised; rather, all day long shall they praise him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - There shall be an handful of corn in the earth; rather, as in the Prayer book Version, an heap of corn; or, abundance of corn (Revised Version), \"Abundance of corn\" is put for general prosperity. Upon the top of the mountains. In flourishing times of agriculture, the very tops of the mountains were cultivated all over Palestine, as appears by the remains of terraces. The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon. Canon Cook's seems to be the best exposition: \"The ripened corn on the heights shall rustle in the wind like the foliage on Lebanon.\" And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. \"They of the city\" are the inhabitants of the \"New Jerusalem\" (Revelation 21:2), the citizens of Messiah's kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - His Name shall endure forever (comp. Psalm 45:2, 6; Psalm 102:12; Isaiah 9:7). \"The eternity of the Name is based upon the eternity of the kingdom\" (Hengstenberg). His Name shall be continued as long as the sun (comp. ver. 5); or, his Name shall be renewed - shall spring again to fresh life. Dr. Kay compares an expression of Renan's, \"Son culte se rajeunira.\" And men shall be blessed in him; literally, men shall bless themselves in him (comp. Genesis 22:18; Genesis 26:4). All nations shall call him blessed. With these words the psalm, properly speaking, ends. The doxology (vers. 18, 19) and the note (ver. 20) were probably appended by the arranger of the book.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel (compare the other doxologies, which begin similarly (Psalm 41:13; Psalm 89:52; Psalm 106:42). Who only doeth wondrous things (comp. Psalm 86:8, 10; and Job 5:9). And blessed be his glorious Name forever (comp. Psalm 29:2; Psalm 34:3; Psalm 46:2; Psalm 69:30; Psalm 113:2, etc.). And let the whole earth be filled with his glory. The whole earth can no otherwise be filled with the glory of God, than by men everywhere glorifying him, and bowing clown in adoration before his Son. The promise had been made that so it should one day be (Numbers 14:21); and the psalmist anticipates the fulfilment of the promise. Amen, and Amen (comp. Psalm 41:13; Psalm 89:52; Psalm 106:48).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm72:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. This is a note appended, either by the collector of the first two Books of the Psalms, or by the collector of the Third Book, who thus marked the difference between the previous collection and his own, the former containing sixty psalms ascribed to David in their titles, and the latter one only (Psalm 86).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.73":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Truly God is good to Israel; i.e. verily, in spite of appearances to the contrary, which had for a time made the writer doubt. It is suggested that the triumph of Absalom may have been the circumstance that shook Asaph's faith. Even to such as are of a clean heart; i.e. to the pious in Israel, who are the true Israel. God is really on their side, though he may seem for a time to favour the wicked. (On the need of a pure heart, see Psalm 24:4.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped. The psalmist had doubted God's goodness and righteousness, on account of the prosperity of the wicked. He feels now that his doubt had been a sin, and had almost caused him to give up his confidence and trust in the Almighty. He had well nigh slipped from the rock of faith into the abyss of scepticism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked (comp. Psalm 37:1). To envy the wicked because they prosper is to make more account of the good things of this life than of God's favour - to prefer physical good to moral. It is also to doubt that God governs the universe by the strict rule of justice. The word translated \"foolish\" means rather, \"vain arrogant boasters.\" Such the wicked commonly become when they prosper (comp. Psalm 5:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For there are no bands in their death; or, no sufferings (δυσπάθειαι, Aquila; \"torments,\" Cheyne); comp. Job 21:13, \"They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave;\" and ver. 23, \"One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.\" Such deaths often happen, and are a severe trial of faith to those who have no firm conviction of the reality of a hereafter. But their strength is firm; literally, their body is plump (Cheyne). But the Authorized Version probably gives the true meaning. They drop into the grave while their strength is still undiminished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men (comp. Job 21:8-10). There is, no doubt, something of Oriental hyperbole in this representation, as there is in the account given by Job (l.s.c.), which he afterwards qualifies (Job 27:13-23). But still a certain immunity from suffering does seem often to attach to the wicked man, whom God does not chasten, because chastening would be of no service to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; or, is as a chain about their neck (Revised Version) - makes them stiffen their neck, and hold their head aloft. Not being afflicted, they regard themselves as favourites of Heaven, and are therefore puffed up with pride, which they show in their gait and bearing. Violence covereth them as a garment. Pride and self-conceit naturally lead on to violence, which becomes so habitual to them that it seems like their ordinary apparel (comp. Psalm 109:18, 19). The violence of the great ones in Israel is continually denounced, both by psalmists and prophets (see Psalm 11:2; Psalm 55:9; Psalm 58:2; Psalm 72:14, etc.; Isaiah 1:15; Isaiah 3:15; Isaiah 59:3-7; Hosea 4:1, 2; Amos 3:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Their eyes stand out with fatness. Their eyes, which gloat upon the luxuries around them, seem to stand out from their fat and bloated faces (comp. Job 15:27; Psalm 17:10). They have more than heart could wish; literally, the imaginations of their heart overflew. The exact meaning is doubtful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily; rather, they scoff, and speak wickedly; of oppression do they speak from heaven's height; i.e. \"they scoff at the righteous, and speak wickedly concerning them; they talk of the oppressive acts which they meditate, as though they were Divine beings, speaking from the heavenly height\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - They set their mouth against the heavens. So Hupfeld and Canon Cook, who understand the expression of blasphemy; but most modern critics translate, \"They have set their mouth in the heavens,\" and regard the meaning as nearly allied to that of the second clause of the preceding verse, \"They speak as though they were inhabitants of the heavens.\" And their tongue walketh through the earth. Their tongue is always busily employed - boasting (ver. 3), lying, backbiting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Therefore his people return hither; rather, therefore he turns his people hitherward; i.e. by his great pretensions and his audacity, he (the wicked man) turns his followers to his own courses, and induces them to act as he acts. And waters of a full cup are wrung out to them; rather, and waters in abundance are drained by them. They \"drink iniquity like water\" (Job 15:16), \"draining\" the cup which is handed to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And they say, How doth God know? Their wickedness breeds scepticism in them. They wish God not to know, and therefore begin to question whether he does or can know (comp. Psalm 10:4, 11, 13). And is there knowledge in the Most High? Does God concern himself at all with the things that take place on earth (comp. Psalm 94:7)? IS not man too weak and contemptible to attract his attention?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; rather, and they prosper always. They increase in riches. This is the impression which the psalmist has received from the general course of human affairs in his day. It is closely allied to the view taken by Job (Job 21:7-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVerily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. Such was the psalmist's first instinctive feeling, when he noticed the prosperity of the wicked. The Prayer book Version inserts, between this verse and the last, the words, \"and I said;\" which is correct, though somewhat free, exegesis. Compare with the expression, \"I have washed my hands in innocency,\" Job's remarkable words, \"If I wash myself with snow, and make my hands never so clean\" (Job 9:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For all the day long have been plagued. While the ungodly have prospered, and net been plagued at all (ver. 5), I, the representative of the righteous, have been \"plagued,\" or afflicted, continually. What, then, does goodness advantage me? And chastened every morning; literally, and my chastisement has beem every morning (comp. Job 7:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children; or, if I had said (Revised Version). If, when these feelings assailed me, and the lot of the ungodly man seemed to me much better than my own, I had resolved to speak out all my thoughts, and let them be generally known, then should I have dealt treacherously with (Revised Version) the generation of thy children. I should have deserted their cause; I should have hurt their feelings; I should have put a stumbling block in their way. Therefore, the psalmist implies, he said nothing - a reticence well worthy of imitation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - When I thought to know this; literally, and I meditated, that I might understand this. A process of careful thought and consideration is implied, during which the psalmist tried hard to understand the method of God's government, and to explain to himself its seeming anomalies. But he says, It was too painful for me. He did not succeed; he was baffled and perplexed, and the whole effort was a pain and a grief to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUntil I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Until I went into the sanctuary of God; literally, the sanctuaries (comp. Psalm 68:35; Psalm 84:1; Psalm 132:7). The three subdivisions of beth the tabernacle and the first temple, viz. the court, the holy place, and the holy of holies, constituted three sanctuaries. The psalmist, in his perplexity, took his doubts into the sanctuary of God, and there, \"in the calmness of the sacred court\" (Kay), reconsidered the hard problem. Compare Hezekiah's action with the perplexing letter of Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:14). Then understood I their end. There came to him in the sanctuary the thought that, to judge aright of the happiness or misery of any man, it is necessary to await the end (comp. Herod., 1:32; Soph., 'OEd. Tyr.,' ad fin.; Eurip., 'Andromach.,' 50:100; Aristot., ' Eth. Nic.,' 1:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Surely thou didst set them up in slippery places. The wicked have at no time any sure hold on their prosperity. They are a \"set in slippery places\" - places from which they may easily slip and fall. Thou castedst them down to destruction. The fall often comes, even in this life. The flourishing cities of the plain are destroyed by fire from heaven; Pharaoh's land is ruined by the plagues, and his host destroyed in the Red Sea; Sennacherib's army perishes in a night; Jezebel is devoured by dogs; Athaliah is slain with the sword; Antiochus Epiphanes perishes in a distant expedition; Herod Agrippa is eaton of worms; persecutors, like Nero, Galerius, Julian, come to untimely ends. A signal retribution visits the wicked in hundreds and thousands of instances. When it does not, the question remains - Is death the end? This point is not formally brought forward, but it underlies the whole argument; and, unless retribution after death be regarded as certain, a single exception to the general rule of retribution in this life would upset the solution which the psalmist finds satisfactory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! There is something very striking in the suddenness with which the prosperity of a wicked man often collapses. Saul, Jezebel, Athaliah, Epiphanes, Herod Agrippa, are cases in point, likewise Nero, Galerius, Julian. The first and second Napoleonic empires may also be cited. They are utterly consumed with terrors; literally, they perish; they come to an end through terrors (comp. Job 18:11; Job 24:17; Job 27:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. As men despise their dreams when they awake from them, so, when God \"stirs up himself and awakes to judgment\" (Psalm 35:23), he will despise such mere semblances of humanity (Psalm 39:6) as the wicked are.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thus my heart was grieved; literally, for my heart was grieved, or \"was soured.\" The \"for\" refers to a suppressed phrase of self-condemnation, \"But at the time I did not see all this - the solution did not present itself to me.\" I was too full of grief and bitterness to consider the matter calmly and dispassionately. And I was pricked in my reins; i.e. \"a pang of passionate discontent had pierced my inmost being\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee. I had no more intelligence than the brute beasts; I was wholly unable to reason aright (comp.

Psalm 18:35; Psalm 89:21; Psalm 119:117).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel. The psalmist expresses full confidence in God's continual guidance through all life's dangers and difficulties, notwithstanding his own shortcomings and\" foolishness.\" He then looks beyond this life, and exclaims, And afterward (thou wilt) receive me to glory. Even Professor Cheyne sees m this the story of Enoch spiritualized.\" \"Walking with God,\" he says, \"is followed by a reception with glory, or into glory; and he compares the passage with Psalm 49:16, which he has previously explained as showing that \"the poet has that religious intuition which forms the kernel of the hope of immortality.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Whom have I in heaven but thee? Who is there in all the host of heaven on whom I can place any reliance, excepting thee? None of thy \"holy ones,\" neither angel nor archangel, can afford me any support or sustenance, preserve or guide or save me, but THOU only (comp. Job 5:1). And there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee. Much less can earth supply me with a substitute for God. On him my heart's affections are centred (comp. Psalm 63:1, \"My soul thirsteth top thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - My flesh and my heart faileth. The meaning is, \"Though my flesh and my heart fail utterly, though my whole corporeal and animal nature fade away and come to nothing, yet something in the nature of a heart - the true 'I,' consciousness, will remain, and will be upheld by God.\" God is the Strength of my heart, and my Portion forever. \"A strong assertion of personal immortality\" (Cook). \"This is the mysticism of faith; we are on the verge of St. Paul's conception of the πνεῦμα, the organ of life in God\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish. As God is the source of all life, to be \"far from him\" is to perish - to have this life depart from us, even if existence of any kind remains. The psalmist is vague with respect to the ultimate fate of the wicked, confident only of the continued existence, in a condition which he declares to be \"good,\" of the righteous. Thou hast destroyed all them that go a-whoring from thee. The strong phrase here used is rare in the Psalms, occurring only in this place and in Psalm 106:39. It commonly refers to idolatrous practices, but is used sometimes of other kinds of declension and alienation from God (see Leviticus 20:6; Numbers 14:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm73:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - But it is good for me to draw near to God; or, \"but as for me, nearness to God is my good\" (Kay). Compare the well known hymn -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Nearer, my God, to thee,NEWLINENearer to thee;NEWLINEEven though it be a crossNEWLINEThat raiseth me;NEWLINEStill all my song shall be,NEWLINENearer, my God, to thee,NEWLINENearer to thee.\" I have put my trust in the Lord God; literally, in the Lord Jehovah (Adonai Jehovah) - an unusual combination.

With the intention of ever hereafter declaring and magnifying all thy works.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.74":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?VERSEENDNEWLINETHE misery of the Jews is here at its deepest (Four Friends, p. 291). The psalmist describes Jerusalem as fallen into \"perpetual ruins\" (ver. 3). The temple is violated (ver. 3); its carved work is ruthlessly cut down (ver. 6); the aid of fire has been called in to destroy it, and its walls are cast down to the ground (ver. 7). Nor has Jerusalem alone suffered. The object has been to \"make havoc\" of Israel \"altogether;\" and the enemy have spread themselves, and \"burnt up all the houses of God in the land\" (ver. 8). The prophets have succumbed; their voices are heard no more (ver. 9). A blasphemous enemy lords it over the entire country (vers. 10, 23), and sets up its banners as signs of its dominion (ver. 4). Three periods have been assigned for the composition of the psalm:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the time of the invasion of Shishak;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that of the Babylonian conquest; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the early Maceabean period, or the reign of Judas Maccabaens.NEWLINENEWLINEIn favour of the first is the ascription of the psalm in the \"title\" to Asaph. But all other considerations are against it. There is no evidence that Shishak ever entered Jerusalem. He certainly did not break down the carved work of the temple, or set the temple on fire, much less \"cast it down to the ground.\" His invasion was a mere raid, and Rehoboam seems to have bought his retreat by the sacrifice of the temple treasury (2 Kings 14:25-28; 2 Chronicles 12:2-12). The circumstances described in the psalm are also unsuitable to the reign of Judas Maccabaeus, in whose time the temple suffered desecration at the hands of the Syrians, but was not seriously damaged, much less demolished. Thus the only date suitable for the composition of the psalm is that immediately following the capture of the city under Nebuchadnezzar. We must explain the \"title\" by the consideration that Asaph, like Jeduthun and Heman, became a tribe name, attaching to all the descendants of the original Asaph, and was equivalent to \"sou of Asaph\" (see Ezra 2:41; Ezra 3:10; Nehemiah 7:44; Nehemiah 11:22). The psalm consists of three portions:NEWLINENEWLINE1. A complaint to God, including a description of all the horrors of the situation (vers. 1-11).NEWLINENEWLINE2. An enumeration of God's mercies in the olden time, as a foundation for hope that he will yet rescue Israel (vers. 12-17).NEWLINENEWLINE3. An earnest prayer for relief and restoration, and the re-establishment of the covenant (vers. 18-23). Verse 1. - O God, why hast thou cast us off forever? It could only have been in the extremity of distress that a devout Israelite believed, even for a time, that Israel was \"cast off forever\" (comp. Psalm 79:5, which must have been written nearly at the same period as this). Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture? God's anger \"smokes\" when it is hot and furious (see Psalm 18:8; Psalm 104:32; Psalm 44:5). It is now smoking \"against the sheep of his pasture\" - his own flock (Psalm 78:53), his peculiar people (comp. Jeremiah 23:4; Jeremiah 50:6, 17; and Psalm 79:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; or, which thou didst purchase of old. The reference is to the redemption out of Egypt (see Exodus 15:16). God is besought, though he has forgotten, once more to remember his people, and urged to do so by the memory of his former mercies (comp. vers. 12-17). The rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; rather, which thou didst redeem to be the tribe of thine inheritance; i.e. the people of thine inheritance. \"The conventional expression, 'the tribes of Israel,' was not always used after the fall of the northern kingdom\" (Cheyne); comp. Jeremiah 10:16; Jeremiah 51:19. This Mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt (comp. Psalm 73: 68). The expression, \"this Mount Zion,\" implies that the psalm is composed either by one of the exiles before he is removed from the Holy Land, or by one of those who were left behind by the conquerors (2 Kings 25:12, 22; Jeremiah 42:10; Jeremiah 52:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; or, the perpetual ruins. God is asked to visit and protect, or else to visit and inspect, the desolate ruins with which the Babylonians have covered Mount Zion. Even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. The Babylonians had plundered the temple of all its treasures, breaking the precious Phoenician bronze work into pieces, and carrying off everything of value that was portable (2 Kings 25:13-17). They had also \"burnt the house of the Lord \"(ver. 9), and \"broken down the walls of Jerusalem\" (ver. 10) and the walls of the temple to a large extent (see below, ver. 7). It is quite certain that neither Shishak nor the Syrians under Antiochus Epiphanes created any such devastation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; or, have roared; i.e. have created disturbances, or raised tumults. The temple did not pass into the enemy's hands without fighting and bloodshed; the battlecry of the assailants and their shouts of triumph when victorious resounded through it (comp. Lamentations 2:7) They set up their ensigns for signs. Probably for tokens of victory and dominion. Scarcely as objects of worship, since their intention was to destroy the temple and leave Jerusalem desolate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees; rather, they seemed as men that plied aloft hatchets in a thicket of trees (so Kay, Canon Cook, Professor Cheyne, and the Revised Version); i.e. they plied their hatchets with as little reverence as if they had been hewing timber in a copse of wood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. The \"carved work\" (pittuchim) of the temple consisted of the cherubim and palm trees and open flowers which formed the decoration of the temple walls (see 1 Kings 6:29, where the same word, pittuchim, is used). This superficial carved work may have been broken down for the sake of the gold with which it was overlaid (1 Kings 6:22, 32, 35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They have cast tire into thy sanctuary; or, they have set thy sanctuary fire (Revised Version). The temple of Solomon was burnt by Nebuchadnezzar (2 Kings 25:9; 2 Chronicles 36:19). That of Zerubbabel was never burnt, but was entirely rebuilt, and on a much larger scale, by Herod the Great. That of Herod the Great was burnt in the siege by Titus. They have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy Name to the ground (comp. Lamentations 2:6; Lamentations 4:1). The very foundations of the second temple had to be laid by Zerubbabel (Ezra 3:6, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them altogether. It was, no doubt, the intention of Nebuchadnezzar to destroy Israel as a nation. Hence the complete destruction of the city and temple (2 Kings 25:9, 10; 2 Chronicles 36:19; Lamentations 2:1-9, etc.); hence the deportation of all the strength of the nation (2 Kings 24:14-16; 2 Kings 25:11), and their settlement in the far off region of Babylonia; hence the desolation, not only of Jerusalem, but of \"all the habitations of Jacob\" (Lamentations 2:2), all the \"strongholds of the daughter of Judah\" (Lamentations 2:2, 5). They have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land. The synagogue system was first introduced by Ezra, according to Jewish tradition; and it has been argued that the mention of \"synagogues\" here - literally, \"sacred meeting places\" - proves the psalm to be Maccabean. But meeting places for worship, other than the temple, always existed in Palestine, both before and after its erection. Mesha speaks of having plundered a \"house of Jehovah\" in his war with Ahab ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11:p. 167); and it is plain from 2 Kings 4:23 that religious meetings were held by the prophets, probably in houses devoted to the purpose, during the period of the divided monarchy. Hezekiah's destruction of the high places (2 Kings 18:4) is not likely to have interfered with the use of these buildings, to which no savour of idolatry can have attached in the mind of the most violent iconoclast. I should therefore believe, with Leopold Low, that buildings existed before the Exile, in which religious instruction was given by authorized teachers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - We see not our signs. Some suppose \"standards\" to be meant, as in ver. 4, where the same word is used; but it is, perhaps, better to understand, with Dr. Kay, \"Divine ordinances, which were standing signs of God's presence - as the tabernacle, the sacrifices, the sabbaths.\" There is no more any prophet. It has been said that this shows the psalm not to have been written on the occasion of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, since Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were, all of them, then living. But the writer only means to say that there are no prophets in Palestine, where he is residing. Jeremiah in Egypt, Ezekiel on the banks of Chebar, Daniel in Babylon, are nothing to him, even if he knows of their existence, and in no way fill up the gap whereof he complains. Neither is there among us any who knoweth how long. Jeremiah's prophecy of the seventy years (Jeremiah 25:11, 12) did net remove the doubt, since it was uncertain from what event the seventy years were to be counted. Jeremiah's prophecies, moreover, were not yet, in all probability, collected into a volume, and so may not have been known to the psalmist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy Name forever? There is no contradiction between these two clauses. The psalmist wishes to ask two things:NEWLINENEWLINE1. Is the present distress to continue forever?NEWLINENEWLINE2. And if not, how long is it to endure? It is true that he inverts the natural order of the questions; but this is so common a mode of speech, that grammarians have given it a name, and call it ὔστερον(πρότερον.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? Why dost thou keep back the right hand of thy power, hiding it in thy besom? Why not show forth thy power, and consume them, as it were, in a moment? (See the next clause.) Pluck it out of thy bosom; rather, out with it frown thy bosom, and consume them. The psalmist sees no reason why the Babylonians should not be consumed, and Israel delivered, at once. He has an insufficient sense of the greatness of Israel's sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - Comfort springs from the thought of God's previous deliverances of his people, and of his other great mercies. The deliverance from Egypt has the foremost place (vers. 13,14), as the most striking. Then the deliverance from the wilderness, and the passage of Jordan (ver. 15). From these the poet passes to God's mercies in nature - day and night, light and sun, set bounds of earth and sea, alternations of the seasons - all formed and arranged by the Almighty (vers. 16, 17). Verse 12. - For God is my King of old (comp. Psalm 44:4). As \"King,\" he has power to perform all that he wills, to set up and to cast down, to give into the enemy's hand and to deliver. Working salvation in the midst of the earth. Not in any imaginary earth centre, but, as Professor Cheyne says, \"quite broadly, in various parts of the earth\" (comp. Exodus 8:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength. A clear reference to Exodus 14:21 (comp. Psalm 77:16; Psalm 78:13; Psalm 106:9). Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. The dragon (tannim) is frequently used as a symbol of Egyptian power (see Isaiah 51:9; Ezekiel 29:3; Ezekiel 32:2). The allusion here is to the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the waters of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:27-30; Exodus 15:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces. Here the metaphor is only slightly varied, leviathan, \"the crocodile,\" being substituted for tannim, \"the dragon,\" or \"sea monster,\" as the representative of the might of Egypt. And gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. The corpses of the Egyptians thrown up upon the Red Sea shores (Exodus 14:30) are certainly the \"meat\" intended. Whether the \"people of dwellers in the wilderness\" are cannibal tribes, or jackals and hyenas, is perhaps doubtful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood; rather, and the torrent (comp. Exodus 17:6; Numbers 20:11). Thou driedst up mighty rivers; i.e. the Jordan (Joshua 3:13, et seqq.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The day is thine, the night also is thine; thou hast prepared the light and the sun (see Genesis 1:5, 15, 16); rather, thou hast prepared him light and sun. \"Luminary\" (מָאור) is probably a class name for the heavenly lights generally. The sun is then particularized, as so much the most important of the luminaries. But the result is \"an imperfect parallelism\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou hast set all the borders of the earth. The \"borders of the earth\" are the boundaries of land and sea, which are ascribed to God in Genesis 1:9 (comp. Job 26:10; Job 38:8; Psalm 33:7; Proverbs 8:29; Jeremiah 5:22). Thou hast made summer and winter; literally, summer and winter thou didst form them; i.e. they are the result of thy arrangement of creation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-23. - In conclusion, the psalmist prays earnestly that God will deliver his people from their wicked oppressors (vers. 18, 19), that he will remember his covenant (ver. 20), cause the oppressed ones to praise him (ver. 21), and assert himself against those who insult and oppose him (vers. 22, 23). Verse 18. - Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy Name (comp. Lamentations 1:7; Lamentations 2:7, 157 16). Every nation of idolaters is a \"foolish people\" to the sacred writers, whatever cleverness or intellectual capacity it may possess. Nabal, the word translated \"foolish,\" designates a folly that is closely akin to wickedness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - O deliver net the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the multitude of the wicked; rather, O deliver not thy turtle dove unto the greedy multitude (Revised Version margin). Israel is beautifully compared to a pet dove, the gentlest and tenderest of birds. The Babylonians are the \"greedy multitude\" ready to kill and devour it. Forget not the congregation (or, the multitude) of thy poor forever. The \"multitude of God's poor\" is being carried off into a cruel captivity, or else left as a miserable remnant in an exhausted and desolated land - in either ease needing much God's protection and \"remembrance.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Have respect unto the covenant. The \"covenant\" intended is probably that made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, whereby Canaan was assured to their descendants, as \"the lot of their inheritance.\" Israel is being deprived of its inheritance, and dragged off into \"dark places.\" Will not \"respect for his covenant\" induce God to interpose, and even now at the last gasp deliver his afflicted ones? For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. Israel is being dragged into \"dark places of the earth\" - benighted lands, where there is no glimmer of the light of God's truth - and lands, moreover, which are \"full of habitations of cruelty,\" abodes, i.e., where captives taken in war are treated with harshness and violence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - O let not the oppressed return ashamed; i.e. let not this oppressed nation turn their back on thee in shame and confusion at thy forsaking them. Rather, let the poor and needy praise thy Name; i.e. show them some mercy, some deliverance, which may turn their shame into joy, and call forth from them songs of praise.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Arise, O God, plead thine own cause; i.e. assert thyself, show forth thy power, avenge thyself on thine enemies. Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily (comp. ver. 18, and see the comment ad loc.). In the ancient world the conquest of a people was always regarded as a triumph over the people's god or gods. Naturally, insults to the god found a place in the victor's songs of triumph (see 2 Kings 19:10-13; Isaiah 10:8-11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm74:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Forget not the voice of thine enemies. God does not forget insults of this kind, but punishes them (see 2 Kings 19:28, \"Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou earnest\"). He punished Babylon after a time with extreme severity (see Jeremiah 50 and 51). The tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually; rather, ascendeth continually - goes up before God's throne, crying for vengeance (comp. Genesis 4:10; Genesis 18:20, 21; Exodus 3:9, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.75":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks; for that thy Name is near thy wondrous works declare; literally, and thy Name is near (i.e. thy providence and care are close to us); this do thy wondrous works declare. The \"wondrous works\" are those of times past (comp.

It is agreed that the speaker, in this verse and the next, is God, who announces that he is about to descend in judgment. This, however, he will do \"at his own set time,\" for which men must wait patiently (comp. Habakkuk 2:3). I will judge uprightly; or, \"with uprightness\" (comp. Psalm 58:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it.

They \"melt\" with fear (Psalm 44:6), either at God's coming in judgment, or at the dissolution which a hostile invasion is bringing on their land. I bear up the pillars of it. Meanwhile God upholds, and will uphold, both the moral and physical order of things. He will neither suffer the earth to be moved, nor the supports on which society depends to fail and crumble away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I said. It is doubtful who is the speaker. Professor Cheyne regards the entire passage from the beginning of ver. 2 to the end of ver. 5 as spoken by the Almighty; but most commentators assign vers. 4 and 5 to the psalmist or the people of Israel. Unto the fools; i.e. to the enemy which was attacking Israel; literally, to the boasters, or to the arrogant ones (see Revised Version). Deal not foolishly; rather, deal not so arrogantly. Do not set yourselves so proudly against the Almighty. And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn; i.e. be not fierce and menacing, like a bull who threatens with his horns.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Lift not up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck. The phrase, \"a stiff neck,\" common in the Pentateuch (Exodus 32:9; Exodus 33:3, 5; Exodus 34:9; Deuteronomy 9:6, 13; Deuteronomy 10:16; Deuteronomy 31:27), is rare elsewhere. It expresses pride, arrogance, and obstinacy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. So Hupfeld, Kay, Canon Cook, and the Revised Version Others suggest the meaning to be, \"For it is not from the east, nor is it from the west, nor yet from the mountainous desert [that help cometh].\" But the ellipse of the main idea is improbable. The address is to the enemies who threaten Israel, \"Lift not up your horns - speak not proudly - for exaltation comes not from any earthly quarter - east, west, north, or south\" (\"north\" being omitted, as sufficiently implied in the others); it is God alone who gives it, and he is not likely to give it to you.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But God is the Judge (comp. Psalm 50:6; Psalm 82:1; Psalm 94:2; and, especially, the original of all the later passages, Genesis 18:25). He putteth down one, and setteth up (or, exalteth) another (comp. 1 Samuel 2:7; Daniel 2:21; Daniel 4:17). True equally of nations and of individuals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red. The \"cup of God's fury\" is a frequent metaphor with the prophets (Isaiah 51:17, 22; Jeremiah 25:15, 17, 28; Jeremiah 49:12; Lamentations 4:21; Ezekiel 23:31-33; Habakkuk 2:16, etc.); and is commonly represented as full of wine, which his enemies have to drink. The \"redness\" of the wine typifies the shedding of blood. It is full of mixture. Mingled, i.e., with spices, and so made stronger and more efficacious (see Proverbs 9:2; Proverbs 23:30; Song of Solomon 8:2; Isaiah 5:22). And he poureth out of the same. God pours out the cup of his fury on all nations, or persons, whom he chooses to afflict, and they are compelled to drink of it (Jeremiah 25:15-28). But the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. To drink a cup, dregs and all, is to empty it wholly, to swallow down all its contents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But I will declare forever; i.e. \"I will declare these things\" - viz.

On the force of the phrase, \"God of Jacob,\" see the comment upon Psalm 20:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm75:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off. Besides declaring God's judgments and singing his praises, the psalmist adds that he will, as far as lies in his power, seek to advance God's cause, and establish his kingdom, by checking, controlling, and putting down the wicked. This he expresses by the metaphor, \"I will cut off their horns;\" i.e. bring down their haughtiness, and deprive them of the power of doing mischief. But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted. Then, as a necessary consequence, \"the horns of the righteous\" - their power and might and glory - will be exalted.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.76":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In Judah is God known (comp.

(So Professor Cheyne.) \"Salem\" is the peaceful place, the place where God's presence breathed peace and tranquillity. It is only used here and in Genesis 14:11. Is his tabernacle; literally, his tent (comp. Psalm 15:1; Psalm 27:5, 6; Psalm 61:4). The temple is meant, as even Professor Cheyne sees. It took the place of the original \"tabernacle,\" and was modelled upon it. And his dwelling place in Zion; or, \"his lair\" (comp.

This would sufficiently suit the destruction of Sennacherib's army, which certainly occurred in the neighbourhood, though not very close to the city (see 2 Kings 19:32, 38). The word translated \"arrows\" (רשׁפי) means properly \"lightnings\" (comp. Psalm 78:48), and expresses the swift flight of the arrow, not actual \"fiery darts.\" The shield, and the sword, and the battle; rather, the war equipment (Kay, Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. The psalmist, in this, the main portion of his psalm, directly addresses God. \"Thou, O God,\" he says, \"art glorious,\" or \"terrible\" (comp. ver. 7, where the same word is used), \"and excellent, more than the mountains of prey,\" or perhaps \"from the mountains of spoil;\" i.e. from Jerusalem, where the spoils of the Assyrians are laid up, and where thou sittest and rulest. (So Professor Cheyne and Canon Cook.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The stout hearted are spoiled.

Isaiah 10:12-14, \"The stout heart of the King of Assyria\"), is itself spoiled in turn. They have slept their sleep. They have slept, and, as they slept (2 Kings 19:35), they found it indeed a sleep, even the sleep of death. And none of the men of might have found their hands. The mighty men, suddenly assaulted by the grim destroyer, Death, can make no resistance; they are paralyzed; they cannot even move a hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob.

Metonymy for the charioteers and the horsemen (comp. Isaiah 43:17).

By the destruction of Sennacherib's host, God spoke, as it were, with a voice of thunder, to the whole earth. He delivered a \"judgment,\" or a \"sentence\" (Revised Version), which could not be ignored. The earth feared, and was still. All the world, i.e. all the Oriental world, feared. The attention of the nations of Western Asia generally was attracted (2 Chronicles 32:23), and their minds were affected with a wholesome fear of Jehovah. The result was that they remained at rest and gave Israel rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When God arose to judgment (see the preceding verses). God's \"rising\" is an anthropomorphism, drawn from the tact that men \"rise up\" when they proceed to take vengeance (comp. Psalm 3:7; Psalm 7:6; Psalm 44:26; Psalm 68:1, etc.). To save all the meek of the earth. God's vengeances on the wicked are, in great measure, for the relief of the righteous. Sennacherib's discomfiture relieved \"the meek of the earth,\" i.e. not only Israel, but many other downtrodden and oppressed nations. The psalmist's sympathies are with all the victims of Assyrian ambition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee. The sentiment is general, but no doubt there is a special reference to the recent deliverance. The \"wrath of man,\" i.e. man's wicked fury and hostility of God and his people, shall give occasion for great deeds on God's part - deeds which will bring him praise and honour. The remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. Either, \"the unexpended fury of thine enemies, that which they have not vented, thou wilt hold in check, and prevent from doing mischief;\" or else,\" with thine own unexpended wrath wilt thou gird thyself against the wicked, as with a weapon.\" (So Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTVow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God. The people of Israel are now addressed. Under the circumstances, they are sure to have made vows to God in the time of their great trouble, before the deliverance came. Now, when the deliverance has come, let them pay these vows. Let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared; literally, unto the Terrible One. By \"all that are round about him\" the psalmist seems to mean, not Israel only, but those other oppressed ones who had shared the benefit of the deliverance (comp. ver. 9). That presents were brought by some of these is recorded by the writer of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 32:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm76:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He shall cut off the spirit of princes. \"The spirit\" seems here to mean \"the life.\" God cuts off princes in their prime as a gardener cuts off bunches of grapes (comp. Isaiah 18:5). He is terrible to the kings of the earth. Not \"princes\" only - נגידים - but \"kings\" - מלכים - also are cut off in their prime when God pleases. Sennacherib's untimely death (2 Kings 19:37) followed not many years after the destruction of his host, in which there must have been many \"princes.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.77":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice. The repetition marks the intensity of the appeal, \"with my voice\" - that the appellant is not content with mere silent prayer. And he gave ear unto me; rather, \"that he may hearken unto me\" (Cheyne), or \"and do thou hearken unto me\" (Hengstenberg, Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord (comp. Genesis 35:3; Habakkuk 3:16). My sore ran in the night; rather, my band was stretched out in the night (Cook, Cheyne, Revised Version); comp. Psalm 28:2. And ceased not. He continued in prayer all through the night. My soul refused to be comforted (comp. Genesis 37:35; Jeremiah 31:15). He was like Jacob when he lost Joseph, or like Rachel weeping for her children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I remembered God, and was troubled. The tenses used are present rather than past; they mark continuance; they describe the condition in which the writer remained for days or weeks. He thought of God, but the thought troubled him. It was God who had brought the calamity, whatever it was, upon his people. Seemingly, he had \"cast them off\" - he had \"forgotten to be gracious\" (see vers. 7-9). I complained; rather, I muse or meditate (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne). And my spirit was overwhelmed; or, waxeth faint, as in the Prayer book Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou holdest mine eyes waking; literally, thou boldest the watches of mine eyes; i.e. preventedst me from obtaining any sleep. I am so troubled that I cannot speak; literally, I was perplexed and did not speak. The perplexity was probably caused by an inability to understand God's ways. Why had he afflicted his people? Was the affliction always to continue? Was Israel cast off?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I have considered; rather, I considered. In my perplexity, when I could no longer speak, I betook myself to meditation. I considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. He called to mind, i.e., God's doings in the past (comp. vers. 14-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I call to remembrance my song in the night. He bethought himself of the songs of thanksgiving which he used to sing to God in the night (comp. Job 35:10) on account of mercies received; but this did not comfort him. \"Nessun maggior dolore che ricordarsi di tempo felice nella miseria.\" I commune with mine own heart, and my spirit made diligent search; or, \"and I diligently searched out my spirit\" (Cheyne). The results of the searchings out seem to be given in vers. 7-10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWill the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Will the Lord cast off forever? The psalmist asked himself in the night such questions as these: Is it really to be supposed that God will cast off his people forever? And will he be favourable (or, gracious) no more? Surely such desertion is incredible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Is his mercy clean gone forever? The mercy which he has so long shown towards Israel (comp. Psalm 78.). Doth his promise fail forevermore? The promise which he made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would be with their seed forever (Genesis 17:7-13; Genesis 26:24; Genesis 35:11, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Can God, who forgets nothing and no one (Isaiah 49:15), have forgotten his own nature, which is to be \"merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness\" (Exodus 34:6)? Assuredly not. The higher nature in the psalmist, as Professor Cheyne observes, expostulates with the lower one. Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Has he shut them up, \"as in a closed hand\" (Kay, Canon Cook)? (comp. Deuteronomy 15:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And I said, This is my infirmity; i.e. \"the fault is not in God, but in myself\" - in my own weakness and want of faith. But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High. There is no \"I will remember\" in the original, which expresses the thought of the writer imperfectly; but some such phrase must of necessity be supplied. The words are retained in the Revised Version and by Professor Cheyne. The remembrance of God's mercies during the many years that are past is that which best sustains us in a time of severe trouble.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - I will remember the works of the Lord. The same thought is carried on and expressed more clearly in the present and the ensuing verse. Then a special remembrance is made of one particular mercy - the deliverance from Egypt (vers. 13-20). Surely I will remember thy wonders of old (comp. Exodus 15:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings; rather, as in the Revised Version, and muse on thy doings (comp. ver. 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary; rather, in holiness. God's \"way\" - his conduct, his proceedings - however strange and mysterious it may seem to us, is always holy, i.e. just and right (comp. Genesis 18:25; Job 8:3). Who is so great a God as our God? God is both good and great; just in himself, and able to execute justice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou art the God that doest wonders. The gods of the heathen could do nothing. They were weakness, vanity, nothingness. Jehovah alone was powerful. He could work, and could \"work wonders.\" This clause prepares the way for the magnificent description of the deliverance of Israel at the Red Sea, which occupies vers. 16-19. Thou hast declared thy strength among the people; rather, among the peoples - i.e. in the sight of many heathen nations (comp. Exodus 15:14-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou hast with thine arm (i.e. with thy mighty strength) redeemed thy people. The deliverance from Egypt is constantly called a \"redemption\" (Exodus 6:6; Exodus 15:13; Deuteronomy 7:8; Deuteronomy 9:26, etc.; 2 Samuel 7:23; 1 Chronicles 17:21, etc.). It is brought forward here \"as the greatest and most wonderful of all the works of God, and hence as containing the strongest pledge of future deliverance\" (Hengstenberg). The sons of Jacob and Joseph. A new designation of the people of Israel, and one which elsewhere occurs only in Obadiah 1:18. Professor Cheyne suggests that it is a geographical division - by Jacob southern Israel, and by Joseph northern Israel, being intended (comp. Hosea 12:2; Amos 5:6, 15; Amos 6:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee. Professor Cheyne regards this and the three following verses as not belonging properly to this psalm, but a \"fragment of another,\" accidentally transferred to this place. But most commentators see in the passage a most essential portion of the poem. It is the thought of the deliverance from Egypt that especially sustains and comforts the psalmist in his extreme distress. The passage is prepared for by vers. 11 and 14, and is exegetical of ver. 15. They were afraid. They shrank from the sight of God, and made a way for his people to pass over. The depths also were troubled. The very abysses trembled with fear, and moved themselves, leaving the bottom of the sea dry (see Exodus 14:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The clouds poured out water. The description here becomes more poetical than historical, unless, indeed, we may suppose that the writer possessed, besides what is said in Exodus, some traditional account of the passage. The skies sent out a sound; or, \"uttered a voice\" - the voice of the thunder, beyond a doubt (compare next verse). Thine arrows also went abroad; i.e. lightnings darted hither and thither (see Psalm 18:14; 2 Samuel 22:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The voice of thy thunder was in the heavens; rather, in the whirlwind (Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). A storm of wind usually accompanies thunder and lightning. This the author, with poetical exaggeration, heightens into a \"whirlwind\" (comp. Psalm 83:13; Isaiah 17:13). The lightnings lightened the world. More hyperbole. Not only did they \"go abroad\" (ver. 17), darting hither and thither, but their intense brightness illuminated the whole earth. The earth trembled and shook. Through the reverberation of air, the earth seems to shake in a heavy thunderstorm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thy way is in the sea; rather, was in the sea. Thou wentest, i.e., in person before thy people in their passage across the dry bed of the Red Sea; truly there, though invisible (comp. Exodus 15:13; Psalm 78:52, 53; Psalm 106:9; Isaiah 63:13). And thy path in the great waters; literally, thy paths. So the Revised Version. And thy footsteps are not known; rather, were not. No one perceived thy presence, much less discerned thy footsteps. As in external nature and in the human heart, God worked secretly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm77:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thou leddest thy people like a flock (comp. Isaiah 63:11; Psalm 78:52). By the hand of Moses and Aaron. God was the true Leader. Moses and Aaron were but his instruments. Moses at one time refused to lead any more, unless God would pledge himself to go up with him (see Exodus 33:12-16).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.78":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - The introduction calls special attention to the teaching that is about to be put forth, which it declares to be traditional (ver. 3), and, further, to be the sort of instruction which God had especially commanded to be given to his people by their teachers (vers. 5, 6) for their edification (vers. 7, 8). Verse 1. - Give ear, O my people, to my law; rather, to my teaching. Hat-torah - torah with the article - is \"the Law;\" but torah alone is any teaching or instruction. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. Dr. Kay regards the words of ver. 1 as \"God's own words,\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) on account of the expression, \"O my people;\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) on account of \"my Law.\" But \"my people\" is not inappropriate in the mouth of a psalmist, and occurs in Psalm 59:11 and Psalms 144:2. It \"indicates the love in which the effort of the psalmist originated\" (Hengstenberg). And \"law,\" as already observed, is not the proper, or at any rate not the only, meaning of torah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will open my mouth in a parable. The facts of Israelitish history. are the \"parable,\" the inner meaning of which it is for the intelligent to grasp. They are φωνᾶντα συνετοῖσιν. I will utter dark sayings of old (comp. Proverbs 1:6). Khidoth (חידות) are properly \"riddles\" (see Judges 14:12). Here the idea is that God's dealings with his people had been \"riddles,\" whereto the psalmist would give the clue (comp. vers. 21, 22, 33, 56-59, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us; or, \"recounted to us\" (Kay). The facts of their past history had been handed down orally from father to son among the Israelites, not simply learnt from their sacred writings. So the facts of Christianity have reached us, not merely through the New Testament, but also by the teaching of the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - We will not hide them from their children. They shall still be handed down in the same way. We of this generation will still continue the practice of handing down, by word of mouth, to the next generation, how God has dealt with Israel. Asaph's psalms were written, it must be remembered, to be recited in the services of the sanctuary (comp. 2 Chronicles 29:30). Showing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord; i.e. the actions for which he deserves praise. And his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done (comp. vers. 12-16, and vers. 23-55).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel. The \"testimony\" and the \"law\" are the whole series of commands given by God to his people, beginning with the directions concerning circumcision in Genesis (Genesis 17:10-14), and terminating with the last precept in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 32:46). They may include also the teachings of God through history. These he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children (see Exodus 12:26, 27; Exodus 13:8, 14, 15; Deuteronomy 4:9; Deuteronomy 6:7; Deuteronomy 11:19; Deuteronomy 32:46, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - That the generation to come might know them. \"The generation to come\" is the next generation, that immediately following those to whom the command was directly given. Even the children which should be born. Their actual sons and daughters. Who should arise and declare them to their children. The first generation were to hand the knowledge on to the second, the second to the third, and so on. This is the way in which the hulk of human knowledge actually passes on. Not much is learnt from books without a teacher (see Acts 8:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - That they might set their hope in God. Instruction in God's Law, and in his treatment of their forefathers, would naturally tend to make the Israelites \"set their hope in God,\" who in the past had done so much for them. And not forget the works of God. They could not well forget, it' they were perpetually reminded of them. But keep his commandments. If they bore God's works - i.e. his many mercies - in mind, they would be the more disposed to obedience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation (comp. Deuteronomy 21:18, 20, for the combination of the two words). The \"stubbornness\" of Israel is noted in Deuteronomy 9:27; Judges 2:19; and frequently by Jeremiah (Jeremiah 3:17; Jeremiah 7:24; Jeremiah 9:14; Jeremiah 11:8, etc.); their \"rebelliousness\" in Deuteronomy 9:7, 24; Isaiah 30:1, 9; Isaiah 65:2; Jeremiah 5:23; Ezekiel 2:3-8; Ezekiel 3:9, 26, 27; Ezekiel 12:2, 3, etc. (compare also for the idea 2 Kings 17:14-17:2 Chronicles 36:14-16; Ezra 9:6, 7; Nehemiah 1:6, 7; Daniel 9:5-11; and Acts 7:51, \"Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as your fathers did, so do ye\"). A generation that set not their heart aright; literally, that prepared not their heart - did not make it ready to receive Divine influences (see 1 Samuel 7:3; Job 11:13; 2 Chronicles 20:33). And whose spirit was not steadfast with God. It was not that Israel was wholly without religious feeling, but the feeling was fickle, unsteadfast, never to be depended on (comp. Exodus 32:1-6; Numbers 16:41, 42; Judges 2:17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-72. - The historical portion of the psalm now follows. It commences with some general remarks on the transgressions of Ephraim, i.e. of Israel while under the guidance of Ephraim - from Joshua to Samuel (vers. 9-11). It then proceeds to details, and sketches the Israelite history. from the deliverance out of Egypt to the establishment of David's kingdom (vers, 12-72). Verse 9. - The children of Ephraim (comp. ver. 67). Ephraim was the leading tribe, from the appointment of Joshua to succeed Moses until the establishment of Saul as king. Hence the tabernacle was set up within the territory of Ephraim (Joshua 18:1). The importance of Ephraim appears in Judges 3:27; Judges 7:24; Judges 8:1, 2; Judges 10:9; Judges 12:1-6. Being armed, and carrying bows. There is no \"and\" in the original. \"Carrying bows\" is exegetical of \"being armed\" (comp. 2 Chronicles 17:17). Turned back in the day of battle. The allusion is not to any one particular occasion, but to the ill success of Israel under the leadership of Ephraim during the whole period of the Judges (see Judges 2:14; Judges 3:8, 13, 31; Judges 4:2; Judges 6:1; Judges 10:7, 12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They kept not the covenant of God (comp.

The miracles of Egypt are, perhaps, the most striking series in Jewish history. A more particular account of them is given below (vers. 44-53). They were wrought \"in the field of Zoan,\" i.e. in the rich flat tract east and south of the city of Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San. (On this place, see Mr. Reginald Peele's 'Cities of Egypt,' pp. 64-88.) This fact could not have been gathered from Exodus, but must have come to the writer from the tradition of which he speaks in ver. 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through (see Exodus 14:21, 22). And he made the waters to stand as an heap. The expression is taken from the Song of Moses (Exodus 15:8). It must be understood poetically.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In the daytime also he led them with a cloud.

The word has no article. The reference is probably to both Exodus 17:6 and Numbers 20:8-11. And gave them drink as out of the great depths; rather, \"and gave them drink abundantly, as out of the depths\" (so Cheyne and the Revised Version). On the abundance of the water, see Numbers 20:11, and compare the next verse: He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the Most High in the wilderness. The two provocations of a demand for bread (Exodus 16:3) and a demand for flesh (Numbers 11:4) are joined together in the present passage, as the two occasions of giving water are in vers. 15, 16. Only the second of these two provocations was subsequent to the (first) giving of water; but the psalmist does not allow himself to be bound by considerations of strict chronological accuracy. He is a poet, and not an historian; though at present he is treating of history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust; rather, by asking food (Kay, Cheyne, Alexander). The term used (אכל) is wide enough to include both bread (לחם) and flesh (שׁאר). \"For their lust\" (literally, \"for their soul\") means for the gratification of their carnal appetites (comp. Exodus 16:3; Numbers 11:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? (see Numbers 11:4). But the psalmist either feels himself at liberty to expand the account given in the Pentateuch, or has a further knowledge of the real feelings of the people, which has come to him by tradition (compare the comment on ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams (literally, the torrent courses) overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? These were probably the people's thoughts rather than their words. An \"evil heart of unbelief\" underlay their clamours and their murmurings. They doubted God's power to relieve their wants, notwithstanding all the proofs that they had had of his omnipotence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Therefore the Lord heard this. Though these might be unspoken thoughts, yet God would \"hear\" them, i.e. be aware of them; for \"he knoweth the very secrets of the heart.\" And was wroth (comp. vers. 59, 62; Deuteronomy 3:26). So a fire was kindled against Jacob. Not a material fire, as in Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1-3; and Numbers 16:35; but the fire of God's displeasure. And anger also came up against Israel (comp. vers. 30, 31; Numbers 11:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation. They trusted neither in God's power nor in his love; they neither believed that he would nor that he could save them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThough he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Though he had commanded the clouds from above; rather, and he commanded (Hengstenberg, Cheyne, Revised Version). The command was subsequent, not previous, to the want of faith (see Numbers 11:4-31). And opened the doors of heaven (comp. Genesis 7:11, \"The windows of heaven were opened\"). The expressions are, of course, poetical (see also 2 Kings 7:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them; rather, and rained down manna to eat, and gave them (comp. Exodus 16:13, 14). Of the corn of heaven (comp. Exodus 16:4; Psalm 105:40; John 6:6, 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMan did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Man did eat angels' food; literally, bread of the mighty ones, by which the LXX. and most commentators understand \"angels\" to be meant. \"Angels' food\" may mean either the actual food on which angels subsist, or food supplied by the ministration of angels, and derived from their dwelling place. It cannot be laid down dogmatically that angels require no food. He sent them meat to the full (comp. Exodus 16:3, where the Israelites contrast with their wretched life in the wilderness their life in Egypt, where they \"did eat bread to the full\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. Here, again, tradition seems to speak. The narrative in the Pentateuch has only, \"There went forth a wind from the Lord\" (Numbers 11:81).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - He rained flesh also upon them. With the expression, \"rained flesh,\" comp. Exodus 16:4, \"Behold, I will rain bread from heaven;\" and see also Genesis 19:24 and Exodus 9:23. As dust; i.e. \"as thick as dust\" (Prayer book Version). The quails lay \"as it were two cubits high\" for the distance of a day's journey round about each encampment (see Numbers 11:31). And feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. The commonest image of multiplicity (Genesis 22:17; Deuteronomy 33:19; Joshua 11:4; Judges 7:12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And he let it fall in the midst of their camp. The quails \"covered the camp\" (Exodus 16:13). Round about their habitations. They extended also round it on every side (Numbers 11:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - So they did eat, and were well filled; i.e. sated (comp. Numbers 11:19, 20). For he gave them their own desire; or, their own lust - that they lusted after (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - They were not estranged from their lust; i.e. their lust was not yet satiated - they were still indulging it. The meat was yet in their mouths, still undergoing mastication, when -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them (comp. Numbers 11:33, \"While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague\"). By \"the fattest of them,\" we are to understand the strongest and healthiest. And smote down the chosen men of Israel; rather, the young men, as in the margin, \"the ripened youths\" (Cheyne). Here, again, the author adds touches which he has not obtained from the Pentateuch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - For all this they sinned still. Neither gratitude for favours received (vers. 13-17), nor alarm at punishments inflicted (ver. 31), had any effect on the stiff-necked people; despite of both, they \"sinned still\" (comp. vers. 40, 41, 56-58). And believed not for his wondrous works. Unbelief was at the root of their contumacy. They could not deny God's mighty works in the past, but they did not accept them as any evidence of his power to do other mighty works in the future (see ver. 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. Their faithlessness was punished by their forty years of vain and purposeless wandering in the wilderness, and by the \"troubles\" that befell them there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - When he slew them, then they sought him (comp. Exodus 32:28, 35; Exodus 33:4, 10; Numbers 11:33; Numbers 16:48, 49, etc.). The repentance is not always noticed in the Mosaic narrative, being, as it was, short-lived, if not even feigned (ver. 36). But, no doubt, after each outpouring of the Divine vengeance, there was at least some show of repentance, as noted in Exodus 33:4. And they returned - i.e. turned back from their evil courses - and inquired early after God; rather, earnestly (Cheyne, Canon Cook).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And they remembered that God was their Rock; i.e. their strength and stay. The expression is first used of God in Deuteronomy 32:4. And the high God their Redeemer (comp. Psalm 19:14; Psalm 74:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth. The Revised Version is simpler and better, But they flattered him with their mouth. All that they said or did when alarmed by some judgment of God's was a mere pretence - an attempt to \"flatter\" and cozen God, and so win his favour. And they lied unto him with their tongues. They offered him a lip service, which was a \"lie,\" a mere semblance of real religion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - For their heart was not right with him. It is the worship of the heart alone which God values (see Deuteronomy 10:12; Proverbs 3:1; Proverbs 23:26, etc.). If the heart be not \"right with God,\" our worship is an offence to him. Neither were they steadfast in his covenant (comp. ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity. (On God's compassion, see Exodus 34:6, 7; Numbers 14:18; Psalm 103:8; Psalm 145:8.) And destroyed them not. The allusion is to such occasions as are noted in Exodus 32:10-14; Numbers 14:12-20; Numbers 16:21, 45-50, when God was on the point of destroying the whole people, but relented at the intercession of Moses. Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath (comp. Judges 2:11-16; Judges 3:8, 9; Judges 4:2, 15; Judges 6:1-8, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - For he remembered that they were but flesh (comp. Genesis 6:3). Flesh is weak, erring, frail - \"in us, that is, in our flesh, dwelleth no good thing\" (Romans 7:17) - God, therefore, who had made them \"flesh,\" had compassion on their weakness. A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again (comp. Job 7:7). Man is a mere passing breath - as light, as fleeting, as transitory - \"a vapour that appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away\" (James 4:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! (comp. Deuteronomy 31:27; Deuteronomy 32:15-18; Acts 7:30-43, etc.). That God is \"grieved\" at man's sins appears, not only from this passage, but also from Genesis 6:6; Psalm 95:10; Ephesians 4:30; Hebrews 3:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Yea, they turned back and tempted God; rather, again and again they tempted God (Hengstenberg, Kay, Cheyne); see Exodus 17:2, 7; Deuteronomy 6:16. And limited the Holy One of Israel (comp. Numbers 34:7, 8). This may mean either \"they set limits to his power in their own minds\" (see ver. 20), or \"they actually limited his power to help and succour them by their want of faith\" (comp. Mark 6:5, \"He could there do no mighty work,\" explained in Matthew 13:58 to have been \"because of their unbelief\"). The other meanings suggested - \"disgraced\" and\" provoked\" - are less probable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - They remembered not his hand; i.e. \"his doings\" (comp. ver. 11, they \"forgat his works\"). Nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. \"The day\" intended is probably that of the drowning of the Egyptians in the Red Sea (Exodus 15:28). In this the Egyptian signs culminated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - How he had wrought his signs in Egypt. The point just touched in ver. 12 is now taken up and expanded, with the object of showing to the Israelites of the writer's day what cause they had for thankfulness to God in the past and for trust in him for the future. And his wonders in the field of Zoan. \"The field of Zoan\" (sochet Zoan) is said to be mentioned in an Egyptian inscription (Zeitschrift fur Aegyptische Sprache for the year 1872, p. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - And had turned their rivers into blood (see Exodus 7:19, 20). \"Their rivers\" are the many branches of the Nile, some natural, some artificial (Herod., 2:17), by which Lower Egypt is traversed. And their floods; or, their streams; i.e. the smaller canals, which diffused the Nile water over the entire land. That they could not drink (see Exodus 7:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - He sent divers sorts of flies among them (see Exodus 8:24). A particular sort of fly or beetle is meant, rather than many different sorts. Dr. Kay and Professor Cheyne suggest \"dog flies\" - Canon Cook, the Blatta Orientalis. Which devoured them; i.e. \"preyed upon them,\" sucking out their life blood. And frogs, which destroyed them (see Exodus 8:6). The poet, not being an historian, does not give the plagues in their chronological order, neither regards himself as bound to mention all of them. He omits the third, and reverses the order of the second and fourth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust. Khasil (חָסִיל), here translated \"caterpillar,\" is probably either a particular kind of locust, or the locust in one of its stages. (On the plague of locusts in Egypt, see Exodus 10:14, 15.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - He destroyed their vines with hail (see Exodus 9:23-25). Here, again, there is an inversion of the order in which the plagues came, since the plague of hail preceded that of the locusts. There is also an addition to the narrative of Exodus in the mention of \"vines\" (see also Psalm 105:33), which may indicate a use of tradition. That vines were cultivated in Egypt is now generally acknowledged. And their sycamore trees with frost; or, with sleet - a variant of the \"hail\" in the other hemistich.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - He gave up their cattle also to the hall (comp. Exodus 9:19-21, 25). And their flocks to hot thunderbolts (see Exodus 9:24, 28, 29, 34). The \"fire which ran along the ground\" (Exodus 9:23) must have been caused by electrified clouds of high tension; the highly charged drops of rain meeting the inductively charged earth, and sparking across when within striking distance. This is believed to accompany every thunderstorm, though generally invisible to the eye. When exceptionally severe, it would convey the idea of running fire, and would of course be very destructive of life. It is no wonder that most of the cattle which were left \"in the field\" died (Exodus 9:21, 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble. \"The accumulation of terms signifying Divine wrath is designed to set forth the dreadful nature of this last judgment\" (Hengstenberg) - the death of the firstborn. By sending evil angels among them. Most modern critics regard this clause as in apposition with the preceding one, and consider the \"wrath, indignation, and trouble\" to be themselves the \"evil angels\" spoken cf. Some, however, as Hengstenberg and Kay, interpret the passage of spiritual beings - not, however, of spirits of evil, who are never said to be ministers of God's wrath, but of good angels, who on this occasion were \"ministers of woe.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - He made a way to his anger; literally, he levelled a way for his anger; i.e. made a smooth path for it (Cheyne). He spared not their soul from death; rather, held not back their soul. But gave their life over to the pestilence. This is, undoubtedly, the true meaning, and not \"he gave their beasts over to the murrain.\" Though no \"pestilence\" is expressly mentioned in Exodus 12. as having caused the death of the firstborn, yet pestilence may assuredly have been the means employed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - And smote all the firstborn in Egypt (see Exodus 12:29). The chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham; or, \"the beginning (literally, firstfruits) of their strength\" (comp. Genesis 49:3). \"The tabernacles of Ham\" is a periphrasis for \"Egypt\" - the Egyptians, according to the author of Genesis (Genesis 10:6), being descendants of Ham (comp. Psalm 105:23, 27; 6:22). There are no sufficient grounds for connecting the name of Ham either with the Egyptian Kem, Kemi - the native name for the country - or with Khem, one of the principal Egyptian goes. The literation is, no doubt, close in the latter case; but etymologists lay it down that close approximations are especially deceptive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - But made his own people to go forth like sheep (comp. Psalm 77:20; Psalm 95:7). And guided them in the wilderness like a flock. The guidance began from Succoth, and was effected by means of the pillar of the cloud and the pillar of fire (see Exodus 13:20-22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - And he led them on safely, so that they feared not (comp. Exodus 14:13-22). At Pi-hahiroth they \"were sore afraid\" (Exodus 14:10), but after Moses had exhorted them (ver. 13), they showed no more signs of fear. But the sea overwhelmed their enemies (Exodus 14:26-31; Exodus 15:1, 4, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - And he brought them to the Border of his sanctuary. The \"sanctuary\" is here probably the Holy Land, as in Exodus 15:17; or we may translate גבוּל קדשׁו \"his holy territory.\" Even to this mountain. Mount Zion, on which the writer regards himself as standing while his words are chanted in the temple service. Which his right hand had purchased; or, had gotten, \"had won.\" God's right hand won the whole land for his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - He cast out the heathen also before them (comp. Exodus 34:24; Deuteronomy 7:1; 1 Kings 21:26: Psalm 44:2, etc.). \"They get not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but God's right hand, and his arm, and the light of his countenance\" (Psalm 44:3). And divided them an inheritance by line. The measuring line, which was employed in parcelling out territory, is intended (comp. Jeremiah 31:39; Amos 7:17). Joshua's division of the land (Joshua 15-19.) among the tribes is specially pointed at. And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents; i.e. in the tents of the heathen - the abodes of the Hivites, Hittites, Amorites, Porizzites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God (comp. above, ver. 17). The Israelites continued to \"tempt and provoke God\" after they had obtained possession of the Holy Land, and divided it among them (see Judges 2:11-19; Judges 3:12; Judges 4:1; Judges 6:1; Judges 10:6-15; Judges 13:1, etc.). And kept not his testimonies; or, his ordinances (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers (comp. ver. 8, end the comment ad loc.). They were turned aside like a deceitful bow (comp. Hosea 7:16). A \"deceitful bow\" is one that fails in the hour of need, either breaking, or losing its strength, or sending its arrows wide of the mark.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - For they provoked him to anger with their high places. The \"high place\" worship was always displeasing to God. It was, no doubt, deeply tinged with idolatry. And moved him to jealousy with their graven images. In the time of the Judges, both graven and molten images were employed by the Israelites in a worship which they nevertheless regarded as the worship of Jehovah (see the history of Micah in Judges 17. and 18, especially Judges 17:4, 13, and Judges 18:14, 17, 18, 31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 59. - When God heard this, he was wroth (comp. above, ver. 21). And greatly abhorred Israel. Not Israel, as distinct from Judah, but Israel in the broadest sense, the entire nation, as in ver. 55.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 60. - So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh. The \"tabernacle of the congregation\" was first set up under Joshua (Joshua 18.) at Shiloh, a city of Ephraim, and here the national sanctuary continued throughout the period of the Judges (Judges 18:31; Judges 21:19; 1 Samuel 1:3, 24; 1 Samuel 2:14; 1 Samuel 3:21; 1 Samuel 4:4, etc.). God was regarded as having \"forsaken\" this sanctuary, when he allowed the ark of the covenant, its chief treasure, to be taken (1 Samuel 4:11-22). Subsequently, but at what exact time is unknown, the tabernacle was removed from Shiloh to Nob (1 Samuel 21:1), and later on to Gibson (1 Kings 3:4). The tent which he pitched among men. (On the form and materials of the tabernacle, see Exodus 26:1-37, and compare Mr. Fergusson's article on the subject in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 3. pp. 1451-1455.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 61. - And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. God's \"strength\" and \"glory\" is the ark of the covenant (compare the expression in 1 Samuel 4:21, 22, \"The glory is departed from Israel\"). (For the capture and \"captivity\" of the ark, see 1 Samuel 4:17, and 5, 6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 62. - He gave his people over also unto the sword. Thirty thousand Israelites were slain in the battle in which the ark was captured (see 1 Samuel 4:10). And was wroth with his inheritance (comp. Psalm 28:9; Psalm 33:12; Psalm 106:5, 40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:63VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 63. - The fire consumed their young men. The reference is not to such passages as Leviticus 10:2; Numbers 11:1; Numbers 16:35, where a literal fire seems to be spoken of, but rather to the fire of war (Numbers 21:28; Isaiah 26:11; Jeremiah 48:45), or more generally to the fire of the Divine anger (Isaiah 10:16-18; Isaiah 47:14, etc.). And their maidens were not given to marriage; literally, were not praised in song; i.e. in the bridal song. The destruction of the young men, either in battle or in any other way, caused there to be more marriageable girls in Israel than there were husbands for (comp. Isaiah 4:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:64VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 64. - Their priests fell by the sword. As Hophni and Phinehas at the taking of the ark (1 Samuel 4:11), and, no doubt, many others on other occasions. And their widows made no lamentation. The solemn funeral dirge could not take place, since the bodies remained on the battlefield.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:65VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 65. - Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep (comp. Psalm 7:6; Psalm 35:23; Psalm 73:20). God is said to \"awake,\" when, after a time of inaction, he suddenly exerts his Almighty power, to the discomfiture of his enemies. That God never really slept was the profound conviction of the Israelites generally (see 2 Kings 18:27; Psalm 121:3, 4). And like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine (comp. Zechariah 10:7; Isaiah 42:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:66VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 66. - And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; rather, backward, so that they fled before him (comp. Psalm 40:14; Psalm 70:2, etc.). There is no allusion to 1 Samuel 5:6-12. The reference is rather to the many victories of Israel over the Philistines, which began under Samuel (1 Samuel 7:10), and continued under Saul and David. He put them to a perpetual reproach. Covered them, that is, with shame and disgrace. The shame culminated, perhaps, in David's victory over Goliath (1 Samuel 17:40-51).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:67VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 67. - Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph. The \"tabernacle of Joseph\" is the sanctuary at Shiloh, which was north of Bethel, and thus within the limits of the tribe of Ephraim. When a permanent site was to be assigned to the tabernacle and the ark, God did not choose for them the position of Shiloh, but that of Jerusalem. And chose not the tribe of Ephraim. Ephraim had enjoyed the pre-eminency from the time of the death of Moses (see the comment on ver. 9). By the course of events between Samuel's death and the establishment of the kingdom of David, the pre-eminency had been transferred to Judah, according to the design of the Almighty from the first (see Genesis 49:8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:68VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 68. - But chose the tribe of Judah. The choice was made when David was, by God's command, anointed to be king (1 Samuel 16:1-12). The Mount Zion which he loved (comp. Psalm 87:2, \"The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob\"). God, no doubt, inspired David with the thought of fixing his residence in \"the stronghold of Zion\" (2 Samuel 5:9), and of bringing up the ark of the covenant into it (2 Samuel 6:12-17). The presence of the ark determined the selection of Jerusalem for the site of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:69VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 69. - And he built his sanctuary like high palaces; rather, like the heights. The \"heights of heaven\" (Job 11:8; Job 22:12) are probably meant. Like the earth which he hath established forever; i.e. lofty as heaven, stable and firmly fixed as earth. The ultimate fate of the sanctuary is mercifully hidden from the psalmist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:70VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 70. - He chose David also his servant (see 1 Samuel 16:1, 12).

Isaiah 40:11). The Hebrew word translated \"ewes great with young\" really means \"ewes that are giving suck.\" This is the portion of the flock which needs the tenderest care. To feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance (see 1 Chronicles 11:2). As Peter, James, and John were called from their occupation of fishers to be \"fishers of men\" (Matthew 4:19), so David was called from feeding sheep to feed God's people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm78:72VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 72. - So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart. On the whole, David performed his task of governing Israel faithfully. He had the direct testimony of God to that effect (see 1 Kings 9:4). And he guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. David was not only an upright and faithful king, but also a \"skilful\" or prudent one. He built up his kingdom into an empire without suffering any serious disasters. Israel reached its acme of glory and prosperity under him, decline setting in under Solomon.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.79":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm79:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance (comp.

The Babylonians defiled the temple by breaking into it, seizing its treasures and ornaments (Jeremiah 52:17-23), and finally setting fire to it (Jeremiah 52:13). They have laid Jerusalem on heaps. This was certainly not done either by Shishak or by Antiochus Epiphanes; but was done, as prophesied (Jeremiah 9:11; Jeremiah 26:18; Micah 3:12), by the Babylonians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm79:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to Be meat unto the fowls of the heaven.

During the long siege (eighteen months) the number slain in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem would be very large. And there was none to bury them (compare the prophecy of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 14:16). The population being for the most part carried into captivity, and but few left in the land (Jeremiah 52:15, 16), the bodies of the slain lay unburied, the few left not being able to bury them.

The \"neighbours\" intended are the nations in the vicinity of the Holy Land - the Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, etc. Their attitude towards Israel under the circumstances may be gathered from what is related of the Edomites in Psalm 137:7. A scorn and derision to them that are round about us. It was not so much the \"reproaches\" of their enemies that vexed and grieved Israel, as the jeers and scoffs which they heard on every side (comp.

Exodus 5:2), as was the case with all the nations round about Canaan. And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name. Now that we are punished, go on to punish those who have persecuted us, and who are at least as guilty as ourselves. \"The prayer rests,\" as Hengstenberg remarks, \"upon what God does constantly.

The calamities suffered have not extinguished all faith or hope. God is still the God of Israel's salvation, i.e. the God from whom alone salvation can be obtained and may be expected. He is entreated to come to Israel's aid, not for their sakes, as they are wholly undeserving, but for his own glory (comp. Exodus 32:12; Numbers 14:13; Deuteronomy 9:28; and Exodus 32:27). And deliver us, and purge away our sins; literally, make atonement for our sins (Exodus 30:15); i.e. \"cancel them\" (Cheyne), or \"forgive them\" (Hengstenberg, Kay). For thy Name's sake (comp.

(so Joel 2:17). A triumph over a foreign nation was always regarded in the ancient world as a triumph over their gods. Their gods were bound to protect them, and, if they did not, must either have been absent or powerless (comp. 2 Kings 18:33-35; 2 Kings 19:12). Let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed; rather, let there be shown forth among the heathen in our sight vengeance for the blood of thy servants that has been shed; or, in other words, \"Let an evident judgment, visible to us, fall upon the heathen who have shed the blood of our brethren, thy true servants.\" An immediate judgment is prayed for; but it did not please God to send the judgment till after the expiration of a long term of years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm79:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; or, the groaning, as in Exodus 2:24. The Babylonians treated their Jewish captives variously. Some, like Daniel and the \"Three Children,\" were favoured, and exalted to high places. But the bulk of them were afflicted and oppressed (see Lamentations 1:3-5; Lamentations 5:18, etc.). But, whether well or ill treated, all sighed to return (comp. Psalm 137:1-6). According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; literally, that are children of death, which may have the meaning assigned to it in our version, or may simply signify, \"those whose death is imminent\" - who cannot live long now that they are torn from their country. The phrase recurs in Psalm 102:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm79:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

When David is most sorely pressed by persecution and danger, then is his faith and trust in God mast plainly apparent. Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me. The Revised Version has, \"from all them that pursue me;\" but \"persecute\" is better. Hengstenberg and Kay have, \"from all my persecutors.\" So also French and Skinner. The persecutors are such men as the Ziphites and others, who encouraged Saul in his attempts to take David's life (1 Samuel 26:1, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Lest he tear my soul like a lion (comp. Psalm 5:6, where there is a similar abrupt transition from the plural to the singular number). On both occasions David fears one special enemy - then probably Ahithophel, now Saul. The simile of the lion is one frequent in the Psalms (see Psalm 10:9; Psalm 17:12; Psalm 22:13, 21; Psalm 35:17; Psalm 54:4, etc.). Rending it in pieces. As the lion does a sheep. While there is none to deliver. No human helper, at once willing and able to give deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - O Lord my God, if I have done this; i.e. \"this which is laid to my charge.\" The general charge against David in Saul's lifetime was that he \"sought the king's hurt\" (1 Samuel 24:9). Afterwards he was accused of being \"a bloody man\" (2 Samuel 16:8) - the death of Ishbosheth, and perhaps of others, being regarded as his work. If there be iniquity in my hands. If, i.e., I have committed any criminal act, if any definite offence can be charged against me. Human weakness and imperfection David does not mean to deny, but, like Job, he maintains in a certain qualified sense his righteousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me. This is probably the true meaning. David denies that he has wantonly attacked and injured any one with whom he was on friendly and peaceable terms. No doubt he was accused of having estranged Saul by plotting to take the crown from him. (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy.) This translation, which is retained by our Revisers, has the support also of Ewald, Hupfeld, Mr. Aglen, and the 'Speaker's Commentary.' If accepted, it must be considered as a reference to 1 Samuel 24:7, or else to 1 Samuel 26:9, or both, and as a sort of parenthetic protest, \"Nay, not only have I not injured a friend, but I have gone so far as to let my enemy escape me.\" A different meaning is, however, given to the passage by many critics, as Rosenmuller, Hengstenberg, Bishop Horsley, Cheyne, etc., who regard the sense as running on without any parenthesis, and translate, \"If I have oppressed him who without cause is mine enemy.\" David, according to this view, denies that he has either injured a friend or requited evil to a foe.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.

To call on God to \"arise\" is to ask him to take action, to lay aside the neutral attitude in which he most commonly shows himself to man, and to interfere openly in the concerns of earth. To call on him to \"arise in his anger\" is to entreat him to vindicate our cause against those opposed in us, and to visit them with some open manifestation of his displeasure (comp. Psalm 3:7; Psalm 9:19; Psalm 10:12; Psalm 17:13; Psalm 44:26; Psalm 68:1). Lift up thyself. This is even a stronger expression than \"arise\" (Isaiah 33:10). It is a call on God to appear in his full strength. Because of the rage of mine enemies; or, against the rage of mine enemies (Kay, Revised Version). Force must be met by force. David justifies his appeal for aid by alleging the violence and fury of those whose attacks he has to meet. And awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded. The two clauses are not connected in the original, which runs, \"Awake for me: thou hast commanded judgment.\" The meaning seems to be, \"Arouse thyself on my behalf - judgment is a thing which thou hast ordained - surely now is the time for it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about.

For their sakes therefore return thou on high; rather, and above it (or, above them; i.e. above the congregation of the peoples) return thou on high.

Hitherto judgment has been prayed for, now it is announced, \"The Lord shall judge \" - shall decide between David and his enemies - shall judge them in his anger, and at the same time judge David, i.e. vindicate his cause. David has no desire to escape this judgment Judge me, he says, O Lord, according to my righteousness. Judge me, i.e., and, if thou findest me righteous, acquit me and vindicate me. And according to mine integrity that is in me; literally, which is on me (comp. Job 29:24, \"I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgment was as a robe and a diadem\"). Ver. 9: - Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end. It is not the removal of the wicked, but the removal of their wickedness, that David desires (comp. Psalm 10:15). But establish the just; i.e. protect strengthen, and sustain him. For the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins (comp. Jeremiah 11:20; Jeremiah 17:10; Jeremiah 20:12). \"The heart, as the seat of the understanding and the will, the reins of natural impulses and affections\" ('Speaker's Commentary').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - My defense is of God; literally, my shield is on God; i.e. \"rests on him\" (Kay) - is upheld by him.

So Rosenmuller, Bishop Horsley, Dr. Kay, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version. And God is angry with the wicked every day. There is no need of inserting the words, \"with the wicked,\" since, of course, it is with the wicked that God is angry. What the psalmist means to assert especially is that God's anger continues against the wicked as long as their wickedness continues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - If he turn not, he (i.e. God) will whet his sword (comp. Deuteronomy 32:41; Isaiah 27:1; Isaiah 34:5). \"Every new transgression,\" says Bishop Horne, \"sets a fresh edge to God's sword\" He hath bent his bow, and made it ready; rather, he hath bent his bow, and fixed it; i.e. held it in the position for taking aim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He hath prepared for him the instruments of death. These are probably not the sword and the bow, but the \"arrows\" of the next clause. They are prepared \"for him,\" i.e. for the wicked man. He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors; rather, he maketh his arrows to be fiery ones. Hengstenberg notes that \"in sieges it was customary to wrap inflammable matter round arrows, and to shoot them after it had been kindled\" (compare the, fiery darts\" of St. Paul, Ephesians 6:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood (comp.

The \"falsehood\" intended is probably the bringing of false charges against David (see vers. 3-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made (comp. Psalm 9:15, 16; Psalm 35:8; Psalm 57:6; Proverbs 26:27; Proverbs 28:10, etc.). There are several illustrations of this law of God's providence in Scripture, the most striking being that of Haman.

Some critics see in this a continuation of the metaphor, and suppose that, while the sinner is in the pit, the heap which his own hands have thrown out falls in upon him and crushes him. But it is perhaps better to understand the words in a more general way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness. Another abrupt transition - a song of thankfulness to Jehovah for giving the deliverance which the psalmist foresees, and considers as good as accomplished. And will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high (comp. Psalm 8:1, 9, \"How excellent is thy Name in all the earth!\"). God is identified with his Name very commonly in Scripture, or, perhaps we should say, the Name of God is used as a periphrasis for God himself. Where God puts his special presence, he is said to \"put his Name\" (Deuteronomy 12:5, 21: 1 Kings 14:21; 2 Chronicles 12:13). His Name is \"holy and reverend\" (Psalm 111:19); \"incense is offered unto it\" (Malachi 1:11); it is \"magnified for ever\" (1 Chronicles 17:24); for it the temple is built (1 Kings 8:44); through it the godly \"tread down their enemies\" (Psalm 44:5); the \"desire of men's souls is to it\" (Isaiah 26:8). (See also Psalm 92:1; Psalm 96:8; Psalm 99:3; Psalm 103:1; Psalm 105:1; Psalm 113:1; Psalm 115:1; Psalm 119:55; Psalm 145:1, 2, 21; Psalm 148:13; Psalm 149:3.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.80":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel. The title, \"Shepherd of Israel,\" is a new one; but it follows naturally from the metaphor, so often employed (Psalm 74:1; Psalm 77:20; Psalm 78:52; Psalm 79:13), of Israel being God's \"flock.\" Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock. \"Thou that leddest\" (Cheyne). The mention of \"Joseph\" shows at once that the thoughts of the psalmist are fixed on the northern kingdom. Thou that dwellest between the cherubims.

Hengstenberg suggests, and both Canon Cook and Professor Cheyne seem to accept the suggestion, that it was only a small portion of Benjamin which adhered to Judah at the division of the kingdoms, the greater part attaching itself to the rival power. Stir up thy strength; i.e. \"rouse thyself from thine inaction - come forward, and make thy might to appear.\" And come and save us; literally, come for salvation to us.

How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? literally, how long wilt thou smoke? (comp. Psalm 74:1). \"Against the prayer\" means \"in spite of the prayer,\" or \"notwithstanding the prayer.\" Ordinarily, God forgives, and ceases from his anger, as soon as the afflicted one makes earnest prayer to him. But this is not always so. A time comes when his wrath cannot be appeased - when \"there is no remedy\" (2 Chronicles 36:16).

And givest them tears to drink in great measure; or, and givest them to drink a copious draught of tears; literally, shalish is a measure of capacity, probably the third part of an ephah (see Isaiah 40:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours. A great invasion, Assyrian or Babylonian, was always a signal to the near neighbours of Israel - Syria, Moab, Ammon, Edom - to indulge in hostilities (see 2 Kings 24:2). And our enemies laugh among themselves (comp. Psalm 44:13; Psalm 79:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Turn us again, O Goal of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. Here the refrain occurs for the second time, but with the slight variation or \"O God of hosts\" instead of \"O God\" simply (see the comment on ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-19. - The poet, to excite God's compassion, proceeds to depict Israel as it was and as it is. He adopts the figure of a vine, perhaps suggested to him by the description of Joseph in the dying speech of Jacob (Genesis 49:22), and carries out his metaphor, in nine consecutive verses, with great beauty and consistency. Isaiah's description of Israel as a vineyard (Isaiah 5:1-7) is somewhat similar. Verse 8. - Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt. The history of Israel as a nation begins with the Exodus. The nation was transplanted from Egypt into a soil better fitted for it by the loving hand of God, in order that it might have ample room to grow up and develop itself freely. God \"brought it out of Egypt,\" not merely in the exercise of his ordinary providence over humanity, but by an active exertion of his Almighty power, and a long series of miraculous manifestations, without which the transfer could not have been effected. He then cast out the heathen, and planted it - drove out, that is, before Israel the seven nations of the Hivites, Hittites, Gergashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and Jebusites, and, having driven them out, \"planted\" in his own people (see Psalm 44:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou preparest room before it. The \"room\" was made by the removal of the heathen inhabitants, who were first greatly weakened by Rameses III., and then driven out by Joshua. And didst cause it to take deep root; rather, and it took deep root, as in the Revised Version. And it filled the land (comp. Deuteronomy 11:24; Joshua 1:3). Possession was taken of the whole land, not at once (Judges 1:27-36), but slowly and surely; the furthest limits being reached in David's time (1 Kings 4:21, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The hills were covered with the shadow of it. The \"hills\" intended are probably those of the south - the hill country of Judah - since the clauses which follow designate the boundaries towards the north, west, and east. (So Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Cheyne, and others.) And the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars; rather, and the goodly cedar trees were covered with their branches. The cedars of Lebanon are intended. They marked the boundary line on the north. The psalmist calls them \"cedars of God,\" by a strong, but not unprecedented (Psalm 36:6), hyperbole.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShe sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - She sent out her boughs unto the sea. The Mediterranean; the western boundary of the land. And her branches (or, her shoots, Revised Version) unto the river. The Euphrates (see Genesis 15:18; 1 Kings 4:21, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhy hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Why hast thou then broken down her hedges? or, her fences. Vineyards in the East were fenced round with walls (see Isaiah 5:5). So all they which pass by the way do pluck her; i.e. \"pluck off her grapes\" - ravage her and plunder her (comp. Psalm 89:40, 41).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The boar out of the wood doth waste it. The \"boar out of the wood,\" i.e. the wild boar - is probably Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings 15:29), or the Assyrian power generally. And the wild beast of the field doth devour it. Other beasts, i.e. other enemies of Israel, join in and share in the plundering (see above, ver. 6, and comp. Jeremiah 5:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReturn, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts; i.e. \"come back to us, to be our Helper and Defender.\" Look down from heaven, and behold. Condescend to \"look down\" upon us \"from heaven,\" thy dwelling place, and \"behold\" - take note of our condition, see how we suffer, and thou wilt be sure to visit this vine; i.e. to \"visit\" it, not in wrath, but in loving kindness and compassion - to \"visit it with thy salvation\" (Psalm 106:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted; rather, the stock. (So Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version.) Some, however, regard כַנָּה as a verb, and translate, \"Establish that which thy right hand has planted\" (see the LXX., Michaelis, Hupfeld, Canon Cook, and others). And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself; literally, the son, which may mean the offshoot (comp. Genesis 49:22). Is this offshoot Ephraim? or is the entire vine, all Israel, intended?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - It is burned with fire, it is cut down. The flames of war have begun to consume it - it is no longer a vine, but mere fuel (comp. Isaiah 33:12), ready to be burned. They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. Here the metaphor is dropped. The climax has been reached, and the matter is too serious for rhetorical treatment. The nation typified by the vine, the Israel of God, is perishing - perishing \"at the rebuke of God's countenance\" - because his favour is withdrawn from them. Unless God steps in to save, destruction is certain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand. Either upon Israel generally, or upon Ephraim - the northern kingdom - especially. A Judaean poet interceding for the rival state, is touching. Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself (comp. ver. 15 and the comment).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - So will not we go back from thee; i.e. \"we shall not go hack from thee any more.\" Gratitude for our deliverance will hind us fast to thy service. Quicken us (comp. Hosea 6:2). The prayer is for national rather than spiritual life - for a recovery from the destruction which has almost come upon them (ver. 16). And we will call upon thy Name; i.e. we will be faithful to thee henceforth; we will not go after other gods, but \"call upon\" thee, and thee only. The poet makes himself the spokesman of the whole nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm80:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall he saved. The psalm is closed by the refrain in its third and most perfect form. First we had, \"Turn us again, O God\" (ver. 3); then, \"Turn us again, O God of hosts\" (ver. 7); now, \"Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts\" - the appeal to God continually increasing in intensity. Having made his third appeal by the covenant Name, the psalmist seems to feel that he has done all that he can, and desists.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.81":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Sing aloud unto God our Strength. \"Loud\" singing is regarded as indicative of earnestness and sincerity (see 2 Chronicles 20:19; Nehemiah 12:42; Psalm 33:3; Psalm 98:4, etc.). (On God as Israel's \"Strength,\" see Psalm 27:1; Psalm 28:8; Psalm 46:1; Psalm 111:7.) Make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. The word translated \"make a joyful noise\" is especially used of the blare of trumpets (Leviticus 23:24; Numbers 29:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Take a psalm; or, lift up a song. And bring hither the timbrel; rather, strike the timbrel. The pleasant harp with the psaltery. The instruments ordinarily used in the service of the sanctuary were harps, psalteries, and cymbals (1 Chronicles 15:16; 1 Chronicles 16:5; 1 Chronicles 25:6; 2 Chronicles 5:12; 2 Chronicles 24:25; Nehemiah 12:27). Here the timbrel (תֹפ) seems to take the place of the cymbal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Blow up the trumpet in the new moon. There was a Mowing of trumpets at the beginning of every month (Numbers 10:10), in connection with the appointed sacrifices (Leviticus 28:11-15); so that the month intended cannot, so far, i.e. fixed. As, however, the chief blowing of trumpets was on the first day of the seventh month (Leviticus 23:24), most commentators regard the psalm as composed for this occasion. There are some, however, as Hengstenberg, Professor Cheyne, and Professor Alexander, who consider it to be a Passover psalm. In the time appointed; rather, at the full moon; i.e. on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the Feast of Tabernacles was opened (see Numbers 29:12). Trumpets were probably blown then also. On our solemn feast day. The Feast of Tabernacles is called κατ ἐξοχὴν, \"the feast,\" in many passages of the Old Testament (see Professor Cheyne's comment on this psalm, 'Book of Psalms,' p. 228).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob; rather, this is a law (Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). See the passages quoted in the preceding note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony. The special mention of \"Joseph\" here is strange. Professor Cheyne explains, \"God appointed the Law to be valid in northern as well as southern Israel.\" Hengstenberg and Professor Alexander account for the expression by the pre-eminence of Joseph during the sojourn in Egypt. When he went out through the land of Egypt. When he (Joseph) went out over (or, across) the land,\" i.e. at the time of the Exodus. Where I heard a language that I understood not. It can scarcely be supposed that this clause belongs properly to ver. 5. It is rather an introduction to the monody wherewith the psalm (as it has come down to us) concludes - the mournful complaint of God against his people. So Professor Cheyne, who translates, \"The discourse of no whom I had not known (i.e. of God) did I hear.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-16. - The \"discourse\" is now given. It commences somewhat abruptly, and is, perhaps, itself a fragment, the beginning of which is lost. God reminds Israel of his past favours (vers. 6, 7), exhorts them to faithfulness (vers. 8, 9), promises them blessings (ver. 10), complains of their waywardness (vers. 11, 12), and finally makes a last appeal to them to turn to him, and recover his protection, before it is too late (vers. 13-16). Verse 6. - I removed his shoulder from the burden. In Egypt, burdens were borne upon the shoulder, either simply held upon it with both hands, or distributed between the two shoulders by means of a yoke (see Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 214). His hands were delivered from the pots; rather, from the basket; i.e. the basket in which the clay was carried before it was made into bricks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.

The pillar of the cloud seems to be meant. In this, and from this, God answered the cry of his people (Exodus 14:24). I proved thee at the waters of Meribah (Exodus 17:7). The \"selah\" after these words marks a pause, during which the people addressed might reflect on the manifold mercies which God had vouchsafed to them in Egypt, in the wilderness, and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Hear, O my people (comp. vers. 11, 13). Israel is still \"God's people,\" however rebellious (vers. 11, 12). God has not yet given them up. And I will testify unto thee; or, \"protest unto thee\" (Kay, Cheyne). O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; or, \"if thou wouldst but hearken unto me!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god (comp; Exodus 20:3; Deuteronomy 5:7). Such worship had evidently begun, and required to be forbidden afresh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. The reminder was continually needed (see Exodus 20:2; Leviticus 26:13; Deuteronomy 5:6; Hosea 12:9; Hosea 13:4). Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it (comp. 2 Kings 13:19). God's gifts, both temporal and spiritual, are proportioned to our eager longing for them. As Christ could not do his miracles in one place because of their unbelief (Mark 6:5, 6), so God cannot give lavishly unless we desire largely.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But my people would not hearken to my voice (comp. Psalm 78:10, 41, 56; 2 Kings 17:14; 2 Chronicles 36:15, 16). And Israel would none of me; literally, would not obey me (see the Prayer book Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust. God's Spirit will not always strive with men (Genesis 6:3). After a time, if they persist in evil courses and disobedience to his commands, he \"gives them up,\" withdraws from them, leaves them to themselves, to the \"lust,\" or rather \"stubbornness\" of their own hearts - to their own perverse wills and imaginations. And they walked in their own counsels (comp. Jeremiah 7:24). This result is inevitable. If God no longer guides their thoughts and enlightens their understandings, they can but follow their own foolish counsels, and the result cannot but be disastrous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Oh that my people had hearkened unto me! rather, would hearken unto me!

And Israel had walked in my ways! rather would walk!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I should soon have subdued (rather, I should won subdue) their enemies. Israel is still surrounded by enemies, anxious for his destruction. God could subdue them and sweep them away in a moment, if he pleased; and would do so, if Israel would repent and return to him. The appeal is to the living Israel - the Israel of the psalmist's time, which is given one more chance of triumph over its enemies. And turned my hand against their adversaries. Logically, the two clauses should have been inverted, since the subjugation of Israel's enemies would be the effect of God's hand being turned against them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The haters of the Lord. Israel's enemies are always spoken of as God's enemies also (comp. Psalm 3:2, 7; Psalm 9:3; Psalm 68:1; Psalm 79:6, 7, etc.). They \"hate\" Jehovah (Psalm 21:8; Psalm 83:2), not merely as Israel's Protecter, but as the Source of all good, whereas they delight in evil. Should have submitted themselves unto him; rather, should submit themselves, or \"should yield feigned obedience\" (Authorized Version, margin). But their time (i.e. Israel's time) should have endured forever; rather, should endure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm81:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He should have fed them also; rather, he should feed. With the finest of the wheat; literally, with the fat of the wheat (comp. Deuteronomy 32:14 and Psalm 147:14). And with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee; rather, would I satisfy thee. The expression, \"honey out of the rock,\" is taken from Deuteronomy 32:13. It evidently means \"honey of the best\" - native honey, stored by the bees in clefts of the rocks. Of course, both the \"wheat\" and the \"honey\" are metaphors, which we are to regard as shadowing forth all temporal and spiritual blessings.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.82":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm82:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; or, \"in the congregation of God\" - \"the Divine assembly\" (see Job 1:6; Job 2:1; Isaiah 6:1, 2, etc.). El, in the singular, can scarcely mean the \"mighty ones of earth.\" He judgeth among the gods.

These commands are covert reproaches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm82:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Deliver the poor and needy. The poor were terribly oppressed, and needed \"deliverance\" (see Job 29:12; Isaiah 1:17; Isaiah 3:14, 15; Isaiah 58:6; Micah 3:2, 3).

Scarcely \"an aside from the indignant judge,\" as Professor Cheyne suggests, much less a remark interpolated by the poet (Ewald, Hitzig). Rather a complaint of human perversity, addressed by Jehovah to the angelic host who are present (ver. 1). It is not an accidental and excusable ignorance, but a wilful and guilty one that is spoken cf. They walk on in darkness. Loving darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil (John 3:19), they walked in the way of darkness (Proverbs 2:13). All the foundations of the earth are out of course; rather, are shaken. The fundamental bases on which the life of man upon the earth rests, the very principles of morality, are shaken, and totter to their fail, when those whose place it is to administer justice pervert it and deal out injustice instead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm82:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I have said, Ye are gods; i.e. \"in my Law I have called you gods\" - I have given you this lofty name (see Exodus 21:6; Exodus 22:8, 9), since ye judge on my behalf, \"as my representatives\" (Deuteronomy 1:17; 2 Chronicles 19:6; Romans 13:1, 2).

This was the general object of Israel's enemies at all times (2 Kings 24:2; 2 Chronicles 20:11; Psalm 138:7; 1 Macc. 3:35 1 Macc. 5:2), and thus does not help much towards determining the date of the occasion here spoken cf.

Edom was always among the bitterest of Israel's enemies, and naturally took a part in almost every combination that was made against them. Though sometimes subjugated (2 Samuel 8:14; 1 Kings 11:15, 16), it continued hostile during the whole period of Israelite and Jewish history. Hence the constant denunciations of the prophets (Isaiah 11:14; Jeremiah 27:3; Jeremiah 49:7-22; Ezekiel 25:12-14; Joel 3:19; Amos 9:12; Obadiah 1:6-18; Malachi 1:4). And the Ishmaelites. The Ishmaelites were the chief inhabitants of Northern Arabia (Genesis 25:13-18). They do not often appear among Israel's enemies. Of Moab. Moab, on the contrary, is a persistent adversary (see Numbers 22:6; Judges 3:12-30; 1 Samuel 14:47; 2 Samuel 8:2; 2 Kings 1:1; 2 Kings 3:4-27; 26:2; 2 Chronicles 20:1-10). And the Hagarenes. The \"Hagarenes,\" or \"Hagarites,\" are only mentioned here and in 1 Chronicles 5:10, 19-22. They were probably a branch of the Ishmaelites, named after Hagar, Ishmael's mother (Genesis 25:12). Their name occurs among those of Aramman tribes in the Assyrian inscriptions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Gebal. There is no reason to doubt that the Phoenician town of the name, mentioned in Ezekiel 27:9, and alluded to in Joshua 13:5 and 1 Kings 5:18, is meant. A southern Gebal, in the vicinity of Edom, is a fiction. Gebal was one of the most important of the Phoenician cities from the time of Shalmaneser II. (B.C. 828-810) to that of Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 635-560); see the author's 'History of Phoenicia,' p. 79. And Ammon. Ammon, like Moab, was a perpetual enemy of the Jewish people from their entrance into Palestine to the time of the Maccabees. And Amalek. The Amalekites, on the contrary, disappear from history from the time of their destruction by the Simeonites in the reign of Hezekiah (1 Chronicles 5:42, 43). The Philistines. Persistent enemies, like Edom, Moab, and Ammon (see I Macc. 5:66). With the inhabitants of Tyre. Tyre, in early times, was friendly to Israel (2 Samuel 5:11; 1 Kings 5:1-18; 1 Kings 9:26-28). and is not elsewhere mentioned as hostile until the reign of Uzziah (Amos 1:9). She rejoiced, however, when Jerusalem was destroyed (Ezekiel 26:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAssur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Assur also is joined with them. This is the climax. Assyria - the great empire - the most important of all the kingdoms of the earth - has joined the petty nations upon Israel's border, and holds a place in the great confederacy. From the historical books it would appear that this occurred but once, viz. in David's great war with the Ammonites and their allies (see the Introduction). They have holpen the children of Lot; i.e. the Moabites and Ammonites (comp. Genesis 19:37, 38; Deuteronomy 2:9, 19). Moab and Ammon would seem to have been the principal powers engaged in the confederacy. The others were their helpers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Do unto them as unto the Midianites. The allusion is probably to the discomfiture of the Midianites by Gideon (Judges 7:19-25; Judges 8:1-12). As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison (see Judges 4:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Which perished at Endor. \"Endor\" is not mentioned in the narrative of Judges; but it was certainly in the neighbourhood of Taanah and Megiddo, which are mentioned (Judges 5:19; see Joshua 17:11). They became as dung for the earth; i.e. their carcases manured the soil (comp. 2 Kings 9:37; Zephaniah 1:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb. \"Oreb\" and \"Zeeb,\" the leaders of the Midianitish host, were taken prisoners and slain by the Ephraimites who pursued after Midian (Judges 7:25). Yea, all their princes as Zeba, and as Zalmunna. Zeba and Zalmunna were the kings of Midian slain by Gideon himself (Judges 8:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession; rather, the homesteads of God; or \"the pastures of God\" (Psalm 23:2), i.e. of God's people, Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - O my God, make them like a wheel; rather, like whirling dust - the dust that is caught up by an eddy of wind, and twisted round and round (see Isaiah 17:13). As the stubble before the wind. Both the \"whirling dust\" and the \"stubble\" are images of what is lightest, most shifting, and of least account (see Job 13:25; Job 15:7; Job 21:18; Job 41:29; Isaiah 40:24; Isaiah 41:2; Jeremiah 13:24; Malachi 4:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire.

There is some confusion of metaphors; but the general meaning is clear. God is called upon to execute vengeance upon Israel's enemies by sweeping them away with the storm and tempest of his wrath (comp. Job 9:17; Isaiah 29:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Fill their faces with shame; i.e. cause their enterprise to fail, and so bring them to shame and confusion of face. That they may seek thy Name, O Lord. A merciful purpose lies behind the greater number of Divine visitations. They are intended to scourge men into submission, and cause them to turn to God. The psalmist, being in full sympathy with God, desires that his merciful intentions may have effect.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Lot them be confounded and troubled forever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish. An expansion of the thought contained in the first clause of the preceding verse, which must not be regarded as annulling the kind wish of the second clause. Like Hezekiah (Isaiah 37:20), the psalmist desires nothing so much as that \"all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Jehovah, and he only, is God,\" and may turn to him in sincerity and truth. It is for this end that he wishes them to be brought low, even to the verge of destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm83:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - That men may know; rather, that they may know. There is no \"men\" in the original. That thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth (see the comment on ver. 16).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.84":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - How amiable are thy tabernacles! or, \"how lovely are thy dwellings!!\" The plural is used, as in Psalm 43:3; Psalm 46:4 (also Korahite); and Psalms 132:7, either because the temple was made up of several compartments, or as a \"plural of dignity.\" O Lord of hosts (comp. vers. 3, 8, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord. These expressions do not imply that the writer is absent from the temple, but only that his delight in it is never satiated. My heart and my flesh; i.e. my whole nature. Crieth out for the living God; rather, rejoiceth; or \"sings out a note of joy\" unto the living God. So Hengstenberg, who says, \"The verb רִנֵּן is of frequent occurrence in the Psalms, and always signifies to rejoice.\" Compare the comment of Professor Cheyne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young. Both sparrows and swallows abound in Palestine. Canon Tristram found the nest of a sparrow \"so closely allied to our own that it is difficult to distinguish it,\" in a chink of the Haram wall at Jerusalem, near the Golden Gate ('Land of Israel,' p. 182). An anecdote related by Herodotus (1, 159) shows that sparrows built about the Greek temples. The general meaning of the figure in this place seems to be, \"If even birds love to build their nests, as they do, in the sacred precincts, how much more reason has the believing heart to find its home in the house of its God!\" But the psalmist thinks it enough to suggest the parallel, and does not stop to carry it out. Even thine altars. The \"altar\" is put, by metonymy, for the temple itself. O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God (comp. Psalm 5:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Blessed are they that dwell in thy house. As the Korahite Levites did, being \"keepers of the gates\" of the Lord's house (1 Chronicles 9:19; 1 Chronicles 26:1). They will be still praising thee. It is their privilege to be always praising thee. \"The speaker regards the temple as predominantly the house of praise\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee. God is the \"Strength\" of all who trust in him. The psalmist seems to mean that mere dwelling in the house of God is not enough for blessedness. Trust in God - having God for one's Strength - is also requisite (comp. ver. 12). In whose heart are the ways of them; literally, in whose heart are highways. The \"highways\" intended are probably those of holiness (comp. Proverbs 16:17 and Isaiah 35:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a wall; rather, through the valley of weeping (τὴν κοιλάδα τοῦ κλαυθμῶνος, LXX.). So Hupfeld. Hengstenberg, Kay, and the Revised Version; compare Hosea's \"valley of Achor,\" i.e. \"of Grief.\" When the righteous pass through a time of suffering or calamity, they turn it into a time of refreshment. The rain also filleth the pools; rather, the early rain (Joel 2:23) covereth it with blessings. The rain of God's grace mantles all the valley with a luxuriant vegetation; in other words, the blessing of God rests on those who act as above described, and causes them ever to increase in righteousness and true holiness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They go from strength to strength. Their spiritual course is one of continually greater vitality and vigour. Every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.

I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand; i.e. than any number of days elsewhere. It is difficult to trace any connection between these concluding verses. They appear to consist of distinct thoughts, which arise in the writer's mind, and are jotted down as they occur to him. One is a thought of loyalty, which finds vent in a prayer for the king (ver. 9). Another is a reflection of the main thought of the psalm, the incomparable blessedness of dwelling in God's house. A third (vers. 11, 12) is the joy and glory of perpetual communion with God and trust in God. See the remarks of Professor Cheyne ('The Book of Psalms,' p. 237). I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God; literally, at the threshold; but the meaning is well expressed by the Authorized Version. \"Doorkeepers in the house of their God\" was exactly what the Korahite Levites were (1 Chronicles 9:19; 1 Chronicles 26:1, 12-19). Than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. As their ancestor, Korah, had done (Numbers 16:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For the Lord God is a Sun and Shield; i.e. not only a \"Shield\" or protection, as he has been already called (ver. 9), but also a \"Sun,\" the source of life and light, of joy and happiness (comp. Isaiah 60:19, 20; Malachi 4:2). The Lord will give grace and glory. Inward grace, outward splendour and glory (Revelation 21:11-24). No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly (see 1 Corinthians 2:9; 1 Timothy 4:8; and Psalm 34:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm84:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee (comp.

God is thanked for two things especially:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) for having granted his people forgiveness of their sins (vers. 2, 3); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) for having, partially at any rate, removed his chastening hand from them, and given them a return of prosperity (ver. 1). Ver 1. - Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land; or, \"thou art become gracious\" (Kay, Cheyne) - a preceding time during which God was not gracious is implied (comp. Psalm 77:7-9). Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. It is most natural to understand this of the return from the Babylonian captivity; but possible that some lighter affliction may be intended, since שׁבות is used, metaphorically, for calamities short of actual captivity (see the comment on Job 42:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast covered all their sin. God's remission of punishment, and restoration of his people to favour, was a full indication that he had \"forgiven their iniquity\" and \"covered their sins.\" This was so vast a boon, that a pause for devout acknowledgment and silent adoration seemed fitting. Hence the \"selah,\" which is at the end of the second verse, not of the first, as Hengstenberg states.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou hast taken away all thy wrath. Forgiveness of sins implies the cessation of wrath, though it does not necessarily imply the cessation of punishment. Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger. This expresses the meaning better than the marginal rendering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - The prayer. Two things are prayed for - first, that God will turn the hearts of his people wholly towards himself (ver. 4); and secondly, that he will complete his work of deliverance by removing the traces, that still exist, of his past anger (vers. 5-7). Israel is still in a state of great distress and weakness, suffering from the natural consequences of its sins, which keep it depressed and sad. Verse 4. - Turn us, O God of our salvation. Thou art turned to us (ver. 1); let us also be turned to thee. We cannot turn of our own mere wish to turn; we need thy helping grace (comp. Psalm 80:3, 7, 19). And cause thine anger toward us to cease. Verbally, this contradicts ver. 3, whence it has been supposed by some to come from the mouth of another speaker. But really there is no contradiction, if we understand, both here and in the next verse, by God's anger, the effects of his anger, which were still continuing (comp. Ezra 3:12, 13; Ezra 4:4-24; Ezra 9:2-15; Nehemiah 1:3; Nehemiah 2:17; Nehemiah 4:1-22; Nehemiah 5:1-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Wilt thou be angry with us forever? This is equivalent to \"Wilt thou still go on punishing us?\" Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations? or, \"from generation to generation?\" This suits well the first period after the return from the Captivity, when the depressed condition of Israel continued for several generations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Wilt thou not revive us again! literally, wilt thou not return and revive us? (comp. Psalm 71:20). So Ezra prays God to \"give Israel a little reviving in their bondage\" (Ezra 9:8). That thy people may rejoice in thee. The \"revival\" and \"rejoicing\" came in Nehemiah's time, when the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem was kept \"with gladness, both with thanksgiving, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps\" (Nehemiah 12:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.

The psalmist anticipates a favourable answer to his prayer, and proceeds to note down the chief points of it. God will \"speak peace to his people\" (ver. 8), bring his salvation near to them (ver. 9), contrive a way by which \"mercy and truth,\" \"righteousness and peace,\" shall be reconciled (vers. 10, 11), shower blessings on his land (ver. 12), and guide his people in the way marked out by his own footsteps (ver. 13). Verse 8. - I will hear what God the Lord will speak; i.e. \"I will wait now and hear the Divine answer to my prayers\" (comp. Habakkuk 3:1, \"I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me\"). For he will speak peace unto his people. He will give them a gentle answer - one breathing peace and loving kindness. And to his saints. And especially he will so answer the elite of his people - the khasidim, \"his saints,\" or \"loving ones.\" But let them not turn again to folly (comp. Ezra 9:10-14). If, after the deliverance that they had experienced, they turned again to such \"folly\" as had brought on their misfortunes, it would make their end worse than their beginning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSurely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; or, will be nigh. The answer to the prayer in ver. 7. That glory may dwell in our land. Professor Chevne asks, \"What glory?\" and suggests, \"The true Shechinah, the manifested presence of Israel's God.\" But it may be doubtful whether anything more is meant than a return of earthly glory and prosperity, such as that for which Nehemiah laboured and prayed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Mercy and truth are met together. God's mercy and God's truth are reconciled and brought into harmony. The psalmist does not say - probably does not know - how, He accepts the fact of the reconciliation, which is revealed to him (ver. 8) by faith, and boldly announces it. The explanation was reserved for the coming and teaching of Christ. Righteousness and peace have kissed each other. \"Righteousness\" and \"peace\" are synonymous with \"mercy\" and \"truth.\" Here they are personified - \"represented as angels in human form\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTruth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Truth shall spring out of the earth (comp. Isaiah 45:8). One result of the reconciliation of God's mercy and truth shall be a growth of righteousness among men. The pardoned people of God shall bring forth much fruit. And righteousness shall look down from heaven. God's righteousness \"looks down from heaven\" (like the sun), to draw up and mature the feeble plant of man's righteousness, which, without it, would come to nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; i.e. shower blessings on his laud, both spiritual and temporal. And our land shall yield her increase. Other crops may be included, but the special reference is to a large increase of good works.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm85:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRighteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Righteousness shall go before him. Prepare the way, i.e., for the restoration of the people to God's favour (compare the first clause of ver. 11, and the second of ver. 12). And shall set us in the way of his steps; i.e. cause his people to walk in the way marked out by his footsteps - i.e. by the indications of his will either in nature or in the written Word.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.86":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - Prayer, the predominant note of the entire psalm, holds almost exclusive possession of the first strophe, only passing into praise when the last verse is reached, where the petitioner reminds God of his loving kindness and readiness to forgive. Verse 1. - Bow down thine ear, O Lord, hear me (comp. Psalm 31:2; Proverbs 22:17). For I am poor and needy; or, \"I am afflicted and in misery.\" Poverty in the ordinary sense is scarcely intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPreserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Preserve my soul. It is one of the special offices of God to \"preserve the souls of his saints\" (Psalm 97:10). He is not only man's Creator, but his \"Preserver\" (Job 7:20; Job 10:12). For I am holy. The psalmist does not mean to claim for himself perfect holiness, but only that sincerity in religion which God's servants may rightly vindicate to themselves. O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee (comp, Psalm 34:22; Psalm 37:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Be merciful unto me, O Lord; for I cry unto thee daily; rather, all day long (Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Rejoice the soul of thy servant. The prayer rises from mere entreaties for relief and recovery from a state of suffering, into an earnest request for that which the heart of man is ever longing for and seeking after - gladness and joy. The faithful are promised that they shall come ultimately to a condition of exceeding great joy; but even saints are sometimes impatient, and want their joy in this world and at once. For unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul (comp. Psalm 25:1, entitled, like this, \"a Psalm of David\"). There is no more likely way of attaining to spiritual joy than to be always lifting up the soul to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive. The word translated \"ready to forgive,\" סַלָח, occurs here only; but the context sufficiently fixes its meaning, which is well expressed by the ἐπιεικὴς of the LXX. As God was \"good\" and \"forgiving,\" he would be likely to grant the petitions just addressed to him. And plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee (comp. Exodus 34:6; Joel 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-10. - In this second strophe praise is predominant. Prayer occupies two verses only (vers. 6, 7); in the other three (vers. 8-10) God is magnified and glorified. Verse 6. - Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer. An echo of ver. 1. The psalmist begins, as it were, afresh, calling God's attention to himself, as if he had not yet spoken. And attend to the voice of my supplications (comp. Psalm 17:1; Psalm 55:2; Psalm 61:1, etc.). That God's ear is always attent to the prayers of his people does not make it superfluous for them to entreat his attention.

The nature of the trouble is not distinctly stated; but it appears to have been caused by domestic rather than foreign enemies. For thou wilt answer me (comp. ver. 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAmong the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord (see the Song of Moses, Exodus 15:11). The imaginary gods of the heathen - not, perhaps, known to the psalmist to be wholly imaginary - are probably meant (comp. Psalm 77:19; Psalm 89:6; Psalm 95:3). Neither are there any works like unto thy works. So in Deuteronomy 3:24, \"What god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works?\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord (comp. Psalm 72:11, 17; Psalm 82:8, etc.). Since God had made all nations (Acts 17:26), it was safe to conclude that they would all one day worship him. The prophecy, however, still remains unfulfilled. And shall glorify thy Name. Either with their lips, or in their lives, or in both ways. Compare the anticipations of Isaiah (Isaiah 66:23), Zephaniah (Zephaniah 2:10), and Zechariah (Zechariah 14:9, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For thou art great, and doest wondrous things. The\" greatness\" of God, in reality most clearly manifested by the facts of his ordinary providence, seems to men in general, as it seemed to this psalmist, especially indicated by the \"wonders,\" or \"miracles\" - נפלאות - which he wrought (comp. Exodus 15:11; Psalm 72:18; Psalm 77:14). Thou art God alone (see 2 Kings 19:15; Isaiah 37:16; Isaiah 44:6, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTeach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-17. - The third strophe is almost equally divided between prayer and praise, vers. 11, 16, and 17 being devoted to the one; and vers. 12, 13, and 15 to the other. Ver. 14 is of the nature of a complaint. Verse 11. - Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth (comp. Psalm 25:4; Psalm 27:11; Psalm 119:33). Man cannot know \"the way of the Lord,\" unless he is taught of God. The inward anointing of the Spirit is needful to teach us what God would really have us do (1 John 2:27). It is only when we are thus taught that we can \"walk in his truth.\" Unite my heart to fear thy Name. So Symmachus, who has ἕνωσον; Canon Cook, Dr. Kay, Hupfeld, Professor Alexander, and the Revised Version. Hengstenberg prefers \"incline my heart;\" and Professor Cheyne would alter the text into accordance with the LXX., Αὐφρανθήτω ἡ καρδία μου, \"Make my heart to rejoice.\" But the textual reading has the weight of authority in its favour, and gives an excellent sense, \"Bring all my heart into unison, that it may be wholly fixed on thee.\" Compare the following verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart; i.e. \"with an undivided heart.\" And I will glorify thy Name (see ver. 9) forevermore. A belief in immortality is implied, if not formally asserted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For great is thy mercy toward me (see ver. 5). And thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. The actual deliverance was from death (ver. 14); but death involved descent into Hades, so that those who were delivered from the one were at the same time delivered from the other. The expression translated \"the lowest hell\" means no more than \"Hades which is beneath the earth.\" No comparison is made of one part of Hades with another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - O God, the proud are risen against me (comp. Psalm 119:51, 69, 85, 122; and also Psalm 54:3). And the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; rather, a crew of violent ones have sought after my soul, or \"plotted against my life\" (comp. Psalm 7:1, 2; Psalm 17:13; Psalm 35:3, 4, etc.). And have not set thee before them; i.e. \"have given no thought to God, or how he would act, whether he would allow their wickedness or prevent it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion. The appeal is to God's own revelation of himself. He had declared that he was \"merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin\" (Exodus 34:6, 7); he could not, therefore, desert the psalmist in his need. And gracious, long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth (comp. above, ver. 5; and see also Numbers 14:18; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Oh turn unto me, and have mercy upon me. God had for a time turned his face away from his servant; now he is entreated to turn it towards him, and, as a consequence, to \"have mercy upon him\" and deliver him. Give thy strength unto thy servant. Only in God's strength can we effectually contend against either our spiritual or our temporal foes. If, however, we ask him for strength, his strength will be \"sufficient for us\" (2 Corinthians 12:9). And save the son of thine handmaid. Either \"the son of one who was specially religious,\" like the mother of Timothy (2 Timothy 1:5). or\" the son of an Israelitish mother,\" therefore born and bred up in thy household.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm86:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Show me a token for good; i.e. give me some sign - not necessarily a miraculous one - that thou art dealing with me, not for evil, but \"for good\" (Jeremiah 24:6), and that thou wilt grant me that which I have requested of thee. That they which hate me may see it. A visible token is therefore requested, not a mere inward conviction or assurance (see 2 Kings 20:8; Isaiah 7:11). And be ashamed (comp. Psalm 6:10; 56:17; 119:78, etc.). Because thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me. The psalmist's deliverance would be his enemies' shame; it would show that God was on his side, and against them.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.87":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm87:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> His foundation is in the holy mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - The praises of Zion.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) She is built upon the holy mountains;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) God loves her pre-eminently; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) a glorious future is assigned to her in the counsels of God.

He will cause the Gentiles to flock into his Church, even those who have been hitherto the most bitter enemies of Israel (ver. 4), and will place these strangers on a par with such as have belonged to his Church from their birth (vers. 4, 5, 6), admitting them to every blessing and every privilege. The Church, thus augmented, shall be taken under his own protection, and \"established,\" or placed on a sure footing, forever. Compare our Lord's promise to St. Peter,\" On this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\" (Matthew 16:18). Verse 4. - I will make mention of Rahab; i.e. of Egypt. The context requires this meaning, which is found also in Psalm 89:10 and in Isaiah 51:9. Literally \"Rahab\" means \"pride, arrogance.\" And Babylon. The fitting counterpart of Egypt, equally antagonistic to Israel, and equally lifted up with pride and presumption. To them that know me; rather, among them that know me; i.e. as belonging to them, included in their number (comp. Isaiah 19:21, \"And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day;\" and see also Psalm 72:11, 17; Psalm 82:8; Isaiah 66:23). Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia. Other hostile nations (comp. Psalm 83:7; 2 Chronicles 12:3; 2 Chronicles 14:9-13). This man was horn there. There is no \"man\" in the original, and it is better to understand \"nation;\" this, that, and the other nation - all those mentioned, and others - are grafted into Zion, and have a second birth there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm87:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her. A repetition, but emphatic, and perhaps intended to assert of individuals what in the preceding verse was said of nations.

The Church is \"established\" on a Rock, forever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm87:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.

(On dancing as an element of religious service, see Exodus 15:20; 2 Samuel 6:16; Psalm 68:25; Psalm 149:3; Psalm 150:4.) The psalmist intends to represent the converted nations as coming in a grand procession, with songs and dances, to celebrate their admission to Zion, and there one and all exclaiming, All my fresh springs - i.e. \"all my sources of life, and joy, and happiness\" - are in thee. The verse is possibly but \"fragment,\" as Professor Cheyne supposes.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.88":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O Lord God of my salvation. This is the one \"word of trust,\" which some get rid of by an emendation. But the Septuagint supports the existing Hebrew text; and it is in harmony with the rest of Scripture. The saints of God never despair. I have cried day and night before thee; literally, by day have I cried - by night before thee; a trembling, gasping utterance (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry (comp.

Like the slain that lie in the grave. Like those who are thrown into a pit dug on a battlefield, among whom there are often some who have not breathed their last (see the Prayerbook Version). Whom thou rememberest no more. We have already beard the complaint that in death there is no remembrance of God on the part of man (Psalm 6:5); now we have the converse statement, that neither is there then any remembrance of man on the part of God. The psalmist speaks, not absolute truth, but the belief of his day - a belief which vanished when life and immortality were brought to light by the gospel. And they are out off from thy hand; i.e. severed from thee, shut up in a place where thou dwell eat not (see Job 10:21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit. The affliction whereof the psalmist complains has come direct from the hand of Cod. It is some severe stroke of illness which has brought him to his last gasp. The \"lowest pit\" is here metaphorical - the deepest depth of calamity. In darkness; literally, in darknesses, where no ray of thy favour shines upon me. In the deeps (comp. Psalm 69:2, \"deep waters, where the floods overflow him\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves.

And thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves (comp. Psalm 42:7, \"All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me. Compare the similar complaint of Job (Job 19:13, 14); and see also Psalm 31:11; and infra, ver. 18. Thou hast made me an abomination unto them. So Job (Job 9:31; Job 19:19; Job 30:10). It may be suspected that the psalmist's affliction was of a kind which made him \"unclean.\" I am shut up. Not in prison, as Jeremiah (Jeremiah 32:2; Jeremiah 33:1; Jeremiah 36:5), but probably as unclean, or as suspected of Being unclean (see Leviticus 13:4-33). And I cannot come forth. I am not allowed to quit my chamber.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction; or, \"mine eye hath grown feeble\" (comp. Job 17:7). Lord, I have called daily upon thee; or, \"all day.\" I have stretched out my hands unto thee. The attitude of earnest prayer (comp.

Shall the dead arise and praise thee? rather, the shades (rephaim); comp. Job 26:5. The word rephaim designates the wan, shadowy ghosts that have gone down to Hades (Sheol), and are resting there. Shall these suddenly rise up and engage in the worship and praise of God? The psalmist does not, any more than Job (Job 14:14), expect such a resurrection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave? Wilt thou wait till I am in my grave before thou showest any mercy upon me? or, Will not that be too late? Can thy faithfulness to thy promises be shown in destruction? literally, in Abaddon; i.e. \"perdition\" - a name of Sheol (cf. Job 26:6; Job 28:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? (compare above, ver. 10). And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? \"The land of forgetfulness,\" or \"of oblivion,\" is another name for Hades, or Sheol - not that there are supposed to be no memories of the past in it (Isaiah 14:16, 17), but that all is faint and shadowy there, consciousness but a half-consciousness, remembrance but a half-remembrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But unto thee have I cried, O Lord; literally, but as for me, to thee have I cried. The psalmist returns from the somewhat vague speculations of vers. 10-12 to fact and to himself. He is not yet a mere shade, an inhabitant of Sheol; he is in the flesh, upon the earth; he can still cry, and does still cry, to Jehovah. There is thus still a faint gleam of hope for him. And in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee. The psalmist will draw out God's mercy, as it were, before its time, by importuning him with early and continual prayer (comp. vers. 1, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Lord, why cutest thou off my soul? The psalmist speaks here, like Job, as one aggrieved. What has he done to be \"cast off\"? He is evidently not aware of having sinned any grievous sin, and does not understand why he is visited with such grievous sufferings. Why hidest thou thy face from me? Perhaps it is his insensibility, his unconsciousness of real sins and shortcomings, that has drawn down upon the psalmist his chastisement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up. This is a new point. The psalmist's afflictions have not come upon him recently. He does not merely mean, as some have supposed, that, like other men, as soon as he was born he began to die, but speaks of something, if not absolutely peculiar to himself, yet at any rate rare and abnormal - a long continuance in a dying state, such as could only have been brought about by some terribly severe malady. While I suffer thy terrors I am distracted; literally, I have endured thy terrors; I am exhausted. (On the endurance of God's \"terrors,\" see Job 6:4; Job 9:34; Job 13:21.) The natural result would be a state, not of distraction, but of exhaustion. (So Kay, and substantially Professor Cheyne.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thy fierce wrath goeth over me. \"Overwhelms me;\" i.e. \"like a fiery flood\" (see above, ver. 7). Thy terrors have cut me off. A different word is used for \"terrors\" from that which occurs in ver. 15, and one elsewhere occurring only in Job 6:4. The verb also is one characteristic of Job (Job 6:17; 23:17), and means \"extinguish,\" or \"exterminate.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - They came round about me daily like water.

They compassed me about together; or, \"they compass me about in a mass.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm88:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Lover and friend hast thou put far from me (comp. ver. 8 and Job 19:13).

They strike the keynote, which is, first, praise of God's faithfulness generally (vers. 1, 2), and secondly, praise of him in respect of the Davidical covenant (vers. 3, 4). Verse 1. - I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever. \"Forever\" is the emphatic phrase. The psalmist will commemorate God's mercies, not only when they are continuing, but always. With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations; literally, to generation and generation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For I have said, Mercy shall be built up forever. A time shall come when, out of whatever ruins, mercy shall be \"built up\" - raised from the ground like a solid edifice, and, when once raised up, shall stand firm forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens. At the same time, God's faithfulness to his promises will be established \"in the very heavens,\" i.e. conspicuously (see ver. 37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I have made a covenant with my chosen. There is an ellipse of \"for thou hast said,\" which Professor Cheyne supplies. God's promise to David is the entire foundation of the psalmist's hope and confidence. He therefore places it briefly in the very forefront - afterwards expanding it into the beautiful passage, which forms more than one-third of the entire composition (vers. 19-37). I have sworn unto David my servant (comp. 2 Samuel 7:11-16; Psalm 132:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thy seed will I establish forever (see 2 Samuel 7:12, 13; Psalm 130:12). And build up thy throne to all generations. The promises to David were not fulfilled in the letter. After Zerubbabel, no prince of the Davidic house sat on the throne of David, or had temporal sway over Israel. The descendants of David sank into obscurity, and so remained for five centuries. Still, however, God's faithfulness was sure. In Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, the true King of the everlasting kingdom was raised up - every pledge made to David was fulfilled. \"Messiah the Prince,\" eternal King of an eternal kingdom, appeared as the true \"Seed' intended, and began his spiritual reign over the spiritual Israel, which still continues, and will continue forever.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-37. - The psalmist carries out the intention proclaimed in ver. 1, and proceeds to \"sing of the mercies of the Lord\" at great length. His song of praise divides into two portions. From ver. 5 to ver. 18 it is a general laudation of the Almighty for his greatness in heaven (vers. 5-7), in nature (vers. 9, 11, 12), and in the course of his rule on earth (vers. 10, 13-18), after which it passes into a laudation of him in respect of what he had done, and what he had promised, to David (vers. 19-37). Verse 5. - And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord. \"The heavens\" here are not the material heavens, as in Psalm 19. l, but the company of the dwellers in heaven. God's praise fittingly begins with them. Thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. The \"congregation of the saints\" is the company of angels (comp. Job 5:1; Job 15:15). Not on earth only (vers. 1, 2), but in heaven also God's \"faithfulness\" is the theme of song.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord?

Or to thy faithfulness round about thee! rather, as in the Revised Version, and thy faithfulness is round about thee. It has been said that \"the two words 'mercies' and 'faithfulness' are the refrain of the psalm.\" The latter occurs six times (vers. 1, 2, 5, 8, 24, 33), and \"faithful\" in ver. 37.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou rulest the raging of the sea. There is no reason why this should not be understood literally. God's power over the sea is constantly put forward by the sacred writers as very specially indicative of his might and greatness (comp. Job 38:8-11; Psalm 107:29; Proverbs 8:29; Jeremiah 5:22, etc.). When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them (comp. Psalm 65:7; Psalm 107:23-30; Matthew 8:26, 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces; or, \"thou didst break\" once upon a time, i.e. at the Exodus. (For the designation of Egypt under the term \"Rahab,\" i.e. \"arrogant,\" see Job 9:13; Job 26:12; Psalm 87:4; Isaiah 51:9.) As one that is slain; i.e. completely, utterly. Thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm (see Exodus 14:27-31; Exodus 15:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The heavens are thine (comp. Psalm 8:3; Psalm 33:6; Psalm 115:16). The earth also is thine (see Psalm 24:1). As for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them (see Psalm 50:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The north and the south then hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy Name. As in ver. 11 \"heaven and earth\" stand for all creation, the whole of the material universe, so here the four points of the compass designate the same. Tabor and Herman undoubtedly represent the west and the east. They present themselves to the poet's mind as standing over against each other, one on this side, and the other on that side, of Jordan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou hast a mighty arm; literally, an arm with might. Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. These anthropomorphisms will disturb no one; they pervade the whole of Scripture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJustice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14 - Justice and judgment; or, righteousness and justice (Cheyne). The psalmist here rises to a higher level - from that of might to that of right. God is not merely strong to do whatever he wills; but all that he wills is consonant with right and justice. Are the habitation of thy throne; rather, the basis, or \"foundation.\" (So Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version.) Mercy and truth shall go before thy face; i.e. shall stand ever in front of thee; be thy inseparable companions. Whatever thou doest shall be done \"in truth and equity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound. The sound of devotional joy appears to be intended - the sound which went up from the sanctuary in the great festival times (see Numbers 10:1, 9; Leviticus 25:9; Psalm 27:6; Psalm 81:1, etc.). They shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance. Herein consists especially their blessedness (comp. Psalm 4:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16 - In thy Name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. The \"Name\" and the \"righteousness\" of God form the glory of the Church, and are a perpetual source of rejoicing to her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For thou art the Glory of their strength; or, \"the Ornament\" - that in which their strength and might as a people culminate. And in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. Thy favour towards us exalts us among the nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For the Lord is our Defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our King; literally, for to Jehovah belongs our shield, and to the Holy One of Israel belongs our king. The meaning seems to be that he who is Israel's king and shield - i.e., the Davidical monarch at the time - being under the constant protection of the Almighty, all must necessarily go well with the people at last.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Then thou spakest; rather, once, or \"once upon a time,\" as Professor Cheyne suggests. The allusion is to the occurrence related in 2 Samuel 7:4-17. In vision (see 2 Samuel 7:7). To thy holy one; i.e. to Nathan the prophet. And saidst. The psalmist reports the words of the vision very freely, interweaving with them thoughts drawn from various psalms; expanding them, and sometimes heightening the colours. I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people (comp. 1 Samuel 16:1-13). David was \"mighty\" from his youth - own before he slew Goliath, as appears from his slaughter of the lion and the bear (1 Samuel 17:34-36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I have found David my servant (comp. 1 Samuel 16:1; Acts 13:22). With my holy oil have I anointed him (see 1 Samuel 16:13)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - With whom my hand shall be established; i.e. \"to whom I will give continual support\" (see 1 Samuel 18:12, 14; 2 Samuel 5.]0; 7:9). Mine arm also shall strengthen him (comp. ver. 13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him (see 2 Samuel 7:10, which has supplied the very words of the second clause).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him (comp. 2 Samuel 7:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him (comp. Psalm 61:7). And in my Name shall his horn be exalted (see 2 Samuel 7:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers (comp. Psalm 72:8). \"The sea\" is probably the Mediterranean, and \"the rivers\" the Euphrates, with its canals and affluents (see 1 Kings 4:21, 24; Psalm 137:1). The promise of an extended dominion is implied in 2 Samuel 7:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father (comp. 2 Samuel 7:14). My God, and the Rock of my salvation (see 2 Samuel 22:2, 3, 47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Also I will make him my firstborn. There is but one true \"Firstborn\" - \"the Only Begotten of the Father.\" All other so called \"firstborns\" - as Israel (Exodus 4:22), Ephraim (Jeremiah 31:9), David - are reflections or representatives, in some way or other, of the real and only true \"Firstborn.\" Higher than the kings of the earth; literally, the most high above the kings of the earth; i.e. standing to the other \"kings of the earth\" as \"the Most High\" to his angelic ministers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - My mercy will I keep for him for evermore (comp. 2 Samuel 7:15, \"My mercy shall not depart away from him\"). And my covenant shall stand fast with him (see 2 Samuel 7:16; 2 Samuel 23:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - His seed also will I make to endure forever (comp. 2 Samuel 7:16, \"Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before me\"). And his throne as the days of heaven. \"Thy throne shall be established forever;\" \"I will establish his kingdom\" (2 Samuel 7:12, 16)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - If his children forsake my Law, and walk not in my judgments (comp. 2 Samuel 7:14, \"If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men\"). Solomon himself began the falling away (1 Kings 11:1-8). He was followed by Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 12:1), Ahaziah (2 Kings 8:27), Joash (2 Chronicles 24:17-24), Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:16-20), Ahaz (2 Kings 16:2-18), Manasseh (2 Kings 21:2-16), Amon (2 Kings 21:20-22), Jehoahaz (2 Kings 23:32), Jehoiakim (2 Kings 23:37), Jehoiachin (2 Kings 24:9), and Zedekiah (2 Kings 24:19), all of whom \"did evil in the sight of the Lord\" - forsook his Law, and walked not in has judgments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; rather, if they profane my statutes; i.e. make light of them, either in their words or in their lives.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Then will I visit their transgressions with the rod (comp. 2 Samuel 7:14). \"The rod\" was used upon Solomon (1 Kings 11:14-40), Rehoboam (1 Kings 12:16-20), Ahaziah (2 Kings 9:27), Joash (2 Kings 12:17-20), and all the wicked descendants of David, as sufficiently appears from the history of the divided kingdom in Kings and Chronicles. God visited their iniquity with stripes time after time, and generation after generation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. Compare the original promise (2 Samuel 7:15); and see also 1 Kings 11:12, 13, 34-39; 1 Kings 15:4, 5, etc. The seed of David was not allowed to fail, but was continued on, until, in the fulness of time, there was born into the world, of David's seed and in David's city, One in whom all the promises made to David could be, and were, accomplished in their utmost fulness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips (comp. ver. 28, and the comment ad loc.). With God is \"no variableness, neither shadow of turning\" (James 1:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnce have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Ones have I sworn by my holiness; rather, one thing have I sworn. (On God's oath to David, see vers. 3, 49, and Psalm 132:11.) The present passage shows that it was sworn \"by his holiness\" - i.e. by his absolute moral perfection. That I will not lie unto David; i.e. that I will keep all my promises to him. God, no doubt, always and in every case \"keepeth his promise forever\" (Psalm 146:6); but in his mercy and loving kindness he condescended to give David a special guarantee of his faithfulness in respect of the promises made to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - His seed shall endure forever (comp. ver. 29). And his throne as the sun before me; i.e. shall endure as the sun (comp. Psalm 72:5 and 2 Samuel 7:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - It shall be established forever as the moon (comp. Psalm 72:7). And as a faithful witness in heaven. Some understand this expression of the moon; but, as Professor Cheyne comments, \"Who could witness (or declare) that such great things were true but Jehovah?\" (So too Delitzsch, Kay, and Canon Cook.) If this be regarded as the true meaning, it will be better to translate, \"the true witness.\" Job's citation of God as his witness (Job 16:19) is scarcely parallel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38-45. - A sudden and complete change here sets in. Rejoicing is turned into mourning, eulogy into complaint. Notwithstanding all the promises of God, notwithstanding his inherent and essential \"faithfulness,\" the Davidical king and his kingdom are at the last gasp. Seemingly, every promise made has been broken, every hope held out of good turned into an actuality of evil. God is wroth with his anointed, has made void the covenant with him, profaned his crown and cast it to the ground, turned the edge of his sword, and made him not to stand in the battle; he has laid his land open to the enemy, broken down its defenses, brought its strongholds to ruin, given it as a spoil to all who pass by; he has set up the right hand of Israel's adversaries, caused them to rejoice and triumph in Israel's disgrace and suffering; he has covered the king with shame, and cut short the days of his youth. How is this? And what is to be the end of it? Verse 38. - But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. The first \"thou\" is emphatic - אתּה, THOU, \"the faithful Witness;\" THOU, who hast made all these promises, art the very One who has falsified them all - who hast \"been wroth with thine anointed,\" abhorred (or rejected) him, and cast him off:NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant; or, \"abhorred\" (Cheyne, Revised Version). The verb is a very unusual one, occurring only here and in Lamentations 2:7. Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground (comp. Psalm 74:7). The theocratic crown was so holy a thing, that any degradation of it might be regarded as a \"profanation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Thou hast broken down all his hedges; i.e. \"all his defences\" - the strongholds, that guarded the frontiers of the land, were brought to ruin (comp. 2 Chronicles 11:5-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - All that pass by the way spoil him. This feature of the situation recalls 2 Kings 24:2, but might, no doubt, suit also other times of distress. He is a reproach to his neighbours; or, \"he is become a reproach\" (comp. Nehemiah 1:3; Nehemiah 2:17; Psalm 44:13; Psalm 79:4, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; i.e.\" thou hast increased their power and strength, exalted them, and depressed him.\" Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice (comp. Psalm 35:15, \"In mine adversity they rejoiced;\" and see also Micah 7:8; Obadiah 1:10-12). Every depression of Israel caused the neighbouring nations, who alike feared them and detested them, to rejoice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword; literally, the rock of his sword. It is not quite clear whether a \"blunting of the sword,\" or a \"turning to flight of those who drew the sword,\" is intended. In either ease the phrase implies military disaster. And hast not made him to stand in the battle; i.e. '\" hast caused him to give way before his enemies.\" The words imply defeat in the open field.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Thou hast made his glory to cease; literally, thou hast put an end to his brightness; but the meaning is that given in the text. And cast his throne down to the ground (comp. ver. 39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - The days of his youth hast thou shortened. This does not seem to mean an actual cutting short by death (since the Davidical king has been spoken of as alive in vers. 38, 41, 43), but rather a cutting short of youthful energy and vigour, a premature senescence, such as may well have fallen upon Jehoiachin or Zedekiah. Thou hast covered him with shame; or, \"heaped shame upon him\" - \"covered him up with shame.\" The phrase would suit Jehoiachin, who was kept in prison by Nebuchadnezzar, and in \"prison garments\" (2 Kings 25:29), for the space of thirty-five years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 46-51. - The psalm ends with an appeal to God - \"How long\" is the present state of things to continue? How long is God's wrath to endure? Will he not remember how weak and futile, how short-lived and fleeting, the whole race of man is? Well he not bethink him of his old loving kindnesses to David, and of the promises made to him, and confirmed by oath? Will he not therefore remove their reproach from Israel, and especially from his anointed, on whom the disgrace chiefly falls? To these questions there can be but one answer. God will assuredly make his faithfulness known (see ver. 1). Verse 46. - How long, Lord? wilt thou hide thyself forever; (comp. Psalm 13:1; Psalm 74:10; Psalm 79:5). Shall thy wrath burn like fire? i.e. furiously, without cessation, till all be consumed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - Remember how short my time is. Consider how short-lived is the whole race of men. Come, therefore, to our deliverance quickly. Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? literally, for what vanity thou hast made all the sons of men. Another point suggested for God's consideration, as fitted to call forth his compassion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? An expansion of the first clause of ver. 47. Man's littleness, feebleness, and fleetingness should draw forth the pity and loving kindness of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - Lord, where are thy former loving kindnesses? or, \"thy ancient mercies,\" those \"sure mercies of David,\" whereof Isaiah spoke (ch. Iv. 3). Which thou swarest unto David in thy truth (comp. ver. 35 and Psalm 132:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; i.e. the reproach under which all thy people lie so long as their enemies are allowed to plunder and oppress them at their pleasure (see vers. 40-44). Remember also how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people. The reproach under which his countrymen lie - a reproach laid on them by \"all the mighty people among whom they dwell - falls on the psalmist's heart with especial weight through his deep sympathy with all of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. The reproach which rests upon the people rests no less upon their king - upon his \"footsteps,\" his movements, all that he does, \"every step he takes\" (Bishop Perowne). This is an additional affliction to the psalmist, and emphasizes his last cry to God for mercy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm89:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - Blessed be the Lord forevermore. Amen, and Amen. This detached verse, not necessarily from the same hand as the rest of the psalm, winds up, with the usual refrain, the Third Book.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O Lord our Lord. In the original, Jehovah Adoneynu; i.e. \"Jehovah, who art our sovereign Lord and Master.\" As David is here the mouthpiece of humanity, praising God for mercies common to all men, he uses the plural pronoun instead of the singular one. How excellent is thy Name in all the earth! or, \"How glorious is thy Name!\" (Kay, Cheyne). Who hast set thy glory above the heavens. It is difficult to obtain this sense from the present Hebrew text; but some corruption of the text is suspected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Out of the month of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength. By \"babes and sucklings\" are meant young children just able to lisp God's praises, and often doing so, either through pious teaching or by a sort of natural instinct, since \"Heaven lies about us in our infancy\" (Wordsworth). These scarce articulate mutterings form a foundation on which the glory of God in part rests. Because of thine enemies. To put them to shame, who, having attained to manhood, refuse to acknowledge God. That thou mightset still the enemy and the avenger. It scarcely seems as if any single individual - either Absalom, or Ahithophel, or even Satan (Kay) - is intended. Rather the words are used generally of all those who are enemies of God, and desirous of revenging themselves upon him. The existence of such persons is well shown by Hengstenberg.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When I consider thy heavens (comp. Psalm 19:1; Psalm 33:6; Psalm 104:2). David, in his shepherd-life, had had abundant opportunity of \"considering the heavens,\" and had evidently scanned them with the eye of a poet and an intense admirer of nature. It is probably in remembrance of the nights when he watched his father's flock, that he makes no mention of the sun, but only of \"the moon and the stars.\" The work of thy fingers; and therefore \"thy heavens.\" Often as the \"hand of God\" is mentioned in Scripture, it is but very rarely that we hear of his \"finger\" or \"fingers.\" So far as I am aware, the only places are Exodus 8:19; Exodus 31:18; Deuteronomy 9:10; and Luke 11:20. The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained (comp. Genesis 1:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - What is man, that thou art mindful of him? In comparison with the lofty heavens, the radiant moon, and the hosts of sparkling stars, man seems to the psalmist wholly unworthy of God's attention. He is not, like Job, impatient of God's constant observation (Job 7:17-20), but simply filled with wonder at his marvellous condescension (comp. Psalm 144:3). And the son of man, that thou visitest him? The \"son of man\" here is a mere variant for \"man\" in the preceding hemistich. The clause merely emphasizes the general idea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels; rather, thou hast made him but a little lower than God (אלהים). There is no place in the Old Testament where Elohim means \"angels;\" and, though the LXX. so translate in the present passage, and the rendering has passed from them into the New Testament (Hebrews 2:7), it cannot be regarded as critically correct. The psalmist, in considering how man has been favoured by God, goes back in thought to his creation, and remembers the words of Genesis 1:26, 27, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness... So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him\" (compare the still stronger expression in Psalm 82:6, \"I have said, Ye are gods\"). And hast crowned him with glory and honour; i.e. \"and, by so doing, by giving him a nature but a little short of the Divine, hast put on him a crown of glory such as thou hast given to no other creature.\" There is a point of view from which the nature of man transcends that of angels, sinceNEWLINENEWLINE(1) it is a direct transcript of the Divine (Genesis 1:27); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it is the nature which the Son of God assumed (Hebrews 2:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. An evident reference to Genesis 1:28, \"Have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.\" By these words man's right of dominion was established. His actual dominion only came, and still comes, by degrees. Thou hast put all things under his feet (comp. 1 Corinthians 15:25-28; Hebrews 2:8). In their fulness, the words are only true of the God-Man, Jesus Christ (Matthew 28:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - All sheep and oxen; literally, flocks and oxen, all of them. The domesticated animals are placed first, as most completely under man's actual dominion. Yea, and the beasts of the field; i.e. \"and all other land animals\" (comp. Genesis 1:28; Genesis 9:2). If some were still unsubdued (2 Kings 17:25, 26; Job 40:24; Job 41:1-10), their subjugation was only a question of time (see Isaiah 11:6-9; Isaiah 65:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas; literally, fowl of the air, and fishes of the sea, the passer through the paths of the seas. Every passer through the paths of the seas, whether exactly a fish or no. The cetacea are thus included (comp. Genesis 1:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the earth! The psalmist ends as he began, with excellent poetic effect, and in a spirit of intense piety. Some think that he saw in vision the complete subjugation of the whole earth to man in such sort as will only be accomplished in the \"new heavens and new earth,\" in which Christ shall reign visibly over his people. But his words are not beyond those which are natural to one of warm poetic temperament and deep natural piety, looking out upon the world and upon man as they existed in his day. Inspiration, of which we know so little, may perhaps have guided him to the choice of words and phrases peculiarly applicable to \"the Ideal of man's nature and true Representative, Christ;\" and hence the many references to this psalm in the New Testament (Matthew 21:16; 1 Corinthians 15:25-28; Hebrews 2:6-8), and in this sense the psalm may be Messianic; but it is certainly not one of those, like Psalm 2. and Psalm 22, where the author consciously spoke of another time than his own, and of a Personage whom he knew only by faith. (For other examples of the recurrence at the end of a psalm of the idea wherewith it commenced, see Psalm 20:1-9; Psalm 46:1-11; Psalm 70:1-5; Psalm 103:1-22; Psalm 118:1-29; and the \"Hallelujah psalms:\" Psalm 106:1-48; Psalm 113:1-9; Psalm 117:1, 2; Psalm 125:1-21; 146-150.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.90":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Lord, thou hast been our Dwelling place in all generations; or, \"our habitation\" (see Psalm 91:9); comp.

Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world; literally, or thou gavest birth to the earth and the world (comp. Deuteronomy 32:18). Even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God (comp.

Genesis 3:19). And sayest, Return, ye children of men; i.e. \"return once more, and replenish the earth.\" There may be an allusion to the destruction of mankind by the Deluge, and the repeopling of the earth by the descendants of Noah, as Dr. Kay supposes; or the meaning may be that God is continually bringing one generation of men to an end. and then setting up another, having the same control over human life that he has over inanimate nature (ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday. Time has no relation to God; it does not exist for him. \"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day\" (2 Peter 3:8) Therefore we must not judge his methods of working by our own. When it is past; rather, as it passes. And as a watch in the night. To the sleeper a night watch seems gone in a moment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5 - Thou carriest them away as with a flood. This verse is to be connected with ver. 3, \"Thou sweepest mankind away;\" i.e. removest them from the earth, when it pleases thee. They are as a sleep. Fantastic, vague, forgotten as soon as it is over. In the morning they are like grass which groweth up (comp. Psalm 37:2; Psalm 72:16; Psalm 92:7; Psalm 103:15; Isaiah 40:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withered (comp.

From the general reflections, and the general consideration of human weakness, which have hitherto occupied him, the psalmist proceeds to speak particularly of the weakness and sin of himself and his own people, which have brought upon them a painful visitation. God's anger is hot upon them, and has \"consumed\" them - not utterly, but so that they are greatly \"troubled\" and cast down. By thy wrath are we troubled. The expressions used suit the time of the later wanderings in the wilderness, when the generation that had especially sinned was being gradually \"consumed,\" that it might not eater the Holy land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thou hast set our iniquities before thee. Instead of hiding his face from their iniquities, turning away from them and overlooking them, God has placed them steadily \"before him,\" in the full searching and scorching light of his own purity and holiness. And not only has he done this with the sins which they know of, and whereof their consciences are afraid; but he has set their secret sins also in the light of his countenance. (On man's \"secret sins,\" comp. Psalm 19:12, and the comment ad loc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For all our days are passed away in thy wrath; or, \"under thy wrath\" - \"whilst thou art still angry with us\" (comp. Deuteronomy 32:15-25). We spend our years - rather, bring our years to an end (Hengstenberg, Kay, Revised Version) as a tale that is told; rather, as a reverie, or \"as a murmur.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The days of our years are three score years and ten. This seems a low estimate for the time of Moses, since he himself died at the ago of a hundred and twenty (Deuteronomy 34:7), Aaron at the age of a hundred and twenty-three (Numbers 33:39), and Miriam at an age which was even more advanced (Numbers 20:1; comp. Exodus 2:4). But these may have been exceptional cases, and we have certainly no sufficient data for determining what was the average length of human life in the later period of the wanderings. The suggestion has been made that it was probably even shorter than that here mentioned. And if by reason of strength they be four score years; i.e. \"if, through exceptional strength in this or that individual, they occasionally mount up to four score years.\" Yet is their strength labour and sorrow; rather, yet is their pride then but let, our and vanity. They may boast of their age; but what real advantage is it to them? After seventy, the years draw nigh when each man is forced to say, \"I have no pleasure in them\" (Ecclesiastes 12:1). For it is soon cut off, and we fly away. Moreover, even if we live to eighty, our life seems to us no more than a span, so soon does it pass away, and we take our departure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11 - Who knoweth the power of thins anger? Who can duly estimate the intensity of God's anger against such as have displeased him? Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath; rather, or who can estimate thy fury as the fear of thee (i.e. the proper fear) requires? The verse is exegetical of ver. 9, and is intended to impress on man the terribleness of God's anger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - From complaint the psalmist, in conclusion, turns to prayer - prayer for his people rather than for himself. His petitions are,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that God will enable his people to take to heart the lessons which the brevity of life should teach (ver. 12);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that he will cease from his anger, and relent concerning them (ver. 13);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that he will once more shower his mercies upon them, and cause their affliction to be swallowed up in gladness (vers. 14, 15);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) that he will show his glorious doings to them and to their children (ver. 16);NEWLINENEWLINE(5) that he will let his beauty rest upon them (ver. 17); andNEWLINENEWLINE(6) that he will bless their doings, and establish them (ver. 17). Verse 12. - So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. \"Teach us,\" that is, \"so to reflect on the brevity of life, that we may get to ourselves a heart of wisdom,\" or a heart that is wise and understanding.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReturn, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Return, O Lord, how long? rather, turn, O Lord; i.e. \"turn from thy anger - how long will it be ere thou turnest?\" And let it repent thee concerning thy servants. God \"is not a man, that he should repent\" (Numbers 23:19); and yet from time to time \"it repents him concerning his servants\" (Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14). He relents, that is, from his fierce anger, allows himself to be appeased, and has compassion upon those who have provoked him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Oh satisfy us early with thy mercy; literally, satisfy us in the morning with thy mercy; i.e. \"after a night of trouble, give us a bright morning of peace and rest.\" That we may rejoice and be glad all our days; rather, and we will rejoice and be glad, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMake us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us.

And the years wherein we have seen evil; or, \"suffered adversity.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Let thy work appear ante thy servants, end thy glory unto their children. The \"work\" and the \"glory\" are the same thing - some vast exertion of the Divine power and majesty, which will result in great good to his people. If we accept the Mosaic authorship of the psalm, the establishment of Israel in the laud of Canaan may reasonably be taken as the \"work\" spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm90:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us (comp. Psalm 45:24, \"Thou art fairer than the children of men;\" Psalm 27:4, \"To behold the beauty of the Lord;\" Isaiah 33:17, \"Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty\"). The \"beauty of God\" is upon us when we see and realize the loveliness of his character. And establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. The repetition adds nothing, except it be emphasis. God is asked, finally, to \"establish the work\" in which his servants are engaged - to bless it; that is, to advance it and prosper it. The nature of the \"work\" is not mentioned.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.91":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High (comp.

He who has his thoughts always on God is said to \"dwell in him\" - to \"make his abode with him\" - to \"sit down in his secret place.\" He has the Almighty, as it were, for his constant companion. Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. This is not \"tautology.\" What is meant is that \"loving faith on man's part shall be met by faithful love on God's part\" (Kay).

Psalm 124:7; Proverbs 6:5); and, secondly, from the noisome pestilence (comp. ver. 6), i.e. from all dangers whatsoever - not more from these than from others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He shall cover thee with his feathers; rather, with his pinions (see the Revised Version; comp. ver. 1; and see Exodus 19:4; Deuteronomy 32:11). And under his wings shalt thou trust; rather, shalt thou take refuge. His truth - i.e. \"his faithfulness, his fidelity\" - shall be thy shield and buckler; i.e. \"thy protection.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night. Robbers constituted the chief \"terror by night\" (see Job 24:14-16; Jeremiah 49:9; Obadiah 1:5); but night attacks on the part of a foreign enemy were not uncommon (Song of Solomon 3:8; Isaiah 15:1). Nor for the arrow that fleth by day. Open war is probably intended, not sirocco, or pestilence, or \"the arrows of the Almighty\" (Job 6:4). The man who trusts in God will be specially protected in the peril of battle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness. The plague god is personified and represented as stalking through the land in the hours of darkness. Parallels have been found in the literature of the Babylonians (see 'Babylonian and Oriental Record,' vol. 1, p. 12) and elsewhere. Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. The rare word, קטב, translated \"destruction\" here and in Deuteronomy 32:24, is rendered by the LXX. διαμόνιον, and the entire phrase, \"for the destruction that wasteth at noonday\" becomes ἀπὸ συμπτώματος καὶ δαιμονίου μεσημβρινοῦ - \"from ruin and the demon of the midday\" - by which sunstroke would seem to be meant (comp.

So Israel in the land of Goshen \"looked on,\" and saw the calamities of the Egyptians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my Refuge, even the Most High, thy Habitation; literally, for thou, O Lord, art my Refuge; thou hast made the Most High thy Dwelling place, which can scarcely be made to yield a tolerable sense. It is supposed that a word - אָמַרְתָּ- has dropped out, and that the verse originally ran thus: \"Because thou hast said, Jehovah is my Refuge, and hast made the Most High thy Dwelling place\" (comp. vers. l, 2). The second speaker for a second time addresses the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

His very \"dwelling\" is to be protected so that his family may suffer no hurt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways (comp. Psalm 34:7). The faithful are under the constant care of angels (Hebrews 1:14), who guide them and direct them perpetually. Satan made a crafty use of this promise when he tempted our Lord (Matthew 4:6; Luke 4:10, 11). No doubt it applies to him pre-eminently, as the specially \"Faithful One.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They shall bear thee up in their hands; rather, upon their hands - lifting thee over difficulties and stumbling blocks. Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone (comp. Proverbs 3:23, 24). Moral impediments are, no doubt, chiefly meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder. Conquered enemies prostrated themselves before their conquerors, who, to mark the completeness of the subjection, placed a foot upon the prostrate form. From this practice the metaphor of \"treading under foot\" for conquering became a commonplace (see Psalm 7:5; Psalm 44:5; Psalm 55:12, etc.). The \"lion\" here represents all open and violent foes; the \"adder,\" all secret and malignant ones. The young lion (kephir, the lion in the height of his strength) and the dragon (tannin, the most dreadful form of serpent) shalt thou trample under feet. An emphatic repetition, with a certain heightening of the colour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Because he hath set his love upon me (see Deuteronomy 7:7; Deuteronomy 10:15). \"By a sudden and effective transition,\" as Professor Cheyne remarks, \"Jehovah becomes the speaker\" of the concluding strophe. It is not enough that the faithful should encourage each other by their anticipations of God's coming mercies, God himself now speaks by the mouth of his prophet, and makes promises in his own Person. I will deliver him. A ratification of vers. 3, 7, 10-15. I will set him on high; i.e. \"exalt him above his fellows\" - \"bring him to honour.\" Because he hath known my Name. \"Knowing God's Name\" is nearly equivalent to knowing him. It implies, besides knowledge, faith and trust in the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - He shall call upon me, and I will answer him. This is equivalent to, \"Whenever he calls upon me, I will answer him,\" or \"I will grant all his prayers.\" I will be with him in trouble (comp. Psalm 46:1). I will deliver him (see above, ver. 14). And honour him; or, \"bring him to honour\" (compare \"I will set him on high,\" in the preceding verse).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm91:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWith long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - With long life (or, length of days) will I satisfy him. Length of days is always viewed in the Old Testament as a blessing, and a special reward for obedience (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; 2 Kings 20:6; 2 Chronicles 1:11; Psalm 21:4; Proverbs 3:2, 16, etc.). It is only in the New Testament that we learn how much \"better\" it is \"to depart, and be with Christ\" (Philippians 1:23). And show him my salvation (comp. Psalm 50:23); i.e. \"make him experience what salvation is.\" \"Salvation,\" as Professor Cheyne observes, \"is both an act and a state\" - an act on God's part, a state on man's.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.92":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART> It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord (comp.

Israel's Lord, Jehovah, is also \"the Most High over all the earth\" (Psalm 83:18), and should at all times be thought of as both.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - To show forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. The suitableness of worship every morning and evening has been almost universally felt. The Mosaic Law provided for it by the establishment of the morning and evening sacrifice (Exodus 29:38, 39), with the accompanying ritual. Jewish piety added a noonday prayer (Psalm 55:17; Daniel 6:10), and Christian zeal established the \"seven hours of prayer.\" Morning and evening still, however, remain, by common acknowledgment, the most appropriate times for worship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery. Some think that only one instrument is intended here, and translate, \"Upon an instrument of ten strings, even upon the psaltery\" (or, \"the lute\"). (On the character of the psaltery, see the comment on Psalm 33:2.) Upon the harp with a solemn sound. The reference is clearly to the public service of the temple, since in the private devotions of the faithful instruments were not likely to be used.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work. It is difficult to say what \"work\" is intended. Some have supposed \"the work of creation,\" as the psalm is one \"for the sabbath\" (see title); but perhaps the general \"working\" of God's providence in the world is more probable. (So Hengstenberg, Kay, and Cheyne.) I will triumph in the works of thy hands. A repetition for the sake of emphasis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - O Lord, how great are thy works!

The difficulty is that which disturbed Job (Job 21:7-21) and Asaph (Psalm 73:2-15), viz. the prosperity of the wicked. The present writer, however, is not disturbed - he sees in their prosperous condition nothing but a prelude to their overthrow. And when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; or, \"do blossom.\" It is that they shall be destroyed forever; literally, it is for their destruction forever (comp.

Whatever else is uncertain, this at least is sure, that ultimately God's enemies will perish. The repetition adds the greatest force to the passage. All the workers of iniquity (comp. ver. 7) shall be scattered. All of them - every one (comp. Matthew 7:23, \"Depart from me, ye that work iniquity\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn; rather, of a wild ox. The Hebrew, like the Assyrian, reym, is certainly a species of wild cattle, whether the aurochs, or the bison, or the buffalo, may be doubted. The psalmist speaks in the name of Israel, or of God's faithful ones generally, and confidently predicts their exaltation to glory and honour simultaneously with the destruction of God's enemies. I shall be anointed with fresh oil. Oil was supposed to give vigour to the frame; and \"fresh oil,\" or \"green oil,\" would be the most efficient and the best.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies (comp. Psalm 54:7; Psalm 59:10). The \"desire\" is probably that expressed in Psalm 91:13. And mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. This is an unusual phrase, but sufficiently intelligible. Triumph over enemies is perceived both by the eye and by the ear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree. To an Oriental the palm is the queen of trees. \"Of all vegetable forms,\" says Humboldt, \"the palm is that to which the prize of beauty has been assigned by the concurrent voice of nations in all ages\" ('Aspects of Nature,' vol. 2. p. 20, Engl. trans.). Its stately growth, and graceful form, its perpetual verdure, its lovely and luxuriant fruit, together with its manifold uses (Strabo, 16:1, § 14), give it precedence over all other vegetable growths in the eyes that are accustomed to rest upon it. It is rather remarkable that, in the Old Testament, it is used as a figure for beauty only here and in Song of Solomon 7:7. Man, in his most flourishing growth, is ordinarily compared either to the cedar (2 Kings 14:9; Song of Solomon 5:15; Ezekiel 31:3-9; Amos 2:9, etc.)or the olive tree (Judges 9:8, 9; Psalm 52:8; Jeremiah 11:16; Hosea 14:6, etc.). He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon (see, besides the passages already quoted, 2 Kings 19:23; 2 Chronicles 2:8; Jeremiah 22:23; Zechariah 11:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThose that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Those that be planted in the house of the Lord; rather, Planted (or, Being planted) in the house of the Lord, they. This does not refer to the \"trees\" of the preceding verse, but to the \"righteous,\" who are viewed as passing their days almost continually in the temple courts, and so as (in a certain sense) \"planted\" there. The passage has no bearing on the question whether the temple courts were or were not planted with trees. Shall flourish in the courts of our God (comp. Psalm 84:2, 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; i.e. \"even when they are old, they shall still bring forth fruit\" - they shall still glorify God by their good works. They shall be fat and fiourishing; literally, fat and green. The metaphor of ver. 12 is still kept up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm92:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - To show that the Lord is upright. The happy and flourishing old age of the righteous (ver. 14; comp. Psalm 91:16) is a strong indication of God's faithfulness and truth, showing, as its does, that he keeps his promises, and never forsakes those that put their trust in him (comp. Psalm 27:10; Psalm 37:25; Isaiah 41:17, etc.). He is my Rock - rather, that he is my Rock - and that there is no unrighteousness in him. Both clauses depend on the \"show\" of the preceding hemistich.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.93":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm93:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord reigneth; rather, is become King (ἐβασίλευσεν, LXX.); comp. Psalm 10:16; Psalm 47:6; Psalm 96:10; Psalm 97:1, etc. God is regarded as having for a time laid aside, or hidden, his sovereignty, but as now at length coming forward and inaugurating the theocracy. The writer may have in his mind some recent manifestation of Divine power, or he may be anticipating the final establishment of the reign of Messiah. He is clothed with majesty; or, \"he hath robed himself in majesty\" (Cheyne). The Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself; literally, the Lord is clothed, he hath girded himself, with strength (comp. \"Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord,\" Isaiah 51:9). The world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. When God \"takes his kingdom,\" he firmly establishes his sway over the earth, with its inhabitants, in such sort that \"it cannot be moved\" - it can suffer no violent agitation or disturbance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm93:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thy throne is established of old. Though God from time to time comes forward, as it were, and asserts his sovereignty, yet it is no new rule that he sets up. He has always been the King both of heaven and earth. Thou art from everlasting. Not merely from \"of old,\" but from all eternity (comp.

By \"the floods\" seem to be meant the world powers, God's enemies; perhaps especially Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon. Invading hosts are constantly compared to \"floods\" or \"rivers\" in Scripture (see Isaiah 8:7, 8; Isaiah 28:2; Isaiah 17:12, 13; Isaiah 59:19; Jeremiah 46:8, etc.). The floods lift up their waves; or, \"their din,\" \"their roaring\" (comp. Psalm 65:7, \"Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm93:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord on high (comp. Psalm 92:8) is mightier than the noise of many waters; literally, than the voices of many waters (comp. ver. 3). As the waters represent angry nations, the poet speaks not only of their \"noise,\" but of their \"voices.\" Yea, than the mighty waves of the sea; or, \"the glorious breakers of ocean\" (so Kay; and comp. Exodus 15:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm93:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thy testimonies are very sure. God's \"testimonies\" are his commandments, considered as witnesses to man of his nature and his will respecting them. They are \"very sure,\" i.e. firm and unalterable, partaking of his unchangeability (James 1:17). Holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, forever. \"Holiness\" here seems to mean \"sanctity,\" \"inviolability\" (Kay, Cheyne; comp. 1 Samuel 6:20; Isaiah 6:13). This is a tacit appeal to God to keep his temple free from all profanation and pollution in the future. The psalmist does not really ask that it shall continue inviolate \"forever,\" but \"to length of days,\" i.e. for an ample period.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.94":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - The cry for vengeance. Israel is suffering oppression - not, however, from foreign enemies, but from domestic tyrants (vers. 4-6). Innocent blood is shed; the widow and the orphan are trodden down. God, it is supposed, will not see or will not regard (ver. 7). The psalmist, therefore, cries out to God to manifest himself by taking signal vengeance on the evil doers (vers. 1, 2). Verse 1. - O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth (comp. Deuteronomy 32:35, \"To me belongeth vengeance and recompence;\" and Jeremiah 51:56, where God is called \"the Lord God of reeompences,\" as he is here - literally - \"the Lord God of vengeances\"). O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself; or, \"shine forth\" - make thy justice to appear; show thyself in thy character of a God who will by no means clear the guilty (Exodus 34:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Lift up thyself (comp. Psalm 7:6; Isaiah 33:10). \"Rouse thyself,\" that is, \"from thy state of inaction\" - come and visit the earth as Judge. Thou Judge of the earth (comp. Genesis 18:25; Psalm 58:11). Render a reward to the proud; rather, render a recompense - as the same phrase is translated in Lamentations 3:64.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? \"How long?\" is the continual cry of the psalmists to God, as it is of the souls under the altar (Revelation 6:10; comp. above, Psalm 6:3; Psalm 13:1, 2; Psalm 35:7; Psalm 74:10; Psalm 79:5; Psalm 89:46; Psalm 90:13). It is a cry of weakness and impatience, but has an element of faith in it, on which God looks with favour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - How long shall they utter and speak hard things? rather, they pour forth, they utter arrogant things; literally, arrogance. And all the workers of iniquity boast themselves; or, \"carry themselves proudly\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They break in pieces thy people, O Lord; or, \"crush,\" \"oppress\" (comp. Isaiah 3:15; Proverbs 22:22, where the verb is evidently used, not of foreign foes, but of domestic oppressors). And afflict thine heritage; or, \"thine inheritance\" - those whom thou hast taken to be thy \"peculiar people\" (Deuteronomy 14:2), thine own exclusive possession.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless (comp.

Psalm 10:11, 13). Foreign enemies did not suppose that Jehovah would not see, but trusted that their own gods were stronger than he, and would protect them (2 Kings 18:33-35). Neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. \"The God of Jacob\" would not be a natural expression in the mouth of Israel's foreign foes. They knew nothing of Jacob. But it was an expression frequently used by Israelites (Genesis 49:24; Psalm 20:1; Psalm 46:7; Psalm 75:9; Psalm 76:6; Psalm 81:1, 4; Isaiah 2:3; Isaiah 41:21; Micah 4:2, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnderstand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-11. - The appeal to Israel. The oppressors thought that their conduct would not be observed by God, or would not be taken into account. The psalmist appeals to them not to be so brutish and foolish (ver. 8), and argues, from the first principles of natural theology, that God must see and hear (ver. 9). If he chastises the heathen, why should he not also punish them (ver. 10)? Verse 8. - Understand, ye brutish among the people (comp. Psalm 92:6). That there were among God's people some so \"brutish\" as to suppose that God either did not see or did not regard their misdoings, appears also from Psalm 10:11, 13. And ye fools, when will ye be wise? When will ye put away your folly, and allow Wisdom to enter into your hearts? She is always crying in the streets: when will ye consent to listen (comp. Proverbs 1:20-23)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see? This argument for a real, personal, intelligent God appears here, for the first time. It is of irresistible force. \"Can it be possible that God, who planned and made the curious mechanism of hearing and vision, is himself without those faculties, or something analogous to them? Must he not hear those cries, and see those outrages, which men, who are his creatures, see and hear? Is it conceivable that he can be an unobservant and apathetic God?\" (Cheyne).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? i.e. if God does not leave even the heathen without rebukes and chastisements, shall he not much more punish those among his own people who do amiss? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? Our version supposes an ellipse, which it fills up with great boldness, producing a very excellent sense. But the insertion made does not appear necessary (see the Revised Version).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man. Not only does the Almighty see and know all the actions of men (ver. 9), but he is even acquainted with their thoughts (comp. Psalm 7:9; Psalm 26:2; Psalm 139:17; Isaiah 66:18; 1 Corinthians 3:20). That they are vanity (comp.

God upholds him when he is in danger of falling.NEWLINENEWLINE8. God inwardly comforts his soul. Verse 12. - Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord. The blessedness of chastening appears in Deuteronomy 7:5; 2 Samuel 7:14, 15; Job 5:17; Psalm 89:32, 33; Proverbs 3:12; and is the main point of Elihu's teaching in Job 33:15-30. It is not, as some have argued, entirely a New Testament doctrine. Unassisted human reason might discover it. Greek poets noted the connection between παθεῖν and μαθεῖν. Our own great dramatist draws upon his experience when he says-NEWLINENEWLINE\"Sweet are the uses of adversity;NEWLINEWhich, like the toad, ugly and venomous,NEWLINEBears yet a precious jewel in his head.\" And teachest him out of thy Law. The existence of \"the Law,\" and the general knowledge of it by God's people, is assumed here, as elsewhere in the Psalms (see especially Psalm 119.). Also it is assumed that \"the Law\" is a revelation from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity. Trials and afflictions are means to an end, and the intended end is \"rest\" and peace. \"There remaineth, therefore, a rest to the people of God\" (Hebrews 4:9). Until the pit be digged for the wicked (comp. Psalm 9:1; Psalm 35:7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance (comp.

However long God's chastisements continue (see ver. 3), the faithful may be sure that God has not forsaken, and never will forsake, them, since \"he forsaketh not his saints, but they are preserved forever\" (Psalm 37:28). The promise is made equally to the faithful individuals (\"his saints\") and to faithful Churches (\"his people,\" \"his inheritance\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But judgment shall return unto righteousness. \"Judgment,\" i.e. God's actual award of good and evil upon the earth, which has seemed to be divorced from justice, while the ungodly have prospered and the pious been afflicted (vers. 3-6), shall in the end \"return unto righteousness,\" i.e. once more, evidently, conform to it and coincide with it. And all the upright in heart shall follow it; i.e. \"and then all honest hearted men shall recognize the fact, see it, and rejoice in it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Who will rise up for me against the evil doers? or, who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? But meanwhile, until this happy time come, what is the condition of the godly? Are they not left a prey to the evil doers, at their mercy, without a champion? The answer is given in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Unless the Lord had been my Help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. No; they are not without a champion; Jehovah is their Help. It is a part of their blessedness (ver. 12), that they are preserved. in life and protected from the wicked, by God himself. Otherwise they \"had soon dwelt in silence.\" Their soul had gone down to the pit, to the abyss of Sheol, the silent land (comp.

Thy comforts delight my soul. Internal comfort is given by God himself to the perplexed and troubled in spirit, whereby they are \"delighted,\" or, rather, \"soothed and solaced.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm94:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTShall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-23. - The destruction of the evil doers. There can be no fellowship between light and darkness - between God and evildoers, especially those who carry out their wicked purposes under the forms of law (ver. 20), and go the length of condemning innocent blood (ver. 21). Such persons God, who defends the righteous (ver. 22), will assuredly bring to utter destruction (ver. 23). Verse 20. - Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee? The interrogative is here, as so often, an emphatic negative. By \"the throne of iniquity\" is meant iniquity in high places, wickedness enthroned upon the judgment seat, and thence delivering its unjust sentences. Oppressors in Israel made a large use of the machinery of the law to crush and ruin their victims (see Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 10:1, 2; Amos 5:7; Amos 6:12, etc.).

Most manifestly when he makes them fall into their own snare (Psalm 7:15; Psalm 35:8; Psalm 57:6; Psalm 141:9, 10), but really also whenever he punishes them for their sins. And shall cut them off; or, \"destroy,\" \"exterminate\" them. In their own wickedness; or, \"by their wickedness.\" The wicked man is often \"hoist with his own petard.\" Yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off.

From this opening phrase, which finds an echo in vers. 2 and 6, this psalm has been called \"The Invitatory Psalm.\" As it invited the Jews, so it now invites Christian congregations, to join in the worship of the sanctuary. Let us make a joyful noise to the Rock of our salvation (comp. Psalm 33:3; Psalm 98:4). Loudness of voice was regarded as indicating earnestness of heart (see 2 Chronicles 20:19; Ezra 3:13; Nehemiah 12:42, etc.). The expression, \"Rock of our salvation\" is taken from Deuteronomy 32:15 (comp. 2 Samuel 22:47; Psalm 89:26).

Thanks and praise are due to God, in the first place, because of his greatness (see Psalm cf. 2). \"Who is so great a god as our God?\" (Psalm 77:13); \"His greatness is unsearchable\" (Psalm 145:3). And a great King above all gods; i.e. \"a goat King above all other so called gods\" - above the great of the earth (Psalm 82:1, 6), above angels (Deuteronomy 10:17), above the imaginary gods of the heathen (Exodus 12:12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm95:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the strength of the hills is his also; rather, the summits of the mountains are his also.

And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand (comp. Psalm 74:1; Psalm 79:13; Psalm 80:1, etc.). We are led by him, tended by him, fed by him, folded by him. We owe everything to his shepherding. Verses 7b-11. - The warning against waywardness.

And as in the day of temptation in the wilderness; rather, and as in the day of Massah. The children of Israel \"tempted\" God, and \"chided\" with Moses at Massah (or Meribah) in the wilderness, where water was first given them out of the rock. Their descendants are warned not to follow the example of their forefathers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm95:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When your fathers tempted me (see Exodus 17:2, 7). Proved me; or, \"tested me\" - put my power and goodness to the proof. And (rather, even) saw my work; i.e. \"saw the water gush forth from the rock, when at my command Moses struck it\" (Exodus 17:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm95:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Forty years long was I grieved with this generation; rather, with that generation - the generation that tempted God in the wilderness (see the Revised Version). And said, It is a people that do err in their heart; literally, a people of wanderers in heart are these; i.e. \"not only are they a people whose feet wander (Psalm 107:4), but their hearts also have wandered and gone astray from my paths.\" And they have not known my ways. \"My ways - the ways of my commandments - are unknown to them, untrodden by them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm95:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Unto whom I sware in my wrath; rather, so that that I sware in my wrath, or \"wherefore I sware in my wrath\" (for the oath itself, see Numbers 14:21-23; and comp. Deuteronomy 1:34, 35). That they should not enter into my rest. The \"rest\" originally intended was that of Canaan, when \"the Lord gave rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about\" (Joshua 23:1). But Canaan was a type of the heavenly rest; and the warning given to the Israel of his day by the present psalmist is to be regarded as a warning that, if they followed in the steps of their forefathers, they might miss of that final and crowning \"rest,\" which, after the wilderness of this world is traversed, still \"remaineth for the people of God\" (see Hebrews 3:7-19; Hebrews 4:1-9).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.96":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O sing unto the Lord a new song (comp. Psalm 33:3; Psalm 98:1; Psalm 144:9; Psalm 149:1; Isaiah 42:10). This clause does not occur in 1 Chronicles 16. It seems to belong to the second recension of the psalm, when it was recast to suit some \"new\" occasion. Sing unto the Lord, all the earth. So in Isaiah 42:10, \"Sing unto the Lord a new song, his praise from the end of the earth.\" The psalmist at once makes known his \"universalism\" by calling on the whole earth to join in his song of praise (comp. Psalm 66:1, 4). This psalm has been well called \"a missionary hymn for all ages.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Sing unto the Lord, bless his Name (cf.

Show forth his salvation from day to day; or, publish his salvation (εὐαγγελίζεσθε, LXX.); i.e. \"make it known\" - \"spread the good tidings.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeclare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Declare his glory among the heathen. Publish God's praise, not only in Israel, but to the ends of the earth. Let all mankind hear the joyful news (comp. Psalm 2:8; Psalm 47:1, 8; Psalm 138:4). His wonders among all people; rather, among all the peoples; i.e. \"all the nations of the earth\" (see ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For the Lord is great (comp. Psalm 95:3a), and greatly to be praised. Whatever is \"great\" excites our admiration, and naturally calls forth our praise. God's greatness is such that he needs to be \"greatly praised.\" He is to be feared above all gods (comp. Psalm 95:3b, and the comment ad loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For all the gods of the nations are idols; rather, vanities, or nothings. In the original there is a play upon the words - the elohim of the nations are mere elilim. Elilim is a favourite designation of the heathen gods in Isaiah. Compare the statement of St. Paul, \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world\" (1 Corinthians 8:4). But the Lord made the heavens. That which is nothing can do nothing, can make nothing. How far superior is Jehovah, who \"made the heavens\" (comp. Genesis 1:1; Isaiah 42:5; Isaiah 44:24)!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHonour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Honour and majesty are before him. Another paronomasia - hod ve-hadar. Dr. Kay translates, \"grandeur and majesty;\" Professor Cheyne, \"glory and grandeur.\" Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. The original phrase used seems to have been, \"Strength and gladness are in his place\" (1 Chronicles 16:27) - terms suiting the simplicity of David's time. When the psalms came to be used in the temple service, loftier language was more fitting. The whole passage has probable reference to the glory of God as seated between the cherubim in the first temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people; rather, O ye fatuities of the peoples. A renewed appeal to the heathen to join in the song of praise (comp. ver. 1). Give unto the Lord glory and strength. \"Give\" must be understood in the sense of \"ascribe\" (see Professor Cheyne's translation, and compare the Prayer book Version). Both this and the next verse are echoes of Psalm 29:1, 2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGive unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name; literally, the glory of his Name. Bring an. offering, and come into his courts. The parallel expression in 1 Chronicles 16:29 is, \"Come before him.\" \"Courts\" would be inappropriate until the temple was built. (For the bringing of \"an offering\" (minchah) by the Gentiles, see Malachi 1:11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness (comp. 1 Chronicles 16:29; Psalm 29:2). This is generally explained as \"holiday attire.\" or \"in vestments suited to holy service,\" but may include, besides vestments, the other material accessories of Divine worship. Fear before him, all the earth; or, tremble before him (comp. Psalm 97:4). The fear of God is constantly inculcated by the psalmists, not only as \"the beginning of wisdom\" (Psalm 111:10), but as required of every man during his whole life (Psalm 19:9; Psalm 34:9; Psalm 40:3; Psalm 64:9; Psalm 86:11; Psalm 119:63, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth (comp. Psalm 93:1; Psalm 97:1; Psalm 99:1). The world also shall be established that it shall not be moved. When God takes his throne, and manifestly reigns, the earth is at once \"established,\" settled, placed on a firm footing (see the comment on Psalm 93:1, where exactly the same words occur). He shall judge the people righteously (comp. ver. 13). God, the Deliverer of old time (vers. 3, 4), God, the King of the whole earth (ver. 10a), is also God the Judge, who gives sentence on the \"peoples\" with equity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad. \"An appeal for the sympathy of nature\" (Cheyne); comp. Isaiah 44:23; Jeremiah 51:48. If the final coming of Messiah's kingdom be the event alluded to in ver. 10, as is quite possible, the calling on heaven and earth to rejoice may indicate a real renovation of the material universe, such as to bring it into harmony with the newly established spiritual conditions of the period (comp. Isaiah 65:17-25; Revelation 21:1-4). Lot the sea roar, and the fulness thereof (comp. Psalm 98:7). The sea is to show its joy by raising its voice, and \"roaring,\" or \"thundering.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoiceVERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Let the field be joyful; i.e. \"the cultivated ground.\" And all that is therein. Its vines, its olives, its other fruits, and its harvests. Then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord. Lebanon and Bashan shall rejoice equally with Carmel and Sharon. The whole earth shall \"break forth into singing\" (see Isaiah 44:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm96:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth (see above, ver. 10). This is given as the reason for the burst of joy. God's coming to judgment is the establishment of moral order in the place of moral disorder upon the earth, and the inauguration of a reign of love, peace, and happiness (comp. Isaiah 65:18-25). He shall judge the world with righteousness (see above, ver. 10, and comp. Psalm 9:8). The judgment which the psalmist has specially in view is, \"not a retributive, but a gracious judging, by which controversies are adjusted and prevented, and the law of love introduced into the life of the people\" (Hengstenberg). And the people with his truth; rather, the peoples; i.e. all the nations on the face of the earth.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.97":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord reigneth; or, the Lord has become King - has ascended his throne (comp. Psalm 93:1; Psalm 96:10). Let the earth rejoice. When God condescends to appear on earth, the earth is bound to rejoice. His coming cannot but improve the condition of affairs. Let the multitude of isles (literally, the many isles) be glad thereof. Even \"the isles\" - the abode of the Gentiles - are to feel joy, for they, too, at whatever cost (ver. 3), will be benefited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTClouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Clouds and darkness are round about him (comp. Exodus 19:16, 18; Deuteronomy 4:11; Deuteronomy 5:22:1 Kings 8:12). The \"darkness\" does not belong to the nature of God, who \"is Light, and in him is no darkness at all\" (1 John 1:5), but to the interrelationship between God and man, in which are involved problems that man cannot solve. Righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne; rather, the foundation of his throne - the firm basis on which it is immovably fixed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A fire goeth before him. So long as there is evil in the world, the \"fire\" of God's wrath must necessarily \"go before him\" at each theophany, to sweep the evil from his path (see Isaiah 42:25). It is in this sense that \"our God is a consuming fire\" (Hebrews 12:29). And burneth up his enemies round about (comp. Psalm 50:8; Matthew 13:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His lightnings enlightened the world. Here the tenses change from present to past - not, however, that any past event is alluded to, but merely to mark prophetic certainty. The psalmist, rapt in vision, sees the future as past. Lightnings play a part in almost' all theophanies (Exodus 19:16; Job 37:1-5; Psalm 18:13; Psalm 77:18, etc.). The earth saw, and trembled (comp. Judges 5:4; Psalm 68:8; Psalm 114:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord (comp. Judges 5:5; Isaiah 64:1; Micah 1:4). The earth itself is regarded as not only shaken (ver. 4), but as melting and crumbling away at the descent of God from heaven to earth (comp. 2 Peter 3:10). At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth (comp. Joshua 3:11, 13; Micah 4:13; Zechariah 4:14; Zechariah 6:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The heavens declare his righteousness (comp. Psalm 50:6; Matthew 24:29, 30). By signs in the heavens it is proclaimed that the Lord has come to judgment. And all the people see (rather, have seen) his glory; literally, all the peoples; i.e. all the nations of the earth (comp. ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConfounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols. Professor Cheyne transposes this verse and the next, but without any necessity. It is quite natural that the effect of the theophany on God's enemies should be noted first. The effect is that they are \"confounded,\" or rather, covered with shame. The display of real Divine power makes manifest the impotency of the idols, and puts their worshippers to the blush. Worship him, all ye gods. The theophany is a call on the false gods to worship the true God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTZion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Zion heard, and was glad (comp. Psalm 48:11). To Zion, the Church of God, the company of his saints, the theophany brings, not shame, but rejoicing. The Lord comes for their relief, for their deliverance, for their exaltation. And the daughters of Judah rejoiced. The\"daughters of Judah\" are the other cities of Judaea besides Jerusalem. In a Christian sense, they may be taken to represent the irregularly organized Churches, which will participate in the general joy of the faithful at Christ's final coming. Because of thy judgments, O Lord. It does not show any vindictive feeling, if the saints, persecuted so long, \"rejoice\" when an end is put to their sufferings by the final judgment of the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth; rather, art the Most High (eliun) above all the earth (see the Revised Version). Thou art exalted far above all gods (comp. ver. 7, and see also Psalm 83:18). No comparison can be made between Jehovah and the heathen gods. He is \"exalted\" far, far above them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ye that love the Lord, hate evil. The psalmist ends his strain with an exhortation to the faithful - an exhortation, first of all, to \"hate evil.\" God hates evil (Psalm 45:7); evil will separate them from God, evil will be their destruction. Therefore let them hate and abhor it. It is indifference to evil, that, more than anything else, lays men open to the assaults of Satan. He preserveth the souls of his saints. He (i.e. Jehovah) watches tenderly over the souls of his saints - his holy loving ones, and preserves them in being, keeps them from destruction, and delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLight is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Light is sown for the righteous (comp. Psalm 112:4, \"Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness\"). God sheds the rays of his grace on the path of the righteous man, enlightens his understanding, and illumines his spirit perpetually. And gladness for the upright in heart. Together with \"light,\" he sheds abroad \"gladness,\" the irrepressible joy which comes from a sense of his favour and protection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm97:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous. Such being the blessedness of the righteous, they are finally exhorted to \"rejoice in the Lord,\" i.e. to show forth their gratitude to God in psalms and hymns of joy (comp. Psalm 32:11; Psalm 33:1-3), and to give thanks to him at the remembrance of his holiness; or rather, to give thanks to his holy memorial, which is the same as giving thanks to his Name (comp. Psalm 30:4, and the comment ad loc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.98":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm98:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - O sing unto the Lord a new song (comp. Psalm 96, which opens similarly). The faithful and wise steward is ever bringing out of his treasures things which are at once old and \"new.\" For he hath done marvellous things. The \"marvellous things\" which God has done for man constitute the first ground for praising him. These marvels may be either those of his ordinary providence, or special interpositions and deliverances. His right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory; rather, hath wrought salvation for him (see the Revised Version; and comp.

His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the heathen. God has vindicated in the eyes of all the nations upon earth the righteousness of his rule over mankind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm98:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - He hath remembered his mercy and his truth towards the house of Israel.

God is to be praised heartily - with a loud and ringing voice. The body is to unite with the soul in giving him thanks, and to perform its part vigorously and with zeal (comp. Psalm 5:3; Psalm 66:1; Psalm 81:1; Psalm 95:1, 2; Psalm 100:1, etc.). And in the praise of God the whole earth is to join.

Exodus 15:20; 2 Samuel 6:15; 1 Chronicles 15:16, 28; 1 Chronicles 16:6; 2 Chronicles 5:12, 13; Ezra 3:10; Nehemiah 12:27, etc.).

The chatsotseroth are \"the straight trumpets, such as are seen on the Arch of Titus, used by the priests for giving signals\" (Kay). The shophar is the ordinary curved or rounded trumpet or horn. Make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King; literally, before the King, Jehovah.

The call on the inanimate things of nature to rejoice is grounded on man's sympathy with nature, which makes him desire, and half believe, that nature may sympathize with him.

Psalm 24:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm98:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful togetherVERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Let the floods clap their hands. This bold metaphor occurs only here and in Isaiah 55:12, where the \"trees\" are asked to \"clap their hands.\" Let the hills be joyful together before the Lord; or, sing for joy together; i.e. join with the rest of nature in expressing gladness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm98:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBefore the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For he cometh to judge the earth. Nature, inanimate and animate, may well be asked to rejoice when God comes to judge the earth - since he is sure to judge it aright. With righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity. \"God by his righteous judgment will bring the whole earth from a state of sorrow into a state of salvation and joy\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.99":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord reigneth (see the comment on Psalm 93:1). Let the people tremble; literally, the peoples; i.e. all the nations upon earth. He sitteth between the cherubim; rather, he hath his seat upon the cherubim (comp. Psalm 80:2). The imagery is taken from the internal economy of the Jewish temple, where the Shechinah was enthroned above the cherubic forms that overshadowed and guarded the ark.

Secondarily great, or \"high,\" among the nations which do not acknowledge him, but are forced to tremble before him (see ver. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Let them praise thy great and terrible Name. Even the Gentiles, after conversion, will praise the Lord, sing of him, and bless his Name. (On the \"greatness\" and \"terribleness\" of God, see Exodus 15:11; Deuteronomy 7:21; Deuteronomy 10:17; Nehemiah 1:5; Nehemiah 4:14; Psalm 68:35, etc.) For it is holy; rather, holy is he. This may be a suggestion to those about to praise God - a putting of words into their mouth; or it may be an almost involuntary outburst of praise on the part of the psalmist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The King's strength also loveth judgment. \"The king\" is here the Lord, Jehovah (see Psalm 98:3). His \"strength,\" or might, \"loves,\" and is always combined with, right (comp. Isaiah 61:8, \"I the Lord love judgment\"). Thou dost establish equity. The pronoun is emphatic: \"Thou, even thou\" - nearly equivalent to \"thou only\" - \"dost establish equity.\" Thou - again emphatic - \"thou, even thou\" - executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob; i.e. governest thy people Israel with strict and absolute justice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Exalt ye the Lord our God (comp. ver. 9; and see also Psalm 118:20 and Isaiah 25:1). And worship at his footstool. The \"footstool of God\" is everywhere (except in Isaiah 66:1) the ark of the covenant, which he that sat upon the cherubim touched, as it were, with his feet (see 1 Chronicles 28:2; Psalm 132:7; Lamentations 2:1; Isaiah 60:13). Israel is called upon to worship God as he sits in his holy temple, enthroned above the cherubim, with his feet upon the mercy seat. For he is holy; rather, as in ver. 3, holy is he.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Moses and Aaron among his priests. Moses, though not called a priest in the Pentateuch, performed many priestly acts, such as sprinkling the blood of the covenant at Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:6-8), setting in order the tabernacle (Exodus 40:18-33), consecrating Aaron and his sons (Leviticus 8:6-30), interceding for the people (Exodus 32:30-32; Numbers 14:13-19), etc. He is therefore, not improperly, here included among God's priests. And Samuel among them that call upon his Name. Samuel was not a priest, but a simple Levite (1 Chronicles 6:16-28). He was, however, a powerful intercessor with God, a righteous man whose effectual fervent prayer availed much. He is united with Moses by Jeremiah, as having weight with God through his prayers (Jeremiah 15:1; see also 1 Samuel 12:19-22). They called upon the Lord, and he answered them (see Deuteronomy 11:19; Deuteronomy 10:10; 1 Samuel 12:17, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar (see Exodus 33:9, \"And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door.., and the Lord talked with Moses\"). They kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. Moses was known as \"the servant of the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 34:5; Joshua 1:1, 2, etc.). He was \"faithful in all his house, as a servant\" (Hebrews 3:5). Aaron was \"the saint of the Lord\" (Psalm 106:16). This general obedience was, however, departed from in some few instances (see the comment on ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God (comp. ver. 6, ad fin.). Thou wast a God that forgavest them; literally, a forgiving God wast thou to them. Both Moses and Aaron \"angered God at the waters of strife\" (Psalm 106:32; Numbers 20:12, 13). Aaron angered him still more by sanctioning the idolatry of the golden calf (Exodus 32:1-24). God pardoned both of them these and other sins, but not without inflicting punishment for the sins. Though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions. God's \"severity\" extended even to these blessed saints, Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. The former two were expressly excluded from the land of promise for their conduct at Meribah (Numbers 20:12); and Samuel's judgeship seems to have been brought to an end through his undue leniency towards his sons Joel and Abiah (1 Samuel 8:1-5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm99:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTExalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill. Repeated from ver. 5, with the slight variation that \"his holy hill\" is substituted for \"his footstool\" - Zion, on which the temple stood, for the sanctuary of the temple itself. For the Lord our God is holy; rather, for holy is the Lord our God (comp. vers. 3 and 5).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Ps.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART<> I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; rather, I will give thanks (Kay, Cheyne, Revised Version). The thanks are special for a great deliverance - a deliverance from some heathen enemy (vers. 5, 15), who has been signally defeated and almost exterminated (vers. 5, 6). It has been conjectured that the subjugation of Ammon (2 Samuel 12:26-31) is the occasion referred to ('Speaker's Commentary'); but the expectation of further attack (vers. 17-20) scarcely suits this period, when David's wars were well-nigh over. Perhaps the earlier victory over Ammon and Syria (2 Samuel 10:6-14), which was followed by the renewed invasion of the same nations in conjunction with \"the Syrians beyond the river\" (2 Samuel 10:16), is more likely to have drawn forth the composition. I will show forth all thy marvellous works; rather, I will tell forth, or I will recount all thy wondrous deeds. Not necessarily miracles, but any strange and unexpected deliverances, such as the recent one (comp. Psalm 40:5; Psalm 78:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy Name (see the comment on Psalm 8:9). O thou most High (comp. Psalm 7:17; and see also Genesis 14:18, 19, 22). Ellen (עֶלְיון) was a recognized name of God among the Phoenicians ('Religions of the Ancient World,' p. 133).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When mine enemies are turned back; or, because mine enemies are turned back ('Speaker's Commentary'); i.e. made to retreat, repulsed, driven before me in hasty flight. They shall fall and perish at thy presence; or, they stumble and perish, etc. The psalmist represents the enemy, poetically, \"as if they had been thrown to the ground by the glance of God's fiery countenance\" (Hengstenberg).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For thou hast maintained my right and my cause. David uniformly ascribes his military successes, not to his own ability, or even to the valour of his soldiers, but to God's favour. God's favour, which is secured by the justice of his cause, gives him victory after victory. Thou surest in the throne judging right. While the late battle raged, God sat upon his heavenly throne, administering justice, awarding defeat and death to the wrong-doers who had wantonly attacked his people, giving victory and glory and honour to those who stood on their defence against the aggressors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou hast rebuked the heathen; rather, thou didst rebuke; LXX., ἐπετίμησας: i.e. on the recent occasion. When God would rebuke, be punishes; when he punishes, by so doing he rebukes. Thou hast destroyed the wicked; rather, thou didst destroy. Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. If taken literally, this should mean extermination, and so some explain (Hengstenberg, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'); but some allowance must be made for the use of hyperbole by a poet. None of the nations with which David contended suffered extinction or extermination.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end. It is better to translate, with the Revised Version, The enemy are come to an end; they are desolate for ever - a continuance of the hyperbole already noticed in the preceding verse. And thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them; rather, and as for the cities thou hast destroyed, their very memory has perished. This could only be an anticipation. It was fulfilled in the complete disappearance from history of the names of Zoba, Beth-rehob, and Tob, after the victory described in 2 Samuel 10:13, 14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But the Lord shall endure for ever; rather, but the Lord is seated (i.e. upon his throne)for ever. Cities and nations perish, but Jehovah remains a King for evermore. While all is change and disturbance upon earth, the unchanged and unchangeable Eternal One continues constantly seated, in serene majesty, in heaven. He hath prepared (or rather, established) his throne for judgment (compare the second clause of per. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And he shall judge the world. The \"he\" is emphatic - he himself, and no other. From his throne of judgment he shall judge, not Israel's enemies only, whom he has just judged (vers. 3-6), but the whole world. In righteousness; i.e. by a strict law of justice, rewarding to all men \"after their deserving.\" He shall minister judgment to the people (rather, the peoples; i.e. all the people of all the earth) in uprightness; literally, in uprightnesses - a plural of perfection.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Lord also will be a Refuge for the oppressed. Misgab, translated \"refuge,\" is literally \"a hill-fort\" (comp. Psalm 144:2, where it is rendered \"high tower\"). David's use of the metaphor is reasonably ascribed to his having \"often experienced safety in such places, when fleeing from Saul\" (Hengstenberg; see 1 Samuel 23:14). A refuge in times of trouble; literally, in times in trouble; i.e. \"in times that are steeped in trouble\" (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee. \"To know the Name of God is to know him according to his historical manifestation; when one hears him named, to call to remembrance all that he has done. His name is the focus in which all the rays of his actions meet\" (Hengstenberg). All who \"know God's Name\" in this sense will be sure to \"put their trust in him,\" since his historical manifestation shows that he is thoroughly to he depended on. For thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee. Never in the past, so far as David knew, had God forsaken those who faithfully clung to him. They might be tried, like Job; they might be \"hunted upon the mountains,\" like David himself; they might even have the sense of being forsaken (Psalm 22:1); but they were not forsaken nevertheless. God \"forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever\" (Psalm 37:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Sing praises to the Lord. Having praised God himself (vers. 1, 2), and declared the grounds upon which his praises rest (vers. 3-10), David now calls upon all faithful Israelites to join him in his song of thanksgiving. \"Sing praises unto the Lord,\" he says, which dwelleth in Zion. Who is enthroned, i.e., on the mercy-seat between the cherubim in the tabernacle, now set up upon Mount Zion (2 Samuel 6:1-17). The date of the psalm is thus to some extent limited, since it must have been composed subsequently to the transfer of the ark to Jerusalem. Declare among the people his doings. In the original \"among the peoples\" (עַמִּים); i.e. not the people of Israel only, but all the surrounding nations. David is possessed with the conviction that the revelation of God made to Israel is not to be confined to them, but through them to be communicated to \"all the ends of the earth\" - to the heathen at large, to all nations (comp. Psalm 18:49; Psalm 66:4; Psalm 72:11, 19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them; rather, for he that maketh inquisition for blood (see Genesis 9:5) remembereth them. God, i.e., the Requirer of blood (Kay), remembers, when he makes his inquisition, those who are oppressed (per. 9), and who seek him (ver. 10). He forgetteth not the cry of the humble; or, the afflicted (Kay, Cheyne). He comes to the aid of such persons, and avenges them on their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHave mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Have mercy upon me, O Lord! The consideration of God's mercies in the past, and especially in the recent deliverance, leads the psalmist to implore a continuance of his mercies in the future. He is not yet free from troubles. There are still enemies who afflict and threaten him - \"heathen\" who seek to \"prevail\" against him (vers. 19, 20), and perhaps already domestic enemies, especially the \"sons of Zeruiah,\" causing him anxiety. Consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me; literally, my trouble (or, my affliction) from my haters. Vers. 17, 19, 20 show that the heathen are especially intended (see 2 Samuel 10:15-19). Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; i.e. \"Thou that continually (or, habitually) art my Support in the extremity of peril,\" \"lifting me up\" even from the very \"gates of death.\" (For other mentions of \"the gates of death,\" see Job 38:17; Psalm 107:18.) Classical writers speak of \"the gates of darkness\" (σκότου πύλας) in almost the same sense (Eurip., 'Hec.,' 1. 1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion. The \"daughter of Zion\" is, of course, Jerusalem. Compare \"daughter of Babylon\" (Psalm 137:8; Isaiah 47:1; Jeremiah 50:42; Zechariah 2:7), \"daughter of the Chaldeans\" (Isaiah 47:1, 5), \"daughter of Edom\" (Lamentations 4:21, 22), \"daughter of Gallim\" (Isaiah 10:30). Hengstenberg is probably right in understanding \"in the gates\" as \"within the gates,\" since, as he observes, \"God's praise is not to be celebrated in the gates, amid the throng of worldly business, but in the temple.\" The references in the ' Speaker's Commentary' do not bear out the statement there made, that \"public mournings and public thanksgivings were proclaimed in the gates.\" I will rejoice in thy salvation; or, that I may rejoice (Kay).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made. It is uncertain whether the writer here reverts to the judgment already executed (vers. 3-6), or with the eye of faith sees as past the judgment which he confidently anticipates (vers. 19, 20). Whichever he intends, there can be no doubt that he means it to be understood that the stratagems of the enemy brought about (or would bring about) their downfall. In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. A second metaphor, expressing the same idea as the preceding (comp. Psalm 7:15, 16; Psalm 10:2; Psalm 35:8; Psalm 141:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth; rather, the Lord hath made himself known; he executeth judgment (see the Revised Version; and comp. Ezekiel 20:9). The two clauses are grammatically distinct, though no doubt closely connected in their meaning. God makes himself known - manifests his character, by the judgments which he executes, shows himself just, perhaps severe, certainly One who \"will not at all acquit the wicked\" (Nahum 1:3). The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Some translate, \"he snareth the wicked,\" or, \"by snaring the wicked\" - the special way in which God manifests himself (see Kay, p. 31; 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 190). Higgaion. This word is found in three other places only, viz. Psalm 19:14; Psalm 92:3; and Lamentations 3:61. In the first it is translated \"meditation,\" and has clearly that meaning; in the second it is supposed to mean \"a gentle strain:\" in the third it seems best rendered by \"musing\" or \"reflection.\" Here it stands by itself, as a sort of rubrical direction, like the following word, \"Selah.\" Some suppose it a direction to the choir to play a gentle strain of instrumental music as an interlude; others regard it as enjoining upon the congregation a space of quiet \"meditation\" (see Hengstenberg, ad loc.; and compare Professor Alexander's work, 'The Psalms translated and explained,' p. 45). Selah (see the comment on Psalm 3:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The wicked shall be tamed into hell; literally, shall be turned backwards to Sheol, or Hades; i.e. shall be removed from earth to the place of departed spirits. There is no direct threat of retribution or punishment, beyond the peens damni, or loss of all that is pleasing and delightful in this life. And all the nations that forget God; rather, even all the people (Kay). \"The wicked\" and \"the people that forget God\" are identical.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For the needy shall not alway be forgotten. The peer and needy, the oppressed and down-trodden (vers. 9, 12), seem for a time to be forgotten of God; but even this seeming oblivion comes to an end when judgment fails on the oppressors (ver. 17). The expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever. \"The expectation of the poor\" is deliverance. It shall not \"perish,\" or be disappointed, \"for ever,\" i.e. always. There shall be a time when their expectation shall have its accomplishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Arise, O Lord (comp. Psalm 7:6, and the comment ad loc.). Let not man prevail; or, let not weak man prevail. The word used for \"man,\" enosh, carries with it the idea of weakness. That \"weak man\" should prevail over God is preposterous. Let the heathen be judged in thy sight. If judged, then, as being wicked, condemned; if condemned, then punished - defeated, ruined, brought to nought (see ver. 5)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTPsalm9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPut them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Put them in fear, O Lord; literally, set fear to them; i.e. \"make them afraid,\" either by striking a panic terror into them, as into the Syrians when they had brought Samaria to the last gasp (2 Kings 7:6, 7), or by causing them calmly to review the situation, and to see how dangerous it was to assail God's people (2 Kings 6:23). That the nations may know themselves to be but men. May recognize, i.e., their weakness; may remember that they are enosh - mere weak, frail, sickly, perishing mortals. Selah. Here this word occurs for the second time at the end of a psalm (see above, Psalm 3:8) - a position which militates against the idea of its signifying \"a pause,\" since there must always have been a pause at the end of every psalm.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
