{"1John.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The first clause states what or how the object is in itself; the next three state St. John's relation to it; \"which,\" in the first clause nominative, in the others is accusative. The neuter (ὅ) expresses a collective and comprehensive whole (John 4:22; John 6:37; John 17:2; Acts 17:23, etc.); the attributes of the Λόγος rather than the Λόγος himself are indicated. Or, as Jelf expresses it, \"the neuter gender denotes immaterial personality, the masculine or feminine material personality.\" In the beginning is not quite the same as in John 1:1; there St. John tells us that the Word was in existence before the world was created; here that he was in existence before he was manifested. Thus far all is indefinite; the philosopher, about to expound a law of nature, might begin, \"That which was from the beginning declare we unto you.\" What follows is in a climax, making the meaning clearer at each step: seeing is more than hearing, and handling than seeing. The climax is in two pairs, of perfects and of aorists; the aorists giving the past acts, the perfects the permanent results. Together they sum up the apostolic experience of that boundless activity of Christ, of which the world could not contain the full account (John 21:25). Beheld ἐθεασάμεθα is more than have seen ἑωράκαμεν. Seeing might be momentary; beholding implies that steady contemplation, for which the beloved disciple had large and abundantly used opportunities. In our hands handled we may see a reference to Luke 24:39, where the same verb is used ψηλαφήσατε; and still more to John 20:27, where the demanded test of handling is offered to St. Thomas, provoking the confession of faith to which the whole Gospel leads up, \"My Lord and my God!\" Had St. John merely said \"heard,\" we might have thought that he meant a doctrine. Had he merely said \"heard and seen,\" we might have understood it of the effects of Christ's doctrine. But \"our hands handled\" shows clearly that the attributes of the Word become flesh are what St. John insists on, and probably as a contradiction of Docetism. \"Those who read his letter could have no doubt that he was referring to the time when he saw the face of Jesus Christ, when he heard his discourses, when he grasped his hand, when he leaned upon his breast\" (Maurice). Between the first clause and what follows lies the tremendous fact of the Incarnation; and St. John piles verb on verb, and clause on clause, to show that he speaks with the authority of full knowledge, and that there is no possible room for Ebionite or Cerinthian error. The first clause assures us that Jesus was no mere man; the others assure us that he was really man. Precisely that Being who was in existence from the beginning is that of whom St. John and others have had, and still possess, knowledge by all the means through which knowledge can have access to the mind of man. (For \"seeing with the eyes,\" cf. Luke 2:30; for θεᾶσθαι of contemplating with delight [Stark 16:11, 14], John 1:14, 34; Acts 1:11.) Concerning the Word of life. \"Concerning\" περί may depend on \"have heard,\" and, by a kind of zengma, on the other three verbs also; or on the main verb,\" we declare.\" \"The Word of life\" means \"the Word who is the Life,\" like \"the city of Rome,... the Book of Genesis;\" the genitive case is \"the characterizing or identifying genitive.\" The περί is strongly against the interpretation, \"the word of life,\" i.e., the life-giving gospel. Had St. John meant this, he would probably have written ὅν ἀκηκόαμεν... τὸν λόγον τῆς ζωῆς ἀπαγγέλλομεν (John 5:24, 37; John 8:43; John 14:24); περί is very frequent of persons (John 1:7, 8, 15, 22, 30, 48, etc.). Moreover, the evident connexion between the introductions to his Gospel and Epistle compels us to understand ὁ Λόγος in the same sense in both (see on John 1:1 in this Commentary, and in the 'Cambridge Greek Testament' or 'Bible for Schools'). What St. John has to announce is his own experience of the Eternal Word incarnate, the Eternal Life made manifest (John 14:6); his hearing of his words, his seeing with his own eyes his Messianic works, his contemplation of the Divinity which shone through both; his handling of the body of the risen Redeemer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Parenthetical. The main thought of verses 1 and 3 is, \"We declare to you a Being both eternal and yet seen and known by us.\" That of verse 2 is, \"This Being, in his character of the Life, became visible, and in him are centered all the relations between God and man.\" Quite in St. John's style, verse 2 takes up and develops a portion of verse 1, using its last word as the basis of a new departure (comp. John 1:14; ἐφανερώθη gives the same fact as σάρξ ἐγένετο from another point of view). Became flesh is the fact in itself; the incarnation of the Λόγος. \"Was manifested\" is the fact in reference to mankind; their admission to the knowledge of it. The union of \"see\" with \"bear witness\" recalls John 19:35; and here, again, verse 2 resumes and develops part of verse 1. Have seen sums up the four verbs in verse 1; for in all languages sight is used of experience generally. Bear witness and declare carries us a stage further - the communication of the experience. It is doubtful whether τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον is the object of all four verbs or of ἀπαγγέλλομεν only. Note the double article: the life, the eternal life. The Epistle begins and ends with this theme (1 John 5:20). (For ἥτις and πρός, cf. John 8:53; John 1:1.) Which indeed (as all must know) was with the rather. The verse ends as it began, but not with a mere repetition; the Life was manifested, and in particular to us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The main sentence is resumed from verse 1, only the chief points being retouched. We declare to you also καί must be read before ὑμῖν, on overwhelming authority); i.e., \"you as well as we must share in it,\" rather than \"you as well as others to whom we have declared it.\" Of course, ἀπαγγέλλομεν, must be rendered alike in both verses \"we declare.\" To what does it refer? Not to this Epistle, which does not contain the writer's experience of the Word of life manifested to mankind, but to his Gospel, which the Epistle is to accompany. The parallel between the two writings must often be noted, especially between the Epistle and John 17. Compare this verse with John 17:21. St. John's aim in writing his Gospel is that the great High Priest's prayer may be fulfilled - that believers may be one in that communion of which the unity between the Father and the Son is the pattern and the basis; may \"be joined together in the same body, the same belief, the same knowledge, the same sins, the same hopes, the same destinies\" (Jelf). Communion with Christians is shown to mean a great deal - no less than communion with the Father and with the Son. Note the double μετά St. John's writings teem with indications of the unity and yet distinctness between the Father and the Son. Communion with the one, so far from absorbing and canceling communion with the other, implies it as a separate bliss. The clause καὶ ἡ κοινωνία δὲ κ.τ.λ.., does not depend on ἵνα, as the δέ shows; we must supply ἔστι, not ῇ. (For καὶ.. δὲ, cf. John 6:51, where, as here, καὶ is the leading conjunction; in John 8:16, 17 and John 15:27, δέ leads.) \"Blessed are they that see not and yet believe. It is we who are here described, we who are designated. Then let the blessedness take place in us, of which the Lord predicted that it should take place. Let us firmly hold that which we see not, because those tell us who have seen\" (St. Augustine, in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - While verses 1-3 refer to the Gospel, this refers to the Epistle; but, although ταῦτα in 1 John 2:26 and 1 John 5:13 refer to what precedes, there is no need to limit ταῦτα here to these opening verses; it covers the whole Epistle. The reading ἡμεῖς seems preferable to ὑμῖν, and ἡμῶν to ὑμῶν. But ἡμεῖς and ἡμῶν are not coordinate: ἡμεῖς is the apostolic \"we;\" ἡμῶν means \"your joy as well as mine.\" This verse takes the place of the usual \"grace and peace\" in the opening of other Epistles; and as verse 3 recalls John 17:21, so this recalls John 17:13. The joy is that of knowing that, though in the world, they are not of it, but are one with one another, and with the Father and with the Son. The gospel is always joy: \"Rejoice alway\" (1 Thessalonians 5:16); \"Rejoice in the Lord alway\" (Philippians 4:4). To know that the Eternal Life has been manifested, that we have communion with him, and through him with the Father, must be joy. Whereas Gnosticism, by denying the atonement, and \"the personal office of God in the salvation of the world,\" cuts off one great sphere of God's love, and consequently one great cause of the believer's joy. To sum up this introduction: St. John gives his Gospel to the Church ἀπαγγέλλομεν in order that all may share in the union for which Christ prayed; and to the Gospel he adds this Epistle καὶ ταῦτα γράφομεν, that all may realize the joy resulting from this union - that our joy may be fulfilled. In this introduction we find the following expressions which are characteristic of St. John, serving to show the common authorship of the Gospel and Epistle, and in some cases of the Revelation also: ὁ Λόγος ἡ ζωή φανερόω μαρτυρέω ζωὴ αἰώνιος η΅ν πρός ἡ χαρὰ η΅ι πεπληρωμένη. It is among the many excellences of the Revised Version that characteristic expressions are marked by a uniform translation; whereas in the Authorized Version they are obscured by capriciously varying the translation: e.g. μαρτυρέω is rendered in four different ways - \"bear witness,\" \"bear record,\" \"give record,\" \"testify\" (cf. page 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5-1 John 2:28. - 2. FIRST MAIN DIVISION. God is Light. Verse 5-1 John 2:6. -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Positive side. What walking in the light involves; the condition and conduct of the believer.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) 1 John 2:7-28. Negative side. What walking in the light excludes; the things and persons to be avoided. Verse 5. - This verse constitutes the text and basis of this division of the Epistle, especially on its positive side. And the message which we have heard... is this. Again we have a remarkable parallel between Gospel and Epistle; both begin with a καί (which connects the opening with the introduction in a simple and artless manner), and with the same kind of sentence: \"And the witness of John is this.\" The reading ἐπαγγελία (1 John 2:25, and frequent in the New Testament) must be rejected here and in 1 John 3:11 in favour of ἀγγελία (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament), on overwhelming evidence. Ἐπαγγελία in the New Testament means \"promise,\" which would be almost meaningless here. The change from ἐπαγγέλλομεν (verses 2, 3) to ἀναγγέλλομεν is noteworthy: the one is \"declare,\" the other \"announce.\" The message received from Christ, the apostle announces or reports (renunciat) to his readers. He does not name Christ ἀπ αὐτοῦ; he is so full of the thought of Christ that he omits to name him (cf. John 20:7, 9, 15). Ἀναγγέλλω is used of authoritative announcements; of priests and Levites in the LXX; of the Messiah (John 4:25); of the Spirit (John 16:13, 14, 15); of the apostles (Acts 20:20, 27; 1 Peter 1:12). St. John speaks with authority. God is light; not the Light, nor a light, but light; that is his nature. This sums up the Divine essence on its intellectual side, as \"God is love\" on its moral side. In neither case has the predicate the article: ὁ Θεὸς φῶς ἐστίν ὁ Θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν. Light and love are not attributes of God, but himself. The connexion between this message and the introduction is not at first obvious. But St. John writes with his Gospel before him, and the prologue to that supplies the link. There, as here, three ideas follow in order: λόγος ζωή φῶς. There, as here, φῶς immediately suggests its opposite, σκοτία. It is on the revelation of the Λόγος as φῶς, and the consequent struggle between φῶς and σκοτία, that the Gospel is based. And this revelation is the highest: men alone are competent to receive or reject it. Other organisms exhibit the creative power as life: none but men can recognize it as light. And to know the Λόγος as light is to know the Father as light; for the Λόγος is the Revelation of the Father's nature. That God is, in his very nature, light, is an announcement peculiar to St. John. Others tell us that he is the Father of lights (James 1:17), the Possessor of light (1 Peter 2:9), dwelling in light (1 Timothy 6:16); but not that he is light. To the heathen God is a God of darkness, an unknown Being; a Power to be blindly propitiated, not a Person to be known and loved. To the philosopher he is an abstraction, an idea, not directly cognizable by man. To the Jews he is a God who hideth himself; not light, but a consuming fire. To the Christian alone he is revealed as light, absolutely free from everything impure, material, obscure, and gloomy. Light was the first product of the Divine creative energy, the earnest and condition of order, beauty, life, growth, and joy. Of all phenomena it best represents the elements of all perfection. \"This word 'light' is at once the simplest and the fullest and the deepest which can be used in human discourse. It is addressed to every man who has eyes and who has ever looked on the sun.\" It tells not only \"of a Goodness and Truth without flaw; it tells of a Goodness and Truth that are always seeking to spread themselves, to send forth rays that shall penetrate everywhere, and scatter the darkness which opposes them\" (Maurice). In like manner, darkness sums up the elements of evil - foulness, secrecy, repulsiveness, and gloom. In all but the lowest forms of existence it inevitably produces decay and death. Everything of the kind is excluded from the nature of God. And hence St. John, in his characteristic manner, immediately emphasizes the great announcement with an equivalent negative statement: Darkness in him there is not any at all (comp. verse 8; 1 John 2:4, 23, 27; 1 John 3:6; 1 John 4:2, 3, 6-8; 1 John 5:12). He does not say, \"in his presence,\" but \"in him.\" Darkness exists, physical, intellectual, moral, and spiritual; there is abundance of obscurity, error, depravity, sin, and its consequence, death. But not a shade of these is \"in him.\" The Divine Light is subject to no spots, no eclipse, no twilight, no night; as a Source of light it cannot in any degree fail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A corollary from verse 5. If God is Light to the exclusion of all darkness, then fellowship with darkness excludes fellowship with him. If we say ἐὰν εἴπωμεν; \"if any of us, no matter who he be, at any time say.\" The construction marks the supposed action as one likely to occur. The apostle includes himself in the possibility, and of course he and his readers did say that they had communion with God. By\" walking\" περιπατεῖν ´ερσαρι is meant our daily life, our movement and activity in the world (John 8:12; John 11:9, 10; John 12:35; John 21:18; Revelation 21:24); this activity will inevitably express the κοινωνία in which we live. To have communion with him who is Light, and be continually exhibiting a life of darkness, is impossible. The Carpocratians and other Gnostics, who taught that to the enlightened all action is indifferent, because neither purity nor filth can change the nature of pure gold, are perhaps here aimed at (Mansel, 'Gnostic Heresies,' pages 117-121). We lie, and do not the truth. As in verse 5, St. John enforces a statement by denying the opposite. But the negative is not a mere equivalent of the positive: the two together mean, \"we are false both in word and deed.\" Truth with St. John is not confined to language; it is exhibited in conduct also (cf. ποιεῖν ψεῦδος, Revelation 21:27; Revelation 22:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The contrary hypothesis is now stated, and the thought is carried a stage further (cf. verse 9). He again speaks conditionally ἐάν, and does so until 1 John 2:3; after which the participial substantive ὁ λέγων ὀ ἀαπῶν ὁ μισῶν represents the conditional clause. The change of verbs is significant: we walk, God is, in the light. We move through time; he is in eternity. Our activity involves change; his does not. Like the sun, he both is Light and dwells in the light; and if we walk in the light, which is his atmosphere, we have fellowship one with another. Darkness is an unsocial condition, and this the light expels. From verse 6 we might have expected, \"we have fellowship with him;\" and some inferior authorities read μετ αὐτοῦ. But St. John's repetitions are not mere repetitions: the thought is always recur or reset to carry us a step further (cf. verses 3, 4). Having fellowship with one another is a sure result of that fellowship with God which is involved in walking in the light. \"Here is a reply to those who would restrain Catholic communion to their own sect\" (Wordsworth). Another result of walking in the light is that the blood of Jesus (his sacrificial death) cleanses us day by day continually (present tense) from our frequent sins of frailty. This cleansing is not the same as forgiveness of sins (verse 9). The latter is the case of ὁ λελουμένος, the man that is bathed (John 13:10); the former is the frequent washing of the feet (cf. Revelation 7:14; Revelation 22:14). The expression, the blood of Jesus, in Christian theology, \"is dogma with pathos.... It implies, as no other word could do, the realityNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of the human body of Jesus,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) of his sufferings,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) of his sacrifice.\"NEWLINENEWLINEBy his blood new life-blood is infused into human nature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - After the great message,\" God is Light\" (verse 5) and its application to ourselves (verses 6, 7), we are now told what walking in the light involves:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) consciousness of sin and confession of sin (verses 8-10);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) accepting the propitiation of Jesus Christ the Righteous (1 John 2:1-2);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) obedience (1 John 2:3-6). If we say that we have not sin. The present ἔχομεν again shows that the daily falls of those who are walking in the light are meant, not the sins committed in the days of darkness before conversion. The Lord's Prayer implies that we must daily ask forgiveness. We lead ourselves astray from the truth, and have no right estimate of the gulf between our impurity and God's holiness, if we deny this habitual frailty. In the sunlight even flame throws a shadow; and that man is in darkness who denies his sin. The truth may be near him; but it has not found a home with him - it is not in him. Πλανᾷν is specially frequent in the Revelation, and always of arch-deceivers - Satan, the beast, antichrist, false teachers; it seems to imply fundamental error (comp. 1 John 2:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As in verse 7, we have the opposite hypothesis stated, and the thought advanced a stage. Not the exact opposite, \"if we confess that we have sin;\" but \"if we confess our sins.\" It is easy to say, \"I am a sinner;\" but if confession is to have value it must state the definite acts of sin. The context (\"deceive ourselves... he is faithful\") shows that confession at the bar of the conscience and of God is meant. Circumstances must decide whether confession to man is required also, and this St. John neither forbids nor enjoins. Note the asyndeton; there is no δέ, as in verse 7. He is faithful and righteous, Δίκαιος must be rendered \"righteous\" rather than \"just,\" to mark the contrast with unrighteousness ἀδικίτι, and the connexion with \"Jesus Christ the Righteous\" (1 John 2:1). To forgive... to cleanse. As explained in verse 7, the one refers to freeing us from the penalties of sin, justification; the other to freeing us from its contamination, sanctification. The sense of purpose is not wholly to be surrendered. No doubt ἵνα, like other particles, becomes weakened in later Greek; but even in later classical Greek the notion of purpose is mixed up with that of consequence. Much more is this the case in the New Testament, and especially in St. John, where what seems to us to be mere result is really design; and this higher aspect of the sequence of facts is indicated by ἵνα. It is God's nature to be faithful and righteous; but it is also his purpose to exhibit these attributes towards us; and this purpose is expressed in ἵνα ἀφῇ ἡμῖν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Once more we have no mere repetition, but a fresh thought. \"We have not sin\" (verse 8) refers to our natural condition; \"we have not sinned\" (verse 10) refers to definite acts. Note the climax: we lie (verse 6); we lead ourselves utterly astray (verse 8): we make God a liar (verse 10). The whole of God's dealing with man since the Fall, especially in the Incarnation, is based on the fact of man's innate sinfulness. To deny this fact, therefore, is to charge the God of light and truth with acting and maintaining a vast and persistent lie. It is difficult to see how this strong language can be reconciled with the Roman dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary: why does not her \"son\" (John 19:26, 27) except her from its sweep? His word is not in us; i.e., we are cut off from all communication with him (John 5:38; John 8:31). \"His Word\" is the sum total of the Divine revelation. That which in itself is \"the truth \"(verse 8), when communicated to us is \"his Word.\" How thoroughly the Church of England enters into the spirit of these verses (8-10) is shown by the fact that it appoints confession and absolution as part of public service every morning and evening throughout the year, as well as of every celebration of the Eucharist. As Bede points out, the Lord's Prayer itself, with the petition, \"Forgive us our trespasses,\" is a conclusive answer to Pelagian opponents of St. John's doctrine.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1John.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not.

We have just hadNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the confession that we do sin; we now haveNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the principle that we must not sin; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the consolation that sin is not irremediable. Verse 1. - My little children; or, perhaps, my dear children; or, simply, my children. The diminutive τεκνία, if it retains any force, expresses endearment rather than smallness or youth. The word occurs only once outside this Epistle (John 13:33), and it was, perhaps, from Christ's use of it then that St. John adopted it (verses 12, 28; 1 John 3:7, 18; 1 John 4:4; 1 John 5:21). In Galatians 4:19 the reading is doubtful Cf. Τί με φεύγεις, τέκνον τὸν σαυτοῦ πατέρα; in the beautiful story of St. John and the young robber (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' III. 23:17). As distinct from παιδία (1 John 2:13, 18), the word seems to imply spiritual fatherhood. These things (the section, 1 John 1:5-10) I write to you, that ye may not sin. The aorist forbids the rendering, \"continue in sin;\" as before, those who are walking in light and yet sin through frailty are addressed. Two apparently contradictory principles have been set forth: you must walk in light; you must confess that you sin. St. John now goes on to reconcile them. I writeNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to charge you not to sin;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) [to tell you that] if we sin, we have an Advocate.NEWLINENEWLINEInstead of understanding \"to tell you that,\" we may take καί as \"and yet\" - a frequent use in St. John. There are two seemingly opposite truths - sin is wholly alien from the Christian, and the Christian is never wholly free from sin; and St. John struggles to give them their right balance, not in the dialectical manner of St. Paul, but by stating them alternately, side by side, varying the point of view. We have an Advocate. The possession of the Advocate is as continual ἔχομεν as of the sin (1 John 1:8). Every one feels that \"a Comforter with the Father\" is an impossible rendering. But St. John alone uses the word Παράκλητος, four times in his Gospel of the Spirit (see on John 14:16), and once here of Christ. Is it likely that he would use so unusual and important a word in two different senses, and that in two writings intended as companions to one another? The rendering \"Advocate,\" necessary here, carries with it the rendering \"Advocate\" in the Gospel. Moreover, what is the meaning of ἄλλος Παράκλητος, if Christ is an Advocate, but the Spirit a Comforter? If Christ is one Advocate and the Spirit \"another Advocate,\" all is intelligible. Philo frequently uses παράκλητος of the high priest as intercessor for the people, and also of the Divine Λόγος. There is a difference, however, between \"Paraclete\" as used of the Spirit and as used of Christ. It is applied to the Spirit in his relation to the disciples; to Christ in his relation to the Father. Christ is our Advocate πρὸς τὸν Πατέρα: his advocacy turns towards the Father to propitiate him. And not in vain; for he is himself \"righteous.\" A sinner could not reconcile God to sinners; but a righteous Advocate can, for his character is a warrant for the righteousness of his cause. Thus, δίκαιον is the set-off to ἐάν τις ἁμάρτῃ. One who has sinned needs an advocate; one who has not sinned can best undertake the office. Δίκαιον at the end, without the article, is gently suggestive of the plea, \"Jesus Christ, a Righteous One.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And he (not quia nor enim, but idemque ille) is a Propitiation for our sins. Ἱλασμός occurs here and chapter 1 John 4:10 only in the New Testament. St. Paul's word is καταλλαγή (Romans 5:11; Romans 11:15; 2 Corinthians 5:18, 19). They are not equivalents; ἱλασμός has reference to the one party to be propitiated, καταλλαγή to the two parties to be reconciled. Ἀπολύτρωσις is a third word expressing yet another aspect of the atonement - the redemption of the offending party by payment of his debt (Romans 3:24, etc.). Although ἱλασμός does not necessarily include the idea of sacrifice, yet the use of the word in the LXX, and of ἱλάσκεσθαι (Hebrews 2:27) and ἱλαστήριον (Romans 3:25; Hebrews 9:5) in the New Testament, points to the expiation wrought by the great High Priest by the sacrifice of himself. It is ἱλασμός, and not ἱλαστήρ, because the prominent fact is Christ as an Offering rather than as One who offers. With the περί, cf. John 8:46; John 10:33; John 16:8. Our sins are the subject-matter of his propitiatory work. And not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. Again we seem to have an echo of the prayer of the great High Priest (John 17:20, 24). The propitiation is for all, not for the first band of believers only. The sins of the whole world are expiated; and if the expiation does not effect the salvation of the sinner, it is because he rejects it, loving the darkness rather than the light (John 3:19). No man - Christian, Jew, or Gentile - is outside the mercy of God, unless he places himself there deliberately. \"It seems clear that the sacrifice of Christ, though peculiarly and completely available only for those who were called, does in some particulars benefit the whole world, and release it from the evil in which the whole creation was travailing\" (Jelf).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-6. - Thirdly, walking in the light involves obedience.

The token of our having this knowledge is stated hypothetically; not because, but if, we obey. To serve under another and obey him is one of the best ways of knowing his character. The knowledge is no mere intellectual apprehension, such as the Gnostic, postulated, but a moral and spiritual affection and activity. It is possible to know and hate (John 16:24). Again, the knowledge is not a mere emotional appreciation. Christianity knows nothing of piety without morality. To know Christ is to love him, and to love him is to obey and imitate him. By \"keep\" τῆρῶμεν is recant \"keep the eye fixed upon, observe.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The participial substantive ὁ λέγων now takes the place of ἐάν with the subjunctive, but the two are equivalent (cf. 1 John 1:6, which is almost exactly parallel to this, and shows what \"knowing him\" really is, viz. having fellowship with him, just as not keeping his commandments is the same as walking in darkness). St. John says, μὴ τηρῶν, not, οὐ τηρῶν, the case being hypothetical - if there be such a man, he is a liar, and has no idea of truth (see on 1 John 1:8). He must have lost the very power of recognizing truth to maintain that he knows Christ, when he habitually transgresses his commands. It is no great thing, as Bode says, to know as the devils do, who \"believe and tremble.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Once more (cf. 1 John 1:7, 9) the opposite is stated and the thought carried further. But whoso keepeth his word (his doctrine as a whole, including the separate commandments), of a truth in him hath the love of God been perfected; i.e., as an accomplished fact; the relation of love has been established. In St. John ἀληθῶς is no mere expletive; it expresses reality, and reality that is known. From verse 4 we might have expected \"of a truth he knoweth God;\" but the apostle goes beyond this, and shows that really knowing God involves loving him (comp. 1 John 4:11). The context shows that τοῦ Θεοῦ is objective - his love of God rather than God's love of him. The insertion of τοῦ Θεοῦ here, and the drift of the Epistle thus far, are in favour of αὐτόν and αὐτοῦ in verses 3-5 meaning God rather than Christ, although αὐτός in verse 2 tells the other way. The last clause sums up and reaffirms, but as usual with a new turn of thought, the whole section (verses 3-5), which begins and ends with ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν. Knowing God implies keeping his Word; and keeping his Word involves loving him; and all this implies being in him, i.e., having that fellowship with him and his Son in which the Christian's life (which is eternal life) consists, and to promote which St. John publishes his Gospel (1 John 1:3, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Profession involves an obligation to act up to the profession. \"He who says that he abides in God is by his words morally bound to walk even as his Son, the incarnate Revelation of his will, walked.\" The change from ἐν αὐτῷ to ἐκεῖνος confirms the view that αὐτόν and αὐτοῦ mean the Father; but St. John's use of ἐκεῖνος to recall with emphasis a previous subject (John 1:8, 18, 33; John 5:11; John 9:37; John 10:1; John 12:48) makes this argument inconclusive. To be or abide in God or in Christ implies an habitual condition, not isolated apprehensions of his presence. Obedience, not feeling, is the test of union; and the Christian who is really such has least to tell of \"experiences\" of special visitations. He who is ever in the light has few sensible illuminations to record. Note the strong καθώς, even as (not merely ὡς, as); nothing less than \"the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\" (Ephesians 4:13) is to be aimed at. \"Ye therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect\" (Matthew 5:48).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBrethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-28. -NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Negative side. What walking in the light excludes; the things and persons to be avoided - hatred of a brother, love of the world, antichrists. To this section verses 7, 8 form an introduction, as chapter 1 John 1:5, 7 to the positive side. Verse 7. - Beloved; ἀγαπητοί, not ὀδελφοί, is the true reading. Addresses of this kind commonly introduce a fresh division of the subject, main or subordinate. Thus ἀγαπητοί (1 John 4:1, 7); τεκνία (1 John 2:1); παιδία (1 John 2:18); ἀδελφοί (1 John 3:13). Sometimes, however, they introduce an earnest conclusion (1 John 2:28; 1 John 3:21; 1 John 5:21). In 1 John 4:11 ἀγαπητοί introduces a conclusion which serves as a fresh starting-point. Not a fresh commandment do I write to you, but an old commandment. Where it can be conveniently done, it is worth while distinguishing καινός, \"fresh,\" as opposed to \"worn out,\" \"obsolete,\" from νέος, \"new,\" as opposed to \"old, aged.\" \"New wine must be put into fresh skins\" (Mark 2:22). Are two commandments meant - one to cultivate brotherly love, the other to walk as Christ walked? Or is there only one, which from different points of view may be regarded as either new or old? Commentators are divided; but the latter seems better. Then what is the commandment which is at once new and old? The whole gospel, or the command to love one another? John 13:34 and John 15:2 will incline us to the latter view. The command was old, for\" Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\" (Leviticus 19:18) was part of the Mosaic Law. But the standard was new: \"Even as I loved you;\" \"Even as he also walked;\" and the motive was new: because \"God so loved us\" (1 John 4:11). Brotherly love, enforced by such an example, and based on such a fact, was a new command as compared with the cold injunction of the Law. From the beginning may have either of two senses:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) from of old, i.e., long before the Gospel;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) from the beginning of your career as Christians. This new and yet old command sums up the practical side of the gospel which had been preached to them from the first. The second ἀπ ἀρχῆς it spurious.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Again. The πάλιν indicates another point of view - what in one sense was not fresh, in another sense was so. It is impossible to be certain as to the meaning of ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθὲς κ.τ.λ.. It may meanNEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"which thing (the newness of the command) is true;\" orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"as a fresh commandment I am writing to you a thing which is true.\"NEWLINENEWLINEBut for the practical example of the life of Christ, and men's acceptance of it, the command to love one's neighbour might have remained old and become obsolete. Ὅτι is almost certainly \"because,\" not \"that;\" it introduces the reason why he writes, not the substance of, the fresh commandment. How can \"the darkness is passing away,\" etc., be a commandment? The light, the true light τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινόν; i.e., the real, the perfect, the very light, that which most fully realizes the ideal of light; in opposition to those \"wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever\" (Jude 1:13; cf. John 1:4, 9; John 6:32; John 15:1). Christ is the perfect Light, as he is the perfect Bread and the perfect Vine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - Walking in the light excludes all hatred towards brethren, for such hatred is a form of darkness. These verses set forth in a variety of forms the affinity between love and light, hatred and darkness, and the consequent incompatibility between hatred and light. \"Hate\" μισεῖν is not to be watered down into \"neglect\" or \"fail to love.\" St. John knows nothing of such compromises. Love is love, and hate is hate, and between the two there is no neutral ground, any more than between life and death, or between Christ and antichrist. \"He that is not with me is against me.\" \"Love is the moral counterpart of intellectual light. It is a modern fashion to represent these two tempers as necessarily opposed. But St. John is at once earnestly dogmatic and earnestly philanthropic; for the Incarnation has taught him both the preciousness of man and the preciousness of truth\" (Liddon). Verse 9. - He that saith. For the fifth time St. John points out a glaring inconsistency which is possible between profession and fact (ἐὰν εἴπμεν, 1 John 1:6, 8, 10; ὁ λέγων, 1 John 2:4.9); cf. 1 John 4:20. In all these passages the case is put hypothetically; but in some of the Gnostic teaching of the age this inconsistency existed beyond a doubt. Is in darkness even until now. His supposing that hatred is compatible with light proves the darkness in which he is. Nay, more, it shows that, in spite of his having nominally entered the company of the children of light, he has really never left the darkness. \"If ye loved only your brethren, ye would not yet be perfect; but if ye hate your brethren, what are ye? where are ye?\" (St. Augustine).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Whereas he who loves his brother has not only entered the region or' light, but has made it his home: he abideth in the light. It is difficult to determine whether the \"occasion of stumbling\" σκάνδαλον is in reference to himself or to others. The context here and John 11:9, 10 are in favour of the former. It is a man's own salvation that is under consideration here, not his influence over others: and προσκόπτει ὅτι τὸ φῶς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ seems exactly parallel. To have no light in one is to be in danger of stumbling; to have light in one is to have no occasion of stumbling (comp. Ezekiel 14:3, which is very parallel). But elsewhere in the New Testament σκάνδαλον means a stumbling-block or snare in another's way, not in one's own way; and this makes sense here. There is yet a third explanation. Ἐν αὐτῳ may mean \"in it,\" i.e., \"in the light there is no occasion of stumbling.\" This makes a good antithesis to the close of verse 11, \"knoweth not whither he goeth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Note the alternation: verse 10 is the antithesis of verse 9, and verse 11 of verse 10, repeating and enlarging verse 9. Note also the climax effected by the gradual increase of predicates: in verse 9 one, in verse 10 two, in verse 11 three. The brother-hater has darkness as his habitual condition and as the atmosphere in which he lives and works; and long ago (aorist) the continual darkness deprived him of the very power of sight, so that he is in ignorance as to the course he is taking. Cf. \"They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness\" (Psalm 82:5); \"The fool walketh in darkness\" (Ecclesiastes 2:14). \"St. John scouts all the pretences of men to illumination which do not involve the practical acknowledgment of brotherhood. A man may say he is in the light as much as he pleases; but to be in the light implies that he is able to see his brethren, and not to stumble against them\" (Maurice).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - Before passing on to the second thing which walking in the light excludes, viz. love of the world (verses 15-17), the apostle twice makes a threefold address, first stating why he writes γράφω, and secondly why he wrote ἔγραψα, to the three classes named. This suggests several questions.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) What is the difference between \"I write\" (or, \"am writing\") and \"I wrote\" (or, \"have written;\" for this is a case where the English perfect may represent the Greek aorist)? Five answers are given.NEWLINENEWLINE(a) The change is made for emphasis: \"I write; I wrote; there is nothing more to be said.\" But in this case the past tense should come first: \"I wrote; I write it again.\" Moreover, we should expect the perfect rather than the aorist, as in ο{ γέγραφα γέγραφα.NEWLINENEWLINE(b) \"I write\" refers to what follows; \"I wrote,\" to what precedes. And some have even tried to find out the three different portions in each part of the Epistle; e.g., \"I write to you, little children\" (1 John 2:15-17); \"to you, fathers\" (1 John 2:18-27); \"to you, young men\" (1 John 2:28-3:22): \"I wrote to you, children\" (1 John 1:5-7); \"to you, fathers\" (chapter 1:8-2:2); \"to you, young men\" (1 John 2:3-11). But this is fanciful and very arbitrary; and in this case also the past tense should come first: \"I have written thus far to you; again I proceed to write to you.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(c) \"I write\" refers to the whole Epistle; \"I wrote,\" to what precedes. This answer has the sanction of the 'Speaker's Commentary;' but it seems to be quite frivolous. What could induce St. John first of all to tell each class that he writes the whole Epistle to them, and then to tell them that he wrote the first part of it to them? There would be little enough sense in first saying that he wrote the beginning to them, and then that he writes the whole to them; but there is no sense in the former statement if it comes after the latter.NEWLINENEWLINE(d) \"I am writing\" is from St. John's point of view, as he pens the growing letter. \"I wrote\" is from the readers' point of view, as they peruse the completed letter. But what is gained by this change of standpoint? Is it probable that St. John would make three distinct addresses in the position of the writer of the Epistle, and then solemnly repeat them in the position of the recipients of it?NEWLINENEWLINE(e) The Epistle is written as a companion to the Gospel: therefore \"I write\" refers to the Epistle, which he is in the act of composing; \"I wrote,\" to the Gospel, which lies completed before him, and on which the Epistle serves as a commentary. This seems to be the most satisfactory explanation (see on chapter 1 John 1:4).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Who are indicated by the three classes? In the first triplet, τεκνία, as elsewhere in the Epistle (verses 1, 28; 1 John 3:18; 1 John 4:4, 5, 21), refers to his readers as a whole, of whom πάτρες and νεανίσκοι are two component divisions. This is probably the case in the second triplet also, although the change from τεκνία to παιδία renders this a little doubtful (see on verse 13).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Does the difference between \"fathers\" and \"young men\" refer to age as men or age as Christians? Probably the former. In both Gospel and Epistle St. John writes to mature and well-instructed Christians. The following table will illustrate the view taken: -NEWLINENEWLINEI write this Epistle: ? Reasons for writing it:NEWLINENEWLINE1. To all of you. ? You have been forgiven.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE2. To the old among you ? You have knowledge of the Word.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE3. To the young among you. ? You have conquered the evil one.NEWLINENEWLINEI wrote my Gospel: ? Reasons for writing it:NEWLINENEWLINE1. To all of you (?). ? You have knowledge of the Father.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE2. To the old among you ? You have knowledge of the Word.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE3. To the young among you. ? You have strength, have God's revelation in your hearts, and have conquered the evil one. Verse 12. - I am writing to you, little children (see on verse 1), because, etc. Beyond reasonable doubt, ὅτι, is \"because,\" not \"that,\" in verses 12-14; it gives the reason for his writing, not the substance of what he has to say (cf. verse 21). For his Name's sake must refer to Christ, not only because of the context, but also of the instrumental διά (cf. 1 John 3:23; 1 John 5:13; John 1:12); and Christ's Name means his character, especially as Saviour. Because they have already partaken of the ἱλασμός (verse 2), and have had their sins washed away in the blood of Christ (1 John 1:7), therefore he writes to them this Epistle. Note the perfects throughout, indicating the permanent result of past action: ἀφέωνται ἐγνώκατε νενικήκατε.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Because ye know (literally, have come to know, as in verses 3, 4) him that is from the beginning τὸν ἀπ ἀρχῆς. The context respecting Christ's Name and ο{ η΅ν ἀπ ἀρχῆς (1 John 1:1) show that the Word and not the Father is meant. A more perfect knowledge of Jesus as the Eternal Word, and no mere aeon or emanation from the Deity, is the special prerogative of the aged Christian; and such are fit recipients of the ἀγγελία of the apostle. No less fit, but for a different reason, are the younger among his readers. To fight is the lot of the young soldier; and a victorious warfare against Satan is the distinction of youthful Christians. They have got the better of that evil one in whose power the whole world lies (1 John 3:12; 1 John 5:18, 19; John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11). Not that the warfare is over, but that it is henceforth warfare with a defeated enemy. Hence they also have a right to share in the apostolic message. I wrote (or, have written) to you, children, because ye know (or, have come to know) the Father. The reading ἔγραψα must be preferred to γράφω, on overwhelming evidence, both external and internal. The second triplet begins here, and this sentence should have been given to verse 14. It is difficult to determine what is meant by the change from τεκνία to παισία. Τεκνία occurs once with μου (verse 1), and six times without μου in the Epistle, and once in the Gospel (John 13:33), the probable source of this form of address. Παιδία occurs in verse 18 (see note) and John 21:5, and nowhere else in the New Testament as a form of address. Probably both words are applied to the whole of St. John's readers. Some would limit παιδία to actual children; but in that case we should expect a different order - children, young men, fathers; or fathers, young men, children. These \"children\" know the Father to whom they have been reconciled by forgiveness of sins; they have become his adopted sons through the Name of his own Son (verse 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The address to the fathers remains unchanged; their claim to Gospel and to Epistle is the same. The address to the young men is enlarged; their claim to the Gospel is that they are strong to fight, have God's revelation of himself as a permanent possession in their hearts, and have won victories over Satan. The context and John 5:38 and John 10:35 utterly forbid us from understanding ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ of the \"living Personal Lord\" (cf. John 17:6, 14, 17; Revelation 1:9; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 20:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - Secondly, walking in the light excludes all love of the world. This is another form of darkness. Verse 15. - Love not the world. Obviously, both \"love\" and \"the world\" are used in a different sense in John 3:16, where it is said that \"God loved the world.\" The one love is selfish, the other unselfish. In the one case \"the world\" means the sinful elements of human life, in the other the human race. It is most important to distinguish the different meanings of κόσμος in the New Testament. Connected with κόμειν and comere, it meansNEWLINENEWLINE(1) ornament (1 Peter 3:3);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the ordered universe, mundus (Romans 1:20);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the earth (John 1:9);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the inhabitants of the earth (John 3:16);NEWLINENEWLINE(5) all that is alienated from God, as here and frequently in St. John's writings. The things of the world are not those things in the world which may become objects of sinful affection, such as wealth or honour, still less such as scenery or physical objects. St. John is not condemning a love of those material advantages which are God's gifts, nor of nature, which is God's work. He is forbidding those things the love of which rivals and excludes the love of God - all those immoral tendencies and pursuits which give the world its evil character. The world κόσμος is order; the things in the world are the elements of disorder - those things which arise from each man making himself the center of the world, or of some little world of his own creation. These rival centers clash with one another, and also with the one true Center. All this St. John forbids. With τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ, cf. τί η΅ν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ (John 2:25). Note the μηδέ (not μήτε), nor yet: \"Love not the world; no, nor any of its ways.\" As so often, St. John goes on to enforce his words by a negative statement of similar but not identical import. Love of the world absolutely excludes the love of the Father. \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\" Some important authorities have τοῦ Θεοῦ for τοῦ Πατρός; the balance is decidedly for the latter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He still further emphasizes the command by explaining the negative statement just made. Everything that is in the world has as its source, not the Father, but the world. This shows clearly that τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ cannot mean material objects capable of being desired; these have their origin in God who created them (John 1:3). To assert otherwise is rank Gnosticism or Manicheism. But God did not create the evil dispositions and aims of men; these have their source in the sinful wills of his creatures, and ultimately in \"the ruler of this world\" (John 8:44). The three genitives which follow are subjective, not objective. The lust of the flesh is not merely the lust after the flesh, but all lust that has its seat in the flesh (Galatians 5:16; Ephesians 2:3). The lust of the eyes is that lust that has its origin in sight (Augenlust) - curiosity, covetousness, etc. (cf. \"the lusts of their hearts,\" \"the lusts of your body,\" Romans 1:24; Romans 6:12). In the world of St. John's day the impure and brutal spectacles of the theatre and the arena would supply abundant illustrations of these ἐπιθυμίαι. The vain-glory of life, or arrogancy of living, is ostentation exhibited in the manner of living; the empty pride and pretentiousness of fashion and display. It includes the desire to gain credit which does not belong to us, and outshine our neighbours. In Greek philosophy βίος is higher than ζωή: βίος is the life peculiar to man; ζώη is the vital principle which he shares with brutes and vegetables, In the New Testament ζωή is higher than βίος is the life peculiar to man; ζωή is the vital principle which he shares with God. Contrast βίος here; 1 John 3:17; Luke 8:14, 43; Luke 15:12, 30, etc., with ζωή in 1 John 1:1, 2; 1 John 3:14; 1 John 5:11, 12, 16; John 1:4; John 3:36; John 5:24, 26, etc. Βίος occurs only ten times in the New Testament (in 1 Peter 4:3 it is a false reading), ζωή more than a hundred and twenty times. Each of the three forms of evil here cited by St. John as typos of τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ are dangerous at different periods of a man's life; each also has been a special danger at different periods of the world's history.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Seeing, then, that the love of the world and the love of the Father are absolutely incompatible, which must we choose? Not the former, for its object is already passing away; while not only does the Father abide for ever, but he who loves him and does his will abides for ever also. The antithesis, as usual, is a progress; it carries us beyond the limits of the original statement. The world is passing away like a dissolving view. It has its sentence of death in itself; its decay has begun. And even if it were not passing away, our capacity for enjoying it would none the less certainly come to an end. \"The sensualist does not know what the delights of sense are; he is out of temper when he is denied them; he is out of temper when he possesses them\" (Maurice). To love the world is to lose everything, including the thing loved. To love God is to gain him and his kingdom. Some men would have it that the external world is the one thing that is certain and permanent, while religion is based on a mere hypothesis, and is ever changing its form. St. John assures us that the very reverse is the case. The world is waning: it is God alone and his faithful servants who abide. As St. Augustine says, \"What can the world promise? Let it promise what you will, it makes the promise, perhaps, to one who tomorrow will die.\" The will of God is the exact antithesis of \"all that is in the world.\" The one is the good power \"that makes for righteousness;\" the other is the sum of the evil powers which make for sin. Abideth for ever is literally, abideth unto the age (μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα). The notion of endlessness is, perhaps, not distinctly included; for that we should rather have had εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν, αἰώνων (Revelation 1:18; Revelation 11:15; Revelation 22:5). The contrast is not between \"passing away\" and \"lasting forever,\" but between \"passing away\" and abiding till \"the age\" comes. But as \"the age\" is the age of eternity as distinguished from this age of time, the rendering \"abideth for ever\" is justified. The Jews used\" this age\" and\" the age to come\" to distinguish the periods before and after the coming of the Messiah. Christians adopted the same phrases to indicate the periods before and after Christ's second coming; e.g., ὁ αἰὼν οῦτος (Luke 16:8; Romans 12:2; 1 Corinthians 1:20), ὁ νῦν αἰών (1 Timothy 6:17; 2 Timothy 4:10; Titus 2:12), as opposed to ὁ αἰὼν ἐκεῖνος, (Luke 20:35), ὁ αἰὼν ὁ ἐρχόμενος (Luke 18:30), ὁ μέλλων (Ephesians 1:21), and very frequently, as here and throughout St. John's Gospel and Epistles, simply ὁ αἰών. In Revelation the invariable expression is εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων, the τῶν being omitted in Revelation 14:11. The exact meaning here, therefore, is \"abideth unto the age,\" i.e., the coming of Christ's eternal kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLittle children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Children παιδία here must apply to all those addressed in the Epistle; and this helps to fix the meaning in verse 13. It is the last hour. What does this mean? There is scarcely room for doubt. The perishableness of the world has suggested the thought of its end, and St. John goes on to warn his readers that this thought is full of meaning to them; for they may recognize the time in which they are living as the last hour by the many antichrists that have arisen. \"The last hour\" can only mean the last hour before the second coming of Christ. Nothing but the unwillingness of Christians to admit that an apostle, and especially the Apostle St. John, could seem to be much in error about the nearness of the day of judgment, could have raised a question about language so plain. All explanations about its signifying the Christian dispensation, or the nearness of St. John's death, or the nearness of the destruction of Jerusalem, must be firmly set aside. How could the rising of antichrists show that the Christian dispensation had begun? It was Christ, not antichrist, that showed that? What had antichrists to do with St. John's death? or with the fall of Jerusalem, which, moreover, had fallen many years before this Epistle was written? Just as the apostles, even after the Resurrection (Acts 1:6), remained grossly ignorant of the nature of Christ's kingdom on earth, so to the last they remained ignorant of its duration. The primitive Church had not yet found its true perspective, and, in common with all Christians of the first age, the apostles believed that Christ would return soon, possibly within the lifetime of some then living. \"Yea, I come quickly\" (Revelation 22:20) was by them understood in the most literal sense of ταχύ. But it will not surprise those who remember Christ's very strong declaration (Mark 13:32), to find even an apostle in ignorance as to the time of the second advent of Christ. But it may very reasonably and reverently be asked, What becomes of the inspiration of Scripture if an inspired writer tells the Church that the end of the world is near, when it is not near? The question of inspiration must follow that of interpretation, not lead it. Let us patiently examine the facts, and then try to frame a theory of inspiration that will cover them; not first frame our theory, and then force the facts to agree with it. But the question in its proper place requires an answer. The Old Testament prophets were often guided to utter language the Divine meaning of which they did not themselves understand. They uttered the words in one sense, and the words were true in a far higher sense, of which they scarcely dreamed. The same thing is true of the New Testament prophets, though in a less degree, because the gift of Pentecost had given them powers of insight which their predecessors had not possessed. The present text seems to be an illustration of this truth. We can hardly doubt that, in saying, \"it is the last hour,\" St. John means to imply that within a few years, or possibly even less time, Christ will return to judgment. In this sense the statement is not true. But it may also mean that the last period in the world's history has begun; and in this sense we have good reason for believing that the statement is true. \"That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day\" is not rhetoric, but sober fact. By the Divine standard times are measured, not according to their duration, but their importance; it is their meaning, not their extent, which gives them value. What are all the measureless prehistoric aeons of the material universe compared with the time since the creation of rational life? What are the thousands of years covered by the Old Testament compared with the portion of a century covered by the New? The great crisis in the history of the world, constituted by the life and death of Christ, will never be equaled until he comes again. When he ascended to heaven the last hour sounded. There may follow a silence (as it seemed to St. John) about the space of half an hour, but (as human experience may prove) of half a thousand centuries. Yet the duration of the period, as measured by man, will not alter its essential characteristics; it was, is, and will still remain, \"the last hour.\" Even as ye heard (when ye were instructed in the faith) that antichrist cometh (is destined to come). Antichrist in this also is assimilated to the Christ; he is ὁ ἐρχόμενος. This was the teaching of the gospel (Matthew 24:5, 11, 23-26; Mark 13:22, 23; comp. Acts 20:29; 2 Timothy 3:1; 2 Peter 2:1). What does St. John mean by ἀντίχριστος? The four passages (1 John 2:18, 22; 1 John 4:3; 2 John 1:7) in which he uses the term do not enable us to answer the question with certainty. The predominant idea is that of opposition to Christ, and rivalry of Christ, rather than merely of counterfeiting Christ. If ἀντίχριστος were formed on the analogy of ἀντιβασιλεύς and ἀνθύπατος, it would mean \"vice-Christ, vicar of Christ.\" It is, however, analogous to ἀντίθεος ἀντιφιλόσοφος and the Greek for a counterfeit Christ is ψευδόχριστος (Matthew 24:24). But we are left in doubt whether this rival of Christ is a principle or a person. None of the four passages is decisive. Here we are not sure whether the arising of many antichrists proves that the spirit of antichrist is already in the world, or that by them the way is fully prepared for the one personal antichrist. Either the existence of the antichristian character, or the approach of the antichrist, is given as evidence that the day of the Lord is at hand. The latter is the more probable. A great personal opponent to the personal Christ seems to be indicated both by St. John and St. Paul (2 Thessalonians 2:1-8). The Jews expected a personal opponent of the Messiah to precede the Messiah - Armillus, Gog, Antiochus Epiphanes, and the like (Ezekiel 38:39; Daniel 7:25; Daniel 8:25; Daniel 11:36); and Christians from the earliest times have expected a similar prelude to the return of the Messiah. The term ἀντίχριστος is absolutely peculiar to St. John in the New Testament. By the ἀντίχριστοι πολλοί he probably means those early heretical teachers, who in various ways denied the Incarnation, and were thus forerunners of the antichrist - the Nicolaitanes, Simon Magus, Cerinthus, Diotrephes, Hymenaeus, and Philetus. Besides these there are practical antichrists. \"Let us mark, not the tongue but the deeds. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that Jesus is the Christ. Let the tongue keep silent awhile: ask the life. If the Scripture itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with deeds, then assuredly we find many antichrists if deeds are to be questioned, not only do we find many antichrists gone out, but many not yet manifest, who have not gone out at all\" (St. Augustine).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They went out from us ἐξ ἡμῶν ἐξῆλθαν; just as the evil spirit went out of the demoniac (ἐξῆλθεν ἐξ αὐτοῦ, Mark 1:26). But they were not of us οὐκ η΅σαν ἐξ ἡμῶν; they had not their origin with us, just as the unbelieving Jews were \"not of God\" ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἐστὲ, but of the devil (John 8:23, 44, 47). The emphatic repetition of ἠμῶν, five times in one verse, is quite in St. John's style. The \"no doubt\" of the Authorized Version, rightly omitted in the Revised Version, probably represents the utique of the Vulgate, which is a mistaken attempt to give a separate word to translate ἄν (compare forsitan in John 4:10; John 5:46. For the elliptical ἀλλ ἵνα, comp. John 1:8). What follows is not clear, and is taken in three ways:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"That all are not of us,\" which seems to imply that some of them are of us. This can hardly be right.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"That all of them are not of us;\" i.e., are aliens (verse 21; 1 John 3:15; Revelation 22:3; Matthew 24:22; Mark 13:20; Luke 1:37; Romans 3:20; Galatians 2:16; Ephesians 5:5). But in that case we should expect πάντες οὐκ εἰσίν, not οὐκ εἰσὶν πάντες.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Two thoughts are mixed together:NEWLINENEWLINE(a) \"That they may be made manifest that they are not of us;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(b) \"That it may be made manifest that not all who are with us μεθ are of us ἐξ ἡμῶν.\" This seems preferable. The renegade and apostate was all along only nominally a Christian. Of the true Christian the declaration remains true, \"No one snatcheth them out of his hand.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The thought of many antichrists suggests that of many Christs; i.e., many who have been anointed χριστοί by the Christ himself. \"The false teachers have the spirit of antichrist; ye have a chrism from the Christ.\" The Johannine καί places the two antithetical groups side by side, while the emphatic ὑμεῖς (comp. 1 John 4:4) accentuates the contrast. And ye have an anointing from the Holy One. The unction or chrism is the Holy Spirit (John 1:33; 1 John 3:24; 1 John 2:27). As Christ was anointed with the Spirit in all fullness, so each Christian is anointed with him in his measure (2 Corinthians 1:21, 22). The twenty-first 'Catechetical Lecture' of St. Cyril, \"On the Holy Chrism,\" should be read in illustration of this verse. \"In apostolic language, each Christian is in due measure himself a Christ, empowered by the gift of the Holy Spirit to announce the truth which he has learnt, to apply the atonement which he has received, to establish the kingdom which he believes to be universal\" (Westcott). The ἀπό depends on ἔχετε, not on χρίσμα. The Holy One is Jesus Christ (John 6:69; Acts 3:14; Revelation 3:7; comp. John 14:26; John 16:7, 13). It is hard to decide between three readings:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) καὶ οἴδατε πάντα, \"and ye know all things\" necessary to salvation, i.e., \"the truth\" (verse 21; John 16:13);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) καὶ οἴδατε πάντες, \"and ye all know\" that ye have this anointing;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) οἴδατε πάντες,\" ye all know - I did not write to you because ye know not the truth.\" There is evidence of a fourth variation, πάντας \"ye know all\" the antichrists. IfNEWLINENEWLINE(1) be right, it does not mean that the Christian is omniscient, but that he has the basis of all knowledge; he can see things in their right proportions. The apostle's own disciple, St. Polycarp, writes to the PhilippiansNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The first οὐκ belongs to ὅτι, not to ἔγραψα: I wrote to you, not because ye know not, etc. It does not mean \"I omitted to write to you because ye know not.\" Whatever meaning we give to the aorists in verses 13, 14 need not be retained here. There is here no abrupt change from present to aorist. Moreover, verse 26 limits this ἔγραψα to the present section. What in verse 20 is spoken of as \"all things\" (assuming πάντα to be right) is here spoken of as \"the truth.\" St. John writes to well-instructed Christians, to adults in the faith. It is precisely because they \"know the truth\" that he addresses them, especially to warn them against antichrists. We are in doubt whether καὶ ὅτι, depends upon ἔγραψα (\"and because\")or upon οἴδατε (\"and that\"). The former is better; it introduces a second reason for his writing. Some take ὅτι, in all three places as \"that\" after ἔγραψα: \"I did not write to you and say that ye know not the truth, but that ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.\" Every lie is fundamentally and ab origine ἐκ separate from the truth; and hence his readers will easily recognize lies and liars, for they know the truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Who is the liar, but he that denieth, etc.? From the lie St. John passes on to the utterer of it. \"Ye readily distinguish any lie from the truth. Who, then, is the liar?\" \"The liar\" does not mean the liar κατ ἐξοχήν, as if this denial constituted the very acme of falsehood. To deny the very existence of God is surely a worse lie. Still less can we say that \"the context leaves no doubt that 'the liar' is the same with 'the antichrist.'\" The article ὁ ψεύστης refers to the preceding ψεῦδος, just as in 1 John 5:4, 5 ὁ νικῶν refers to the preceding νίκη. The very form of sentence is the same: τίς ἐστιν ὁ νικῶν... εἰ μὴ ὁ κ.τ.λ. and there ὁ νικῶν cannot mean the victor, κατ ἐξοχήν, who is Christ, and not the believer. So that the Authorized Version is not so very inaccurate in rendering ὁ ψεύστης \"a liar.\" \"Who tells lies, if not he who denies (and says) that Jesus is not the Christ?\" This was the great Gnostic lie to which St. John's Gospel and Epistle give the answer. The antichrist is this, he who denieth the Father and the Son. \"The antichrist\" here is not the great adversary, but one having similar characteristics. He denies the Messiahship of Jesus, and thus virtually denies both the Father and Son (comp. 2 Thessalonians 2:4). This truth St. John proceeds to restate and develop.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Every one who denieth the Son not only does that, but οὐδέ doth not possess the Father. To deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Son of God, for the Christ is the incarnate Son; and to deny the Son of God is to deny the Father also, for the incarnate Son is the Revelation of the Father; and not only so, but to deny the Son is to cut one's self off from the Father, for \"no one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.\" To emphasize this great truth St. John uses his favourite motive of stating it both negatively and positively. To deny the Son is not to have the Father; to confess the Son is to have the Father (comp. 1 John 1:5, 8; 1 John 2:4, 27; 1 John 3:6; 1 John 4:2, 3, 6, 7, 8; 1 John 5:12). Note the solemn asyndeta. There is not a single connecting particle in verses 22-24; the sentences fall on the ear like minute-guns. \"Every one that denieth.\" There is no exception. Even an apostle, if he denies that Jesus is the Christ. thereby also loses all possession of the Father. The history of philosophy verifies the statement. Deism has ever a tendency to end in pantheism or atheism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-28. - Exhortation to abide in the truth and in God. Verse 24. - The οϋν of the T.R. must certainly be rejected. The ὑμεῖς placed first marks the antithesis, \"as for you,\" as distinct from the antichrists. With singular caprice the Authorized Version renders St. John's favourite verb, μένειν, in three different ways in this one verse - \"abide,\" \"remain,\" \"continue;\" thereby losing the emphasis of the repetition: \"Let the good seed abide in your hearts; not be snatched away by the evil one. Then not only will it abide, but ye also καὶ ὑμεῖς will abide in the Son, and therefore with the Father.\" From the beginning; when they first heard the gospel, as distinct from what they have since heard from false teachers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And the promise which he promised us is this, even the eternal life. Αὐτός is Christ; αὕτη looks forward to \"the eternal life,\" not backwards to the abiding in the Father (John 3:16; John 5:24; John 6:40, 54). Τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον is in the accusative by attraction to ἥν. \"What St. John would have us feel is this, that there can be no promise to compare with this - that we should share the eternal life, the life of God.... We often speak as if people were to be paid for being good; not as if the being good were itself God's highest gift and blessing\" (Maurice). The reading ὑμῖν (B) for ἡμῖν is worthy of notice. In verses 16, 17 St. John gives two reasons for shunning the world: becauseNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the world is alien to the Father;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) it is passing away.NEWLINENEWLINESo here he gives two for holding fast the truth originally delivered to them: because the truth leadsNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to fellowship with God;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to eternal life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26 resumes for a moment and concludes the section respecting antichrists. \"These things\" refers to what precedes, especially verses 18-23, as distinct from what now follows. The present participle τῶν πλανώντων indicates the continual attempt of these false teachers to lead the \"little children\" astray. Ἔγραψα, as in verse 21, is the \"epistolary aorist\" (see on 2 John 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Parallel to verse 24, but stating as a fact what is there given as a command. The emphatic ὑμεῖς again marks the emphatic contrast between St. John's readers and the antichrists. Απ αὐτοῦ means \"from Christ\" (verse 20). The indicative μένει states what ought to be true of them, and is a delicate equivalent to μενέτω (verse 24). The anointing of Christ τὸ χρίσμα αὐτου abides with them as a permanent gift, and renders further apostolic teaching unnecessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the superfluous teaching refers to the antichrists. The ideal to which the Christian must aspire is the being led into all truth by the Spirit; he will need no human teachers then (see the remarkable parallel to this in Jeremiah 31:33, and the quotation of it in Hebrews 8:10, 11). The construction in the middle of the verse is amphibolous. We may take καὶ ἀληθές ἐστὶν either as the apodosis of ὠς (\"as his anointing teacheth you... so it is true\") or as a continuation of the protasis, which is resumed by καθώς (\"as his anointing teacheth you... and is true... and even as\"). Thereafter is better. The emphatic \"and is no lie\" is thoroughly Johannine (see on verse 23). The conclusion of the verse is doubtful also. The reading μένετε is certainly preferable to μενεῖτε; but μένετε may be indicative like μένει in the first clause, or imperative like μένετε in the next verse. The latter is more probable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And now, summing up the whole section (verses 18-28). \"If he shall be manifested\" expresses no uncertainty as to the fact of Christ's appearing; the uncertainty is in the time (comp. 1 John 3:2; John 6:62; John 12:32; John 14:3). In all these cases the point is the result of the act, not the time of it. The graphic αἰσχυνθῶμεν ἀπ αὐτοῦ expresses the shrinking away in shame from his presence. The παρουσία (see on 2 Thessalonians 2:8) is introduced without explanation as a well-known belief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John2:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - This verse forms a bridge between the two main divisions of the Epistle. The coming of Christ suggests the righteousness of Christ; for it is as the righteous Judge that he is coming, and those who would not be ashamed to meet him at his coming must be righteous also. Once more (verse 27) we are in doubt between indicative and imperative: γινώσκετε, in spite of the preceding μένετε and following ἴδετε, is probably indicative. To know that God (not Christ; comp. 1 John 1:9; John 17:25) is righteous is to perceive that every doer of his τήν righteousness is a son of God (not of Christ; we are nowhere in Scripture said to be born of Christ). To partake of that righteousness which is God's nature is proof of birth from him. With ποιεῖν τὴν δικαιοσύνην, compare ποιεῖν τὴν ἀληθείαν (1 John 1:6; John 3:21). Righteousness must be shown in conduct; mere desire to be righteous will not suffice. And the conduct must be habitual ὁ ποιῶν not ὁ ποιήσας; a single act of righteousness will not suffice. Note the change from εἰδῆτε to γινώσκετε. To know (intuitively) that God is righteous is to come to know (by experience) that whoever habitually acts righteously is God's offspring.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1John.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-1 John 5:12. - 3. SECOND MAIN DIVISION. God is Love. Verses 1-24. - (1) The evidence of sonship. Righteousness. Verses 1-3. - The Divine birth is the outcome of the Divine love. Verse 1. - Behold what manner of love! Ποταπός; literally, \"of what country,\" in the New Testament always implies amazement (Matthew 8:27; Mark 13:1; Luke 1:29; Luke 7:39; 2 Peter 3:11); but, as the original meaning leads us to expect, it implies marvelous quality rather than marvelous size. Love must be taken literally: the Divine love itself, and not a mere proof of it, has been given. Ποταπὴν ἀγάπην strikes the key-note of the whole section. \"And the goal of this love ἵνα is that once for all (aorist) we have received the title 'children of God.'\" And, whatever cavilers may say, the title is rightfully ours. (The words, \"and (such) we are,\" are quite rightly inserted in the Revised Version after \"children of God.\") This is shown by the fact that the world does not recognize us as such, because from the first it did not recognize God. Had it known the Father, it would have known the children, Διὰ τοῦτο in St. John refers to what precedes (John 5:16, 18; John 7:22; John 8:47; John 10:17; John 12:18, 27, 39); it does not merely anticipate the ὅτι which follows it. In logical phraseology we have here first the major premise, then the conclusion introduced by διὰ τοῦτο, then (to clench the argument) the minor premise introduced by ὅτι, -NEWLINENEWLINEWe are children of God;NEWLINENEWLINEThereforethe world knows us not;NEWLINENEWLINEForthe world knows not God.NEWLINENEWLINEBut we must beware of supposing that every one who fails to recognize our form of Christianity is necessarily of the world. St. John invariably (but comp. Revelation 21:7) speaks of \"children of God\" τέκνα Θεοῦ, St. Paul generally of \"sons of God\", υἱοὶ Θεοῦ. The latter expression can apply to adopted sons; the former, strictly speaking, implies actual parentage. In saying κληθῶμεν καὶ ἐσμεν, St. John appeals to the conscious nobility of Christians: we have this magnificent title with its corresponding dignity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest (or, it never yet was manifested) what we shall be. The emphatic νῦν is in opposition to οὔπω: our present state is known; our future remains still unrevealed. Again (1 John 2:27, 29), we are in doubt about the construction. What is the nominative to \"shall be manifested\" φανερωθῇ, \"he\" or \"it\"? The context is strongly in favour of \"it,\" i.e., \"if it shall be manifested what we shall be;\" 1 John 2:28 seems to favour \"he,\" i.e., \"if Christ shall be manifested.\" The context must prevail. \"Our future state is not yet made manifest. We know that on its manifestation we shall find ourselves like God.\" The two things will be contemporaneous. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes the following anecdote: \"When some heathen converts to Christianity were translating a Catechism into their own language, they came upon 1 John 3:2. They stopped. 'No; it is too much,' they said; 'let us write that we shall be permitted to kiss his feet.'\" Beware of inverting the meaning of the last clause, ὅτι, ὀψόμεθα κ.τ.λ.. It does not mean that the seeing God is a proof or sign of our being like him (Matthew 5:8), but the cause of our being like him: \"We shall be like him, because we shall see him.\" God is light (1 John 1:5), and light is seen. In this life νῦν we cannot see the light of the Divine nature \"as it is,\" but only as it is reflected; and the reflected light cannot transmit to us the nature of the Divine original, though it prepares us to receive it. Hereafter the sight, \"face to face\" (1 Corinthians 13:12), of the Light itself will illuminate us through end through, and we shall become like it. Rothe takes \"like him\" to mean like Christ (Romans 8:16, 17, 29; 2 Corinthians 3:18; comp. John 17:24; Colossians 3:18); comp. Revelation 22:4; Revelation 1:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Such being our hope, based upon God's promises ἐπ αὐτῷ, of becoming like him, we must keep this prospect ever in view, and live up to it. Commentators differ as to whether αὐτῷ refers to the Father or Christ, and so also with regard to ἐκεῖνος. The best way is to take αὐτῷ as God, and ἐκεῖνος as Christ: this agrees with αὐτόν in verse 2, with ἐκεῖνος in verse 5, and with the common use of the two pronouns. It is doubtless possible, especially in St. John, to take ἀκεῖνος as merely recalling the person already indicated by αὐτός or otherwise, and make both pronouns here refer to God. At first sight this seems to make a better sequence between verses 2 and 3: hereafter we shall be like God; therefore here we must strive to become pure as he is. Moreover, it is of the Father that it is written, \"Be ye holy; for I am holy\" (Leviticus 11:44; 1 Peter 1:15, 16); and again, \"Ye shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect\" (Matthew 5:48). But the other is simpler grammatically, and preserves the logical sequence equally well. Hereafter we shall be like God. Every one who has such a hope as this will aim at becoming like God here; even as Jesus Christ has set us an example, a perfect realization of human conformity to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-12. - Sin is absolutely incompatible with Christ's work of redemption and our union with him (verses 4-8), and also with being born of God, as is shown by the presence or absence of brotherly love (verses 9-12). Verse 4. - Once more the apostle turns from the positive to the negative. Having shown what birth from God involves, he goes on to show what it excludes. \"Every one that doeth sin\" evidently balances \"every one that hath this hope\" (verse 3), and \"to do sin\" is the exact opposite of \"to do righteousness\" (chapter 2:29). Sin is lawlessness ἡ ἁμαρτία ἐστὶν ἡ ἀνομία. Both words having the article, the two terms are exactly equivalent - all sin is lawlessness, and all lawlessness is sin. Ανομία, like \"lawlessness,\" expresses the ignoring of the law rather than the absence of it. \"The law\" means the law of God in the fullest sense, not the Mosaic Law. In short, sin is defined as the transgression of God's will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Two additional reasons for the absolute separation of the children of God from sin.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) They know well that the Son of God was manifested in the flesh to put away the sins (of the world, John 1:29); not mere \"sins,\" one here and one there, but \"the sins\" τὰς ἁμαρτίας, whatever sins exist. Ημῶν, though strongly supported, is probably not genuine. Αἴρεν in itself means not \"to take on himself, or bear,\" but \"to take away;\" it expresses the removal rather than the manner of removal. But it may represent the Hebrew nasa, which combines the two meanings (Leviticus 10:17; Leviticus 24:15; Isaiah 53:12).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The Son of God was absolutely separated from sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Every one that abideth in Christ ipso facto sinneth not; for, if he sins, he ceases to abide in him. Just in so far as he abides, he does not sin. Or it may mean that be who abides in Christ cannot deliberately and habitually sin. But then would not St. John have written, \"He that abideth in Christ abideth not in sin\"? But the main difficulty is in the second half. In what sense is it true that every one that sinneth hath not seen Christ? In the main two explanations are given.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The Greek perfect expresses the present and permanent result of a past action, and is often equivalent to a present. No doubt; and all would be easy if we had only to deal with ὤγνωκε, which means, \"he hath come to know,\" equivalent to \"he knoweth.\" But does ἑώρακε ever mean \"he seeth,\" as Alford suggests as the best rendering for a version? If St. John simply means that whoever sins thereby ceases to see and know Christ, he would hardly express himself thus.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The fact of the man's sinning proves that his perception and knowledge have been imperfect, if not superficial, or even imaginary; just as the fact of Christians leaving the Church proves that they never were really members of it (1 John 2:19). This explanation is preferable. In verse 2 we were told that seeing God will make us like God; and similarly, to see and know Christ make us like Christ. Whoever is unlike Christ, to that extent has not seen nor come to know him. The best of us, it may be, have seen but the hem of his garment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLittle children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - St. John repeats his declaration with emphasis and fresh considerations; hence the repetition of the tender address (1 John 2:1), \"Little children, let no one ever seduce you into the belief that character and practice can be separated. He that doeth righteousness is righteous; for a righteous man inevitably practices righteousness.\" There are always persons who endeavour to reconcile religion with moral laxity, and in St. John's day some Gnostics definitely taught that conduct was immaterial to the spiritual man, for no external acts could defile such. \"The external acts,\" says St. John, \"prove the man's spiritual character and origin. He that doeth righteousness is righteous and is of God: he that doeth sin is of the devil.\" Note the difference between \"even as\" in verses 3 and 7. There καθώς introduces a pattern as a fresh motive for self-purification; here it introduces a comparison. Christ is righteous, and his character produces nothing but righteousness; so also is it with the righteous Christian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The contrary position given to make the statement clear and emphatic. The devil ὁ διάβολος is the great accuser or slanderer, as in Job 1 and 2 (comp. John 13:2; Revelation 2:10; Revelation 12:9, 12; Revelation 20:2, 10). The devil sinneth from the beginning ἀπ ἀρχῆς. From the beginning of what? From the beginning of sin. The devil was the first sinner, and has never ceased to sin. Other answers are: from the beginningNEWLINENEWLINE(1) of the devil,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) of the creation,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) of human history.NEWLINENEWLINESome of these are scarcely in harmony with Scripture; none, perhaps, fit the context so well as the explanation adopted. If the devil committed the first sin, and has sinned unceasingly ever since, then whoever sins is akin to him, is morally his offspring (John 8:44). There is the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the evil one, and man cannot find or make a third domain; if he is not in the one he is in the other. This verse, like John 8:44, seems to be conclusive as to the personal existence of the devil. Ακ τοῦ διαβόλου balances ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ: if the one is a mere personification of a tendency, why not the other? Both should be personal or neither. \"It is not true that St. John speaks so confidently of a devil because he was a Jew and was filled with Hebrew opinions. For once that the devil is introduced in the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets, he is spoken of twenty times in any Gospel or Epistle\" (Maurice), and not least in the Gentile Luke. With the latter half of verse 8. comp, verse 5. Christ's act in removing our sins from us destroys the devil's works; for by the manifestation of the Light (John 1:5) the darkness is dispersed and destroyed. Our sins are the evil one's works: what is sin in us is his natural occupation. (For λύειν in the sense of unbinding or dissolving, and therefore destroying - a use specially frequent in St. John - comp. John 2:19; John 5:18; John 7:23; John 10:35.) The φανέρωσις includes the whole work of Christ on earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - Sin is absolutely incompatible with being born of God, as is shown by the presence or absence of brotherly love. Verse 9. - Having stated that every one that doeth sin is of the devil, St. John now states the opposite truth, but from the other side; not \"every one that doeth no sin is of God,\" which hardly needs to be stated; but every one that is begotten of God doeth no sin, which is startling. Who, then, can be begotten of God? But the statement is similar to that in verse 6, and is to be similarly understood. So far as any man sins, his regeneration is incomplete. If the new birth from God were perfect, sin would be morally impossible οὐ δύναται ἁμαρτεῖν. The new principle of life abides and grows in him, and, under perfect conditions, it entirely prevents the old unregenerate nature from rebelling. Note that St. John does not say οὐ δύναται ἁμαρτεῖν,\" cannot commit a sin,\" but οὐ δύναται ἁμαρτάνειν, \"cannot be a sinner.\" An act is different from a state of sin. This is an ideal to which every Christian is bound to aspire - inability to sin. But to some extent this ideal is a fact in the case of every true Christian. There are sins which to a good man are by God's grace quite impossible. The meaning of σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ μένει is uncertain: eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"His seed abideth in Him,\" i.e., those who are born of God abide in God; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"his seed abideth in him,\" i.e., the new principle which he has received continues to operate in the man; orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"His seed abideth in him,\" i.e., God's quickening Gift continues to operate in the man. (For σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, in the sense of \"those born of God,\" comp. Isaiah 53:10.) But this is the least probable of the three interpretations; in this sense St. John would probably have written τέκνον. Note the tense of the concluding verb, γεγέννηται, not ἐγεννήθη: his birth from God is a fact which still continues, not one that is past and gone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The question whether \"in this\" ἐν τούτῳ refers to what precedes or to what follows is here unimportant, for both are similar in meaning; and \"in this\" may refer to both. \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\" The children of God do righteousness, and not sin; the children of the devil do sin, and not righteousness. Of course, moral parentage is meant in both cases. Nothing here lends any countenance to the view that the writer is a dualist and inculcates two principles of existence - God and the devil. All, whether good or bad, are God's creatures (John 1:3); but while all are his children by creation, some become his children spiritually also, while others become the children of Satan. St. John's \"teaching about the devil is not at all agreeable to those who dwell exclusively on the sunny aspects of the world and of life, and would shut their eyes to what is dark and terrible. They like to hear of a Being who is all-gracious and loving; the vision of one who is the enemy of all that is gracious and loving shocks them - they wish to suppose that it belongs to the world's infancy, and that it disappears as we know more\" (Maurice). The expression, \"the children of the devil,\" must not be confounded with the Hebraistic expressions, \"children of perdition, children of darkness,\" \"children of light, son of death,\" \"son of perdition,\" etc. As so often, St. John not only restates the case in a new form, but adds a new thought to it - he that loveth not his brother. This forms the link with the next section (verses 13-24), on brotherly love. Of all failures in doing righteousness this is the most conspicuous - failing to love one's brother. And who is my brother? The answer is the same as to the question, \"And who is my neighbour?\" Mankind at large. The meaning cannot be limited to the children of God. Even τοὺς ἀδελφούς (verses 14, 16) does not exclude unbelievers, still less does τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ. This is confirmed:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) By the fact that the opposite case (verse 13) is the children of the world hating Christians; the true opposite of Christians loving Christians would be the children of the world hating one another.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) By the cited example of Christ (verse 16), who died for us when we were aliens from God. Of course, if the Christian must love all men, a fortiori he must love Christians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Because the message (ἀγγελία: see on 1 John 1:5) which ye heard from the beginning is this. Not merely in the beginning, but from the beginning; it was among the first announcements, and it had never ceased to be in force. Jerome, in his 'Commentary on Galatians' (Galatians 6:10), tells us that when St. John became too infirm to preach, he used often to say no more than this, \"Little children, love one another.\" His hearers at last wearied of it, and said, \"Master, why dost thou always say this?\" \"It is the Lord's command,\" he replied; \"and if this alone is done, it is enough.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The sentence is of an elliptical form, common in language. The full sense is, \"Not that we should do even as Cain, who was of the evil one, and slew his brother.\" Cain's conduct typifies the attitude of the world towards Christians. Σφάζειν in the New Testament occurs only here and in Revelation. In the LXX and the New Testament it seems to mean \"slay\" without necessarily implying the cutting the throat of a victim. That Cain's works were evil is not stated in Genesis, but is inferred from God's rejection of him. Compare carefully the remarkably parallel passage, Hebrews 11:4. The wicked envy the good the blessedness of their goodness, and try to destroy what they cannot share. The war between good and evil is one of extermination; but the wicked would destroy the righteous, while the righteous would destroy wickedness by converting the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMarvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-24. - Hate and death contrasted with love and life (verses 13-15); generous love, which has its pattern in the self-sacrifice of Christ (verses 16, 17); sincere love, which is the ground of our boldness toward God, who has commanded us to love (verses 18-24). Verse 13. - Human nature is the same as of old. There is still a Cain, the world, hating its Abel, the Church. Therefore marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you. Here only does St. John use the address, \"brethren,\" which is appropriate to the subject of brotherly love. Elsewhere his readers are \"children\" or \"beloved.\" The \"if\" (εἰ with indicative) expresses no doubt as to the fact, but states it gently and conditionally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - We know that we have passed over out of death into life (John 5:24), because, etc. \"We\" is emphatic; whatever the world may feel about us, we have certain knowledge (not γινώσκομεν, but ἡμεῖς οἴδαμεν). The love of the brethren is the cause, not of the passing over, but of our knowing it. It proves that we have passed. And this test every one can apply to himself; \"Do I, or do I not, find the love of the brethren within me?\" A Christian can no more live without love than a plant can live without growth. He that loveth not abideth in death: he has not made the passage over. There is no accusative after \"loveth,\" τὸν ἀδελφόν being a gloss. The statement is quite general; absence of love implies an atmosphere of death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - As in 1 John 4:20, St. John passes at once from not loving to hating, treating the two as equivalent. He takes no account of the neutral ground of indifference. He that is not for his brother is against him. Indifference is hate quiescent, there being nothing to excite it. Love is the only security against hate. And as every one who does not love is potentially a hater, so every hater is potentially a murderer. A murderer is a hater who expresses his hatred in the most emphatic way. A hater who does not murder abstains for various reasons from this extreme way of expressing his hate. But the temper of the two men is the same; and it is obvious (οἴδατε \"ye know what needs no evidence\") that every murderer is incapable of possessing eternal life. It is the murderous temper, not the act of homicide, that excludes from eternal life. St. John, of course, does not mean that murder is an unpardonable sin; but he shows that hate and death go together, as love and life, and that the two pairs are mutually exclusive. How can life and the desire to extinguish life be compatible? It is very forced to interpret ἀνθρωποκτόνος as either \"destroyer of his own soul,\" or \"destroyer of the hated man's soul,\" by provoking him to return hate for hate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - The nature of love as shown by Christ, and its obligation on Christians. Love has been declared the criterion for distinguishing the children of God from the children of the devil. It remains to show what love is; and this is best seen in a concrete example. \"The Eternal Word, incarnate and dying for the truth, inspires St. John to guard it with apostolic chivalry; but also this revelation of the heart of God melts him into tenderness towards the race which Jesus has loved so well. To St. John a lack of love for men seems sheer dishonour to the love of Christ\" (Liddon). Verse 16. - In this (verse 10; 1 John 2:3)we have come to know (have acquired and possess the knowledge of) love (what love is), in that he laid down his life for us. This is better than \"We have come to know love as consisting in this, that he laid down his life for us,\" which would have been ἐν τούτῳ οϋσαν. Cain is the type of hate; Christ, of love. Cain took his brother's life to benefit himself; Christ laid down his own life to benefit his enemies (see on John 10:12). This realized ideal of love we must imitate; ready to sacrifice ourselves, and even our lives, for the good of others. The effacement of another's rights and perhaps existence for one's own sake is the essence of hatred; the effacement of one's self for another's sake is the essence of love. Christ died for those who hated him; and the Christian must confront the hatred of the world with a love that is ready even to die for the haters. This shows that the \"brethren\" here and in verse 14, though used primarily of Christians, does not exclude unbelievers; otherwise the parallel with Christ would be spoiled (see on verse 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - \"But δέ if a man not only fails to do this, but even steadily contemplates θεωρῇ another's distress, and forthwith (aorist, κλείσῃ closes his heart against him, although he has the means of relieving him, how can he have any love for God?\" The meaning is not, \"How can God love him?\" as is plain from 1 John 4:20. But possibly \"love such as God has shown towards us\" may be meant (1 John 4:10). \"The world's goods\" τὸν βίον τοῦ κόσμου is literally \"the world's means of life\" (see on 1 John 2:16, and Trench on 'New Testament Synonyms,' for the difference between βίος and ζώη. (For τὰ σπλάγχνα as the seat of the affections, comp. Luke 1:78; 2 Corinthians 6:12; 2 Corinthians 7:15; Philippians 1:8; Philippians 2:1; Philemon 1:7, 12.) The ἀπ αὐτοῦ is graphic; closes his heart and turns away from him (1 John 2:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-24. - As in chapter 1 John 2:28, St. John bursts out into personal exhortation (comp. verse 13; chapter 1 John 4:1, 7), based upon the preceding statements. He then restates the motive in a new form both positively and negatively. Verse 18. - Little children (τεκνία, the μου being spurious). This address, as in 1 John 2:28, introduces the summing up of the section. It may be doubted whether the absence of ἐν with the first pair λόγῳ μηδὲ τῇ γλώσσῃ and its presence with the second ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ indicates any marked difference, as if λόγῳ expressed the instrument, and ἐν ἔργῳ the element or sphere. This introduces a false antithesis, like \"Do not dig with a stick, but dig in the earth.\" (For the Hebraic ἐν to express the instrument, comp. Revelation 13:10.) \"Nor yet with the tongue\" is not a tautological addition. One may love in word only, and yet the affectionate words may be quite sincere; and this is a common case. People say kind things which they mean at the moment, but afterwards they do not take the trouble to act kindly. But to love with the tongue only is far worse. This is to say kind things which one does not mean, and which one knows to be unreal. Deeds are needed to complete the kind word; truth is needed to correct the insincere tongue.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - In this; or, hereby ἐν τούτῳ, here clearly refers to what precedes; and the thought is similar to that in verse 14. By sincere and active love we shall come to know γνωσόμεθα that we are children of the truth. \"The truth\" here is almost equivalent to \"God;\" and we seem to have here an echo of Christ's words to Pilate, \"Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice\" (comp. 1 John 2:21; John 3:31; John 8:23, 47, etc.). The construction in what follows contains several doubtful points:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) whether πείσομεν is coordinate with γνωσόμεθα or ἐσμέν;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) if the former, whether ἐν τούτῳ goes on to πείσομεν, or is confined to γνωσόμεθα;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) whether we should read ὅ τι ἐάν or ὅτι ἐὰν.NEWLINENEWLINEIn all three cases the first alternative is perhaps preferable: And hereby we shall persuade our heart before him (that we are of the truth, and therefore have nothing to fear), whereinsoever our heart condemn us. But on the third point see Dr. Field's note in 'Otium Norvicense,' pars 3. Before him is very emphatic; it is in God's sight that the children of the truth are able to quiet their hearts, not merely in their own eyes. (For πείθω used absolutely, comp. Matthew 28:14; Acts 12:20; 2 Corinthians 5:11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Our heart means our conscience, not the affections, which would be σπάγχνα (verse 17). If we are conscious of sincere and habitual love, this will calm us when conscience reproaches us (comp. 1 John 1:9; 1 John 2:1, 2). St. John never uses the more technical term συνείδησις, which occurs in the Acts and 1 Peter, and is very frequent in St. Paul. God is greater than our heart. It is asked whether this means that he is more merciful or more rigorous. Neither the one nor the other. It means that, although our conscience is not infallible, God is. Our hearts may be deceived; he cannot be. He knoweth all things. An awful thought for the impenitent, a blessed and encouraging thought for the penitent, He knows our sins; but he also knows our temptations, our struggles, our sorrow, and our love.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Beloved (1 John 2:7; 1 John 3:2), there is a still more blessed possibility. If the consciousness of genuine love will sustain us before God when our heart reproaches us, much more may we have confidence towards him (1 John 2:28) when it does not reproach us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And (as a guarantee that this confidence is not baseless or misdirected) whatsoever we ask, we receive from him. Note the present tense: λαμβάνομεν, not ληψόμεθα. Whatever the child of God asks as such, he ipso facto obtains (John 15:7). This is the ideal condition of things; for the child of God cannot ask what displeases his Father. And we are his children \"because we keep his commandments.\" The ὅτι must not be connected too closely with λαμβάνομεν, as if our obedience were the cause of God's hearing our prayers. Our obedience shows that we are such as can pray efficaciously. (For the parallelism, comp. Exodus 15:26; Isaiah 38:3.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And his commandment is this (comp. verse 11), that we should believe the Name, etc. \"Do not forget,\" St. John would say, \"what the full scope of his commandment is. It is not exhausted by loving the brethren; we must also believe in his Son: and the one implies the other.\" What is the meaning of \"believing the Name πιστεύειν τῷ ὀνόματι? We can believe a document (John 2:22; John 5:47), or a statement (John 5:47; John 12:38), or a person (John 10:37, 38); but how can we believe a name? By believing those truths which the name implies: in the present case by believing that Jesus is the Saviour, is the Messiah, is the Son of God. To produce this belief and its consequence, eternal life, is the purpose of St. John's Gospel (John 20:31); it is also the will of God (John 6:40), and the command of his Son (John 14:1). This belief will inevitably produce as its fruit that we \"love one another [present tense of what is habitual], even as Christ gave us commandment\" (John 13:34; John 15:12, 17). Throughout the Epistle, and especially in this passage (verses 22-24), the references to Christ's farewell discourses in the Gospel are frequent. Here the main ideas of those discourses are represented - obedience to the Divine commands, particularly as to faith and love; promised answer to prayer, abiding in God; the gift of the Spirit (see on 1 John 4:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - We are again in doubt as to whether αὐτοῦ and αὐτός refer to God the Father or to Christ. The former seems better on account of verse 22; but the latter may be right (John 14:15; John 15:5). Compare the conclusion of the first main division (1 John 2:24-28). In this (or, hereby) probably refers to what follows; the ἐν does not disprove this, in spite of the ἐκ which follows. St. John has combined two constructions: \"In this we know... in that\" ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν... ὅτι, as in verse 16; and \"From this we know... from\" ἐκ τούτου γινώσκομεν... ἐκ τοῦ; comp. 1 John 4:6. From the Spirit which he gave us. \"He\" is probably the Father (John 14:16, 17), and the aorist ἔδωκεν refers to the special occasion of Pentecost. Hitherto St. John has mentioned only the Father and the Son; now the Spirit also (alluded to in 1 John 2:20, 27) is introduced by name as a witness and test of the truth. The sentence forms the transition to the subject of the next section (1 John 4:1-6), which is a sort of digression, the subject of love being mentioned in verse 7. This verse is said to have been a favourite with Spinoza.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1John.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-1 John 5:12. - (2) The source of son-ship. Possession of the Spirit. Verses 1-6. - Confession of the Incarnation is the assurance that the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of truth, is working in us, and not the spirit of error. The passage seems clearly to teach that there are two rival influences contending for power over the spirits of men. We must test men's spirits to see whether they are organs of the Spirit of truth or of the spirit of error. Verse 1. - Beloved (as in 1 John 2:28 and 1 John 3:18, the apostle again breaks out with a personal appeal into an earnest exhortation suggested by the statement just made), prove the spirits δοκιμάζετε τὰ πνεύματα. \"The spirits\" are principles and tendencies in religion: these need to be tested, for earnestness and fervour are no guarantee of truth. And to test these principles is the duty of the individual Christian as well as of the Church in its official capacity. Just as every Athenian was subjected to an examination δοκιμασία as to his origin and character before he could hold office, so the spirit of every religious teacher must be examined before his teaching can be accepted. This is no useless precaution; because, as Christ has come forth ἐξελήλυθε from God (John 16:28; comp. John 8:42; John 13:3; John 16:27), ninny false prophets have come forth ἐζεληύθασι from the spirit of error. But perhaps \"have gone forth into the world\" means no more than \" have displayed themselves\" in publicum prodierunt. There is probably no reference to the false teachers having \"gone forth from us\" (1 John 2:19). Besides Cerinthus and other Gnostics, there were the Nicolaitanes, astrologers, professors of magic, and dealers in charms, some of which seem to have had their origin in Ephesus, for they were known as \"Ephesian letters.\" Apollonius of Tyana was eagerly welcomed at Ephesus, and it is not impossible that his visit took place during St. John's lifetime.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This verso contains the main subject of the section. To confess the Incarnation is to prove that one draws one's inspiration from God through his Spirit. Know ye; or, recognize ye γινώσκετε, may be either imperative, in harmony with \"believe\" and \"prove\" (verse 1), or indicative, in harmony with \"we know\" (1 John 3:16, [19,] 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Every spirit (not so much the personal teacher as the principle or tendency of the doctrine) which confesseth not Jesus. This is the true reading, the words Ξριστὸν ἐν σαρκὶ ἐληλυθότα being a spurious addition from verse 1. As so often, St. John states the case both negatively and positively for emphasis. There is an ancient variant reading of much interest, probably of Latin origin, which can be traced back to the second century, being known to Tertullian and Iranaeus. For μὴ ὁμολογεῖ τὸν Ἰησοῦν it gives λύει τὸν Ἰησοῦν, solvit Jesum. This corruption of the text was evidently aimed at those who distinguished the man Jesus from the Divine Christ, and thus \"dissolved\" his Personality. The Greek manuscripts are quite unanimous against the reading. Is not of God; and therefore is of the evil one (see on 1 John 3:10). These professedly Christian teachers are ever among the most dangerous who treat the Divinity of Jesus Christ as more or less of an open question, or as a matter of indifference. Τὸ τοῦ ἀντιχρίστου probably means \"the spirit of antichrist,\" understanding πνεῦμα from the preceding clause rather than (quite vaguely) \"the characteristic of antichrist\" (see on 1 John 2:18, to which passage, however, ἀκηκόατε does not refer, (but to Christian teaching in general). And now it is in the world already. This is an independent statement; St. John does not say that they had heard this previously.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Ye are of God. The ὑμεῖς is in emphatic opposition to the false teachers (comp. 1 John 2:20). They are on one side, and the apostle's readers on the other, and it is from this standpoint that they are to \"prove the spirits.\" St. John knows nothing of any neutral position from which the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error can be criticized \"with absolute impartiality.\" \"He that is not with me is against me.\" This assumed neutral position is already within the domain of error. Ye have overcome them. \"Them\" means the false teachers; but in what sense have St. John's \"little children\" overcome them? He may be speaking by anticipation; confident of the victory, he writes of it as an accomplished fact (comp. John 16:33). But it is better to take the statement literally. By refusing to listen to the false teachers (John 10:8) the sheep have conquered them: the seducers have \"gone out\" (1 John 2:19), unable to hold their own within the fold. Nor is this wonderful: the one side have God with them, the other Satan. Ο ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ here is equivalent to ὁ ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου (Luke 12:31). Just as God is in believers and they in God, so the world is in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and the evil one in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The source of their character and their teaching is the world; from it they derive their inspiration; and of course the world listens to them. Once again (see on 1 John 3:23) we have an echo of Christ's last discourses: \"If ye were of the world, the world would love its own\" (John 15:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The opposite case stated again, but not in the same form as in verse 4. The \"we\" here is not the same as the \"ye\" there, with the mere addition of the writer. \"We\" here seems to mean the apostles. If it is considered \"broad enough to include all who have truly received Christ by faith,\" it leaves no one to be the hearers. \"He that knoweth God heareth us\" will mean that we hear ourselves, if \"us\" means all believers. But St. John's meaning seems rather to be that he who acquires knowledge ὁ γινώσκων of God is ready to listen to further apostolic instruction. From this ἐκ τούτου need not be confined to verse 6; it may apply to the whole passage. For the Spirit of truth, comp. John 14:17; John 15:26; John 16:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-21. - God is Love, and love is the surest test of birth from God. From 1 John 3:11, 12 St. John renews his exhortations to love, this time at greater length and in closer connexion with the other great subject of this second half of the Epistle, the birth from God. Verse 7. - Beloved (see on verse 1) The address is specially suitable where the subject is love. As before, we must not look for the chief purport of the section in the exhortation with which it opens. Just as \"prove the spirits\" is subordinate to \"every spirit which confesseth,\" etc., so \"let us love one another\" is subordinate to \"God is Love.\" (For the history and meaning of the specially Christian term ἀγάπη, see Trench's 'Synonyms of New Testament.')NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In giving the opposite, St. John again varies the thought, this time very remarkably. Instead of \"love is of God\" (verse 7), we have \"God is Love\" - a far deeper thought; and instead of \"knoweth not God,\" we have \"knew not God,\" or, as we should say in English, \"hath not known\" or \"never knew God.\" The man's not loving his brother shows that in no real sense has he ever in the past known God: he is of the world (chapter 3:1), not of God. We must beware of watering down \"God is Love\" into \"God is loving,\" or even \"God of all beings is the most loving.\" Love is not a mere attribute of God; like light, it is his very nature. As \"God is Light\" sums up the Being of God intellectually considered, so \"God is Love\" sums up the same on the moral side. Only when this strong meaning is given to the statement does St. John's argument hold, that \"he that loveth not knoweth not God.\" A man who has no idea of any one of the attributes of God, as order, or beauty, or power, or justice, has an imperfect knowledge of God. But he who has no idea of love has no knowledge of God, for love is himself. God alone loves in the fullest and highest sense of the word; for he alone loves with perfect disinterestedness. It is love which alone can explain creation. Why should a Being perfectly blessed in himself create other beings, but to bestow a blessing upon them?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The verse is very similar to chapter 1 John 3:16, \"in this\" referring to what follows, and introducing a concrete and crucial example of love. Beware of the inadequate and misleading rendering \"towards us\" for ἐν ἡμῖν. It means in us, and belongs to \"manifested,\" as John 9:3 plainly shows. We must not connect together \"the love of God in us,\" still less \"the love of God toward us,\" as one idea. \"In us\" means \"in our case,\" and the whole may be paraphrased: \"A transcendent manifestation of the love of God has been made in regard to us, in that he hath sent,\" etc. The verse might serve as a summary of St. John's Gospel. The word μονογενής as applied to Christ is peculiar to St. John; it and ζήσωμεν are the key-words of the passage. \"This is love indeed; it is his only Son whom he has sent, and he has sent him to give us life.\" Note the double article - \"his Son, yes, his Only Begotten.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Let no man think that any higher manifestation of love than this can be found. It is not in any love of man to his Maker, but in his Maker's love to him, that the real nature of love can be perceived. Note the change from perfect to aorist; ἀπέσταλκεν in verse 9 expresses the permanent results of the mission; ἀπέστειλεν here states the mission as an accomplished fact complete in itself. (For ἱλασμός, see on 1 John 2:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Beloved introduces a solemn exhortation, as in verses 1, 7. The \"if\" implies no uncertainty (see on 1 John 5:9); it puts the fact more gently, but not more doubtfully, than \"since.\" The \"so\" οὕτως covers both the quality and the quantity of the love. Καὶ belongs solely to ἡμεῖς: \"we also on our part ought to love one another.\" We should have expected as the apodosis, \"we also ought to love God.\" But this link in the thought the apostle omits as self-evident, and passes on to state what necessarily follows from it. In verse 12 he shows how loving God involves loving one's fellow-men (comp. 1 John 2:5 for a similar passage over an intermediate link).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - No one hath ever yet beheld God. Θεόν stands first for emphasis. and without the article, as meaning the Divine Being rather than the Father in particular: \"With regard to God - no one hath ever yet beheld him\" τεθεάται, stronger than ἑώρακεν. Why does St. John introduce this statement here? Not, of course, as implying that to love an invisible Being is impossible; but that the only security for genuine and lasting love in such a case is to love that which visibly represents him. Seeing that God is invisible, his abiding in us can be shown only by his essential characteristic being exhibited in us, i.e., by our showing similar self-sacrificing love Ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ can scarcely mean God's love for us; for how can our loving one another make his love perfect? Nor yet vaguely, \"the relation of love between us and God;\" but, as in 1 John 2:5, our love for him. Our love towards God is perfected and brought to maturity by the exercise of love towards our brethren in him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Almost identical with 1 John 3:24. In verses 1-7 the apostle says that confession of the Incarnation proves possession of the Spirit; and in verse 12 that love of the brethren proves the indwelling of God. He now (verse 13) goes on to say that possession of the Spirit proves the indwelling of God; and (verse 15) that confession of the Incarnation proves the same. So that these four facts - confession of the Incarnation, possession of the Spirit, love of our fellow-men, and indwelling of God - mutually involve one another. St. John does not say, \"He has given us his Spirit,\" but \"of his Spirit ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος αὐτοῦ.\" It is impossible for us to receive more than a portion; the fullness of the Spirit is possessed by Christ alone. In John 1:16 we have a similar use of ἐκ (comp. John 12:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And we have beheld, and do bear witness. The emphatic ἡμεῖς clearly means \"we apostles;\" and \"beheld\" τεθέαμεθα implies contemplation with bodily eyes, as in verse 12. The invisible God can be only \"invisibly seen\" by the pure heart. But the incarnate Son has been visibly contemplated; and to bear witness of this fact was the very office of an apostle (John 15:27; Acts 1:8). The language of this verse, as of chapter 1 John 1:1, 3, would be strained and rather unreal in one who had not seen the Christ in the flesh. Note that σωτῆρα has no article, and is not in mere apposition, but is a second predicate: \"The Father hath sent [see on verse 10] the Son as Saviour,\" i.e., to be such. \"The world,\" as commonly in St. John's writings, is specially the unregenerate among the human race.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Whosoever confesseth ο{ς α}ν ὁμολογήση. This rendering seems preferable to \"whosoever shall confess\" or \"shall have confessed.\" The exact meaning is, \"Whosoever has once for all taken up the position of confessing.\" Verse 14 gave the case of the apostles; this gives that of those who accept their witness. In the next verse we have that of both together.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And we have come to know and believe. Both perfects are virtually presents, expressing the present continuance of a condition begun in the past: \"We know and continue to believe.\" Experience and faith are intimately connected; and sometimes the one precedes, sometimes the other (John 6:69). As in verse 9 ἐν ἡμῖν should be rendered in us, not \"to us\" or \"toward us;\" and here also the interpretation, \"in our case,\" is certainly possible, and perhaps safer. But the meaning may be that the object of our knowledge and faith is that portion of his own love which God has in us. It is \"in us,\" and is exercised towards him and our brethren, but in reality it is his - it is himself abiding in us. In either case love is the object of our faith. Thus love is not only the true note of the Church (John 13:35), it is also the Church's creed. The second half of the verse restates the main proposition of this section with a view to further development.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHerein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - This verse raises various questions which can scarcely be answered with certainty. Does \"herein\" ἐν τούτῳ look back to verse 16? or forwards to \"that\" ἵνα? or forwards to \"because\" ὅτι? Again, does \"with us\" μεθ ἡμῶν belong to \"is made perfect\" τετελείωται? or to \"love\" ἡ ἀγάπη? John 15:8 inclines us to refer \"herein\" to \"that\" ἵνα; and \"with us\" or \"among us\" goes better with the verb than with the subject: \"Herein has love reached its perfection among us Christians, i.e., in the Church, that we have confidence in the day of judgment.\" This is the perfection of love to have no fear. The ὅτι, introduces the reason for this confidence: its basis is our likeness to Christ. especially in being united to the Father (John 17:21, 23, 26). Compare \"even as he is pure\" (1 John 3:3), and \"even as he is righteous\" (1 John 3:7): καθὼς ἐκεῖνος in all three cases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Love implies attraction, fear repulsion; therefore fear exists not in love. Love here means the principle of love in general; it must not be limited to God's love to us, or our love to God, or our love of the brethren. Love and fear coexist only where love is not yet perfect. Perfect love will absolutely exclude fear as surely as perfect union excludes all separation. It is self-interested love that fears; pure and unselfish love has no fear. Yet nothing but perfect love must be allowed to cast out fear. Otherwise this text might be made an excuse for taking the most unwarrantable liberties with Almighty God. To cease to fear without attaining to perfect love is to be irreverent and presumptuous. Hence the apostle is once more pointing out an ideal to which Christians must aspire, but to which no one attains in this life. There is a fear, as Bede points out, which prepares the way for love, and which comes only to depart again when its work is done. Because fear hath punishment. Κόλασις must not be rendered indefinitely \"suffering\" or \"torment\" (Matthew 25:46; Ezekiel 43:11; Wisd. 11:14; 2 Macc. 4:38). But κόλασιν ἔχει does not mean \"deserves\" or \"will receive punishment,\" but quite literally \"has it.\" It is the day of judgment and fear in reference to that day that is under consideration; and fear of punishment is in itself punishment by anticipation. Note the ἀλλά and the δέ, introducing a contrary and then a contrast back again: \"There is no fear in love; nay, perfect love casteth out fear: but he that habitually feareth [present participle] is not made perfect in love.\" The dread of punishment may deter men from sin; but it cannot lead them to righteousness. For that we need either the sense of duty or the feeling of love.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe love him, because he first loved us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - We love. The αὐτόν is spurious, and is not to be understood: the love is again quite general. \"We have this principle of love.\" To take ἀγαπῶμεν as subjunctive in the sense \"let us love\" is less forcible. St. John states as a fact what ought to be a fact. \"We Christians do not fear, but love. Yet this is no credit to us. After God's love in giving his Son for us it would be monstrous not to love.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Ebrard and others make a new section begin here; but verses 21, 22 are in intimate connexion with what precedes. What is this love of which the apostle has been speaking? Is it the love of' God or of our fellow-men? Both; love of our brethren is organically bound up with love of God. To love God and hate one's brother is impossible. Sight, though not necessary to affection, aids it; and it is therefore easier to love men than God. If a man fails in the easier, will he succeed in the harder? Moreover, to hate one's brother is to hate God. \"Whoso rejecteth you rejecteth me, and whoso rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.\" Note the negative, μή not οὐ. St. John has no definite person in view as ὁ οὐκ ἀγαπῶν, but any one who may happen to be of such a character, ὁ μὴ ἀγαπην. As before, ὁ μὴ ἀγαπῶν and ὁ μισῶν are treated as equivalent; there is no neutral term between \"love\" and \"hate.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - That he who loveth God love his brother also. This is the great commandment, on which hang all the Law and the prophets (Matthew 22:37, 39; Luke 10:27; John 13:34), and, whatever we may think of the relation between seeing and loving, there is the Divine command to love, not only the invisible God, but the visible brother in whom the invisible God dwells. Sight may hinder as well as help; it is hard to love what is squalid and hideous. In such cases let us remember the Divine command; let us remember the Divinity which even the most debased humanity contains.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1John.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - Faith is the source of love. Verse 1. - The verse is a sorites. To believe in the Incarnation involves birth from God. To be born of God involves loving God. To love God involves loving his children. Therefore to believe in the Incarnation involves loving God's children. Τὸν γεγεννημένον ἐξ αὐτοῦ is not to be understood as meaning Christ to the exclusion of Christians; it means any son of God, as the next verse shows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Another mark by which we can test our love towards the brethren. In verse 1 faith in the Incarnation is shown to involve this love. Here obedience to God is the test. To obey God proves love to him, and this again involves love of his children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Reason for the preceding statement. \"For the love of God consists in this (1 John 4:17), that we keep his commandments: and these are not grievous.\" These are the words, not merely of an inspired apostle, but of an aged man, with a wide experience of life and its difficulties. \"Difficult\" is a relative term, depending upon the relation between the thing to be done and the powers of the doer of it. The Christian, whose will is united with the will of God, will not find obedience to that will a task.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Reason for the preceding statement: the opposition which causes the difficulty is already overcome. Nothing, however, is gained by transferring the full stop from the end of verse 3 to the middle of verse 4, any more than from the end of verse 2 to the middle of verse 3. The punctuation of the Authorized Version and the Revised Version is to be preferred. It is the world that hinders obedience to God's commandments and makes them seem grievous. But everywhere God's children πᾶν τὸ γεγεννημένον, as in John 6:37, 39; John 17:2) conquer the world, and that by means of faith. The aorist ἡ νικήσασα marks the victory as already won and complete: \"the victory that hath vanquished the world is this - our faith.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - What other way is there of conquering the world? And how can he who believes fail? Belief in Christ unites us to him, and gives us a share in his victories; and he has overcome the world (John 16:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-12. - The section takes a new turn; the test of the Christian life furnished by the witness of the life itself. This witness is that of the Spirit (verse 6), identical with that of God (verse 9), and possessed by every believer (verse 10). Few passages of Scripture have produced such a mass of widely divergent interpretation. Verse 6. - This (Son of God) is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ. This may be regarded as one of the main propositions of the Epistle - that the eternal Son of God is identical with the historic Person, Jesus. Of the water and the blood widely differing interpretations have been given. It would be tedious and unprofitable to enumerate them. Our estimate of John 19:34, \"the most perplexing incident in the Gospel,\" will probably influence our interpretation of this \"the most perplexing passage in the Epistle.\" Not that we have here any direct reference to the piercing of Christ's side, and its results. Yet both passages teach similar spiritual truths, viz. the ideas which underlie the two sacraments, and teach them by reference to facts in the life and death of Jesus Christ. But the facts are not the same in each case. It is difficult to believe that this passage contains any definite and immediate allusion to John 19:34. Why in that case the marked change of order, \"water and blood\" instead of \"blood and water\"? And if it be thought that this is explained by saying that the one is \"the ideal, mystical, sacramental, subjective order,\" the ether \"the historical and objective order,\" and that \"the first is appropriately adopted in the Epistle, the second in the Gospel,\" we are not at the end of our difficulties. If St. John is here referring to the effusions from Christ's dead body, what can be the meaning of \"not in water only, but in water and blood\"? It was the water, not the blood, that was specially astonishing. And \"in\" in this case seems a strange expression to use. We should have expected rather, \"not shedding blood only, but blood and water.\" Moreover, how can blood and water flowing from the Lord's body be spoken of his \"coming through water and blood\"? The simplest interpretation is that which refers ὕδωρ to the baptism of water to which he himself submitted, and which he enjoined upon his disciples, and αῖμα to the baptism of blood to which he himself submitted, and which raised the baptism of water from a sign into a sacrament. John came baptizing in water only ἐν ὕδατι βαπτίζων (John 1:31, 33). Jesus came baptizing in water and blood, i.e., in water which washed away sin through the efficacy of his blood. This interpretation explains the marked change of preposition. Jesus effected his work through the baptisms of water and blood; and it is by baptism in these elements that he comes to his followers. Moreover, this interpretation harmonizes with the polemical purpose of the Epistle, viz. to confute the errors of Cerinthus. Cerinthus taught that the Divine Logos or Christ descended upon Jesus at the baptism, and departed again when Jesus was arrested; so that a mere man was born of Mary, and a mere man suffered on the cross. St. John assures us that there was no such severance. The Divine Son Jesus Christ came not by water only at his baptism, but by blood also at his death. Besides these two abiding witnesses, there is yet a third still more convincing. And there is the Spirit that beareth witness (to the Divinity of Christ); because the Spirit is the truth. There can be no higher testimony than that of the truth itself (John 14:17; John 15:26; John 16:13). It is surprising that any one should propose to translate, \"The Spirit is that which is witnessing that the Spirit is the truth.\" What has this to do with the context?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For those who bear witness are three, and thus constitute full legal testimony (Deuteronomy 17:6; Deuteronomy 19:15; Matthew 18:16; 2 Corinthians 13:1). It will be assumed here, without discussion, that the remainder of this verse and the first clause of verse 8 are spurious. Words which are not contained in a single Greek uncial manuscript, nor in a single Greek cursive earlier than the fourteenth century (the two which contain the passage being evidently translated from the Vulgate), nor are quoted by a single Greek Father during the whole of the Trinitarian controversy, nor are found in any authority until late in the fifth century, cannot be genuine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - When all three witnesses are enumerated together, the Spirit naturally comes first. He is a living and a Divine witness, independent of the two facts of the baptism and the Passion, which concur with him in testifying that the Son of God is Jesus Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - An argument a fortiori. If we receive expresses no doubt, but states an admitted fact gently (see 1 John 4:11; and comp. John 7:23; John 10:35; John 13:14). \"If we accept human witness [and, of course, we do], we must accept Divine witness [and, therefore, must believe that the Son of God is Jesus Christ]; for the witness of God consists in this, that he has borne witness concerning his Son.\" Note the pertinacious repetition of the word \"witness,\" thoroughly in St John's style. The perfect μεμαρτύρηκε indicates that the witness still continues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hath the witness in him. This rendering is to be preferred to either \"in Him,\" i.e., God, or\" in himself.\" The former is obscure in meaning; the latter, though probably correct as an interpretation, is inaccurate as a translation, for the better reading is αὐτῷ, not ἑαυτῷ. But ἐν αὐτῷ may be reflexive. The believer in the Incarnation has the Divine testimony in his heart, and it abides with him as an additional source of evidence, supplementing and confirming the external evidence. In its daily experience, the soul finds ever fresh proof that the declaration, \"This is my beloved Son,\" is true. But even without this internal corroboration, the external evidence suffices, and he who rejects it makes God a liar; for it is God who presents the evidence, and presents it as sufficient and true. The second half of the verse is parenthetical, to show that the unbeliever, though be has no witness in himself, is not therefore excused. In verse 11 we return to the main proposition at the beginning of verse 10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - \"And the substance of the internal testimony is this - we are conscious of the Divine gift of eternal life, and this we have in the Son of God.\" St. John's ζωὴ αἰώνιος is not \"everlasting life:\" the idea of endlessness may be included in it, but it is not the main one. The distinction between eternity and time is one which the human mind feels to be real and necessary. But we are apt to lose ourselves when we try to think of eternity. We admit that it is not time, that it is the very antithesis of time, and yet we attempt to measure it while we declare it to be immeasurable. We make it simply a very long time. The main idea of \"eternal life\" in St. John's writings has no direct reference to time. Eternal life is possessed already by believers; it is not a thing of the future (John 3:36; John 5:24; John 6:47, 54; John 17:3). It is that life in God which includes all blessedness, and which is not broken by physical death (John 11:25). Its opposite is exclusion from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Eternal life is not granted to the whole world, or even to all Christians en masse; it is given to individuals, soul by soul, according as each does or does not accept the Son of God. The order of the Greek is noteworthy - in the first half of the verse the emphasis is on \"hath,\" in the second on \"life.\" Here, as in John 1:4, the article before ζωή should be translated, \"hath the life... hath not the life.\" The insertion of τοῦ Θεοῦ in the second half of the verse points to the magnitude of the loss: the possessor has no need to be told whose Son he has.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-21. - 4. CONCLUSION OF EPISTLE; without, however, any marked break between this section and the last On the contrary, the prominent thought of eternal life through faith in the Son of God is continued for final development. This topic is the main idea alike of the Gospel (John 20:31) and of the Epistle, with this difference - in the Gospel the purpose is that we may have eternal life; in the Epistle, that we may know that we have eternal life. Verse 13. - These things I have written to you sums up the Epistle as a whole. At the outset the apostle said, \"These things we write, that our joy [yours as well as mine] may be fulfilled;\" and now, as he draws to a close, he says the same thing in other words. Their joy is the knowledge that they have eternal life through belief in the Son of God. There is considerable variety of reading in this verse, but that of the T.R., represented by the Authorized Version, is a manifest simplification. That represented by the Revised Version is probably right. The awkwardness of the last clause produced various alterations with a view to greater smoothness. The verse, both as regards construction and meaning, should be carefully compared with John 1:12. In both we have the epexegetic addition at the end. In both we have St. John's favourite πιστεύειν εἰς, expressing the very strongest belief; motion to and repose upon the object of belief. In both we have the remarkable expression, \"believe on his Name.\" This is no mere periphrasis for \"believe on him.\" Names in Jewish history were so often significant, being sometimes given by God himself, that they served not merely to distinguish one man from another, but to indicate his character. So also with the Divine Name: it suggests the Divine attributes. \"To believe on the Name of the Son of God\" is to give entire adhesion to him as having the qualities of the Divine Son.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And the confidence that we have towards him consists in this. The thought of knowing that we have eternal life (verse 13) leads back to the thought of confidence before God in relation to prayer (1 John 3:21, 22). This idea is now further developed with special reference to intercession for others; a particular form of prayer which is in close connexion with another main idea in the Epistle - love of the brethren.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The point is not, that if God hears our prayers he grants them (as if we could ever pray to him without his being aware of it); but that if we know that he hears our prayers (i.e., trust him without reserve), we already have what we have asked in accordance with his will. It may be years before we perceive that our prayers have been answered: perhaps in this world we may never be able to see this; but we know that God has answered them. The peculiar construction, ἐάν with the indicative, is not uncommon in the New Testament as a variant reading. It seems to be genuine in Luke 19:40 and Acts 8:31 with the future indicative, and in 1 Thessalonians 3:8 with the present. Here the reading is undisputed. Of course, οἴδαμεν is virtually present; but even the past tenses of the indicative are sometimes found after ἐάν (see Winer, pages 369, 370; see also Trench, 'On the Authorized Version of the New Testament,' page 61).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - How does this position respecting God's hearing our prayers affect the question of intercession for the salvation of others, and especially of an erring brother? If any prayer can be made with confidence of success, surely it is this. It is an unselfish prayer; a prayer of love. It is also a prayer in harmony with God's will; a prayer for the extension of his kingdom. St. John points out that this reasonable expectation has limits. The prayer of one human being can never cancel another's free-will. If God's will does not override man's will, neither can a fellow-man's prayer. When a human will has been firmly and persistently set in opposition to the Divine will, our intercession will be of no avail. And this seems to be the meaning of \"sin unto death; \"willful and obstinate rejection of God's grace and persistence in unrepented sin. \"Death\" corresponds to the life spoken of above; and if the one is eternal (verse 13), so is the other. Sins punished with loss of life in this world, whether by human law or by Divine retribution, cannot be meant. Christians have before now suffered agonies of mind, fearing that they have committed what they suppose to be the \"sin unto death.\" Their fear is evidence that they have not committed any such sin. But if they despair of pardon, they may come near to it. There are certain statements made respecting this mysterious passage against which we must be on our guard. It is laid down as a canon of interpretation that the sin unto death is one which can be known, which can be recognized as such by the intercessor. St. John neither says nor implies this. He implies that some sins may be known to be not unto death. Again, it is asserted that he forbids us to pray concerning sin which is unto death. The apostle is much more reserved. lie encourages us to intercede for a sinning brother with full confidence of success. But there is a limit to this. The sinner may be sinning unto death; and in that case St. John cannot encourage us to pray. Casuistical classifications of sins under the heads of mortal and venial have been based upon this passage. It lends no authority to such attempts; and they have worked untold mischief in the Church. The apostle tells us that the distinction between mortal and venial exists; but he supplies us with no test by which one man can judge another in this respect. By pointedly abstaining from making any classification of sins into mortal and venial, he virtually condemns the making. What neither he nor St. Paul ventured to do we may well shrink from doing. The same overt act may be mortal sin in one case and not in another. It is the attitude of mind with which the sinner contemplates his act before and after commission that makes all the difference; and how seldom can this be known to his fellow-men! The change from αἰτεῖν to ἐρωτᾷν is noteworthy. The former is used in verses 14, 15, and the beginning of verse 16; the latter at the end of verse 16. The latter is the less humble word of the two, being often used of equals or superiors requesting compliance with their wishes. Perhaps St. John uses it here to indicate that a prayer of this kind is not a humble one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - All unrighteousness is sin. \"Among the faithful this ought to be an indubitable truth, that whatever is contrary to God's Law is sin, and in its nature mortal; for where there is a transgression of the Law, there is sin and death\" (Calvin). But this terrifying truth brings with it a word of encouragement. For if all unrighteousness without exception is sin, it follows that not every sin is unto death. It is incredible that the slightest departure from righteousness should involve eternal damnation (see notes on chapter 1 John 1:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-21. - With three solemn asseverations and one equally solemn charge the Epistle is brought to a close. \"Can we be certain of any principles in ethics? St. John declares that we can. He says that he has not been making probable guesses about the grounds of human actions, the relations of man to God, the nature of God himself. These are firings that he knows. Nay, he is not content with claiming this knowledge himself. He uses the plural pronoun; he declares that his disciples, his little children, know that which he knows\" (Maurice). Verse 18. - We know; οἴδαμεν, as in 1 John 3:2, 14, and John 21:24, which should be compared with this passage. These expressions of Christian certitude explain the undialectical character of St. John's Epistles as compared with those of St. Paul. What need to argue and prove when both he and his readers already knew and believed? We must have \"begotten\" in both clauses, as in the Revised Version, not \"born\" in one and \"begotten\" in the other, as in the Authorized Version. In the Greek there is a change of tense ὁ γεγεννημένος and ὁ γεννηθείς, but no change of verb. The whole should run, \"We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not, but the Begotten of God keepeth him.\" For the perfect participle, comp. 1 John 3:9; 1 John 5:1, 4; 1 John 3:6, 8: it expresses him who has come to be, and still continues to be, a son of God. The aorist participle occurs nowhere else in St. John: it expresses him who, without relation to time past or present, is the Son of God. The reading αὐτόν is preferable to ἑαυτόν. The Vulgate has conservat eum, not conserver seipsum, which Calvin adopts. The eternal Son of the Father preserves the frail children of the Father from the common foe, so that the evil one toucheth them not. The verb for \"touch ἅπτεσθαι is the same as in \"Touch me not\" (John 20:17). In both cases \"touch\" is somewhat too weak a rendering; the meaning is rather, \"lay hold of,\" \"hold fast.\" The Magdalene wished, not merely to touch, but to hold the Lord fast, so as to have his bodily presence continually. And here the meaning is that, though the evil one may attack the children of God, yet he cannot get them into his power.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Omit the \"and\" before \"we know.\" There is no καί or δέ in the true text; and the asyndeton is impressive. The whole world lieth in the evil one. This is the second great fact of which Christians have certainty. They, as children of God, and preserved from the evil one by his Son, have nothing to do with the world, which still lies in the power of the evil one. That \"the evil\" τῷ πονηρῷ is here not neuter but masculine is evident from the context, as well as from 1 John 2:13, 14; 1 John 4:4. \"By saying that it lieth in the evil one (in maligno) he represents it as being under the dominion of Satan. There is, therefore, no reason why we should hesitate to shun the world, which contemns God and delivers up itself into the bondage of Satan; nor is there any reason why we should fear its enmity, because it is alienated from God\" (Calvin).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And we know. The \"and\" δέ is here rightly given - it sums up the whole with a final asseveration. Whatever the world and its philosophy chooses to assert, Christians know that the Son of God has come in the flesh, and has endowed them with mental faculties capable of attaining to a knowledge of the true God. The Christian's certainty is not fanaticism or superstition; he is \"ready always to give answer to every man that asketh a reason concerning the hope that is in him\" (1 Peter 3:15); by the gift of Christ he is able to obtain an intelligent knowledge of him who is indeed God. \"Him that is true\" does not mean God, who is not, like the devil, a liar, but \"very God,\" as opposed to the idols against which St. John goes on to warn them. The Greek is ἀληθινός, not ἀληθής. Thus the Epistle ends as it began, with a fulfillment of Christ's prayer. In chapter 1 John 1:3 we had, \"That ye also may have fellowship with us,\" which is identical with \"That they may be one, even as we are\" (John 17:11). And here we have, \"That we know him that is true,\" which coincides with \"That they should know thee the only true God\" (John 17:3). This prayer of the great High Priest is fulfilled. \"We are in him that is true,\" says the apostle, \"(by being) in his Son Jesus Christ.\" This is the true God, and eternal life. Does \"this\" refer to God or to Christ? We must be content to leave the question open; both interpretations make excellent sense, and none of the arguments in favour of either are decisive. The question is not important. \"That Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,\" who was with the Father from all eternity, is the very foundation of St. John's teaching in Gospel and Epistles; and it is not of much moment whether this particular text contains the doctrine of the Divinity of Christ or not. But if, with St. Athanasius, we interpret \"this\" of Christ, the conclusion of the letter is brought into striking harmony with the opening of it, in which (1 John 1:2) Christ is spoken of as \"the Eternal Life which was with the Father, and was manifested to us.\" Moreover, we obtain a striking contrast with what follows. \"This Man, Jesus Christ, is the true God: it is no idolatry to worship him. Whosoever says that he is not God makes us idolaters. But idolatry is to us an abomination.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1John5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLittle children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Keep yourselves from idols; or, guard yourselves from the idols. In verse 18 we had τηρεῖ; here the verb is φυλάξατε. The aorist, rather than the present imperative, is used to make the command more forcible, although the guarding is not momentary, but will have to continue (Compare μείνατε ἐν ἐμοί, John 15:4; τὰς ἐντολὰς τὰς ἐμὰς τηρήσατε John 14:15). What is the meaning of \"the idols\" τῶν εἰδώλων here? In answering this question it will be well to hold fast to the common canon of exegesis, that where the literal interpretation makes good sense, the literal interpretation is probably right. Here the literal interpretation makes excellent sense. Ephesus was famous for its idols. To be \"temple-keeper of the great Artemis\" (Acts 19:35) was its pride. The moral evils which had resulted from the abuse of the right of sanctuary had caused the Roman senate to cite the Ephesians and other states to submit their charters to the government for inspection. Ephesus had been the first to answer to the summons, and had strenuously defended its claims. It was famous, moreover, for its charms and incantations; and folly of this kind had found its way into the Christian Church (Acts 19:13-20). As so often happens with converts from a religion full of gross superstition, a good many of the superstitious observances survived the adoption of Christianity. With facts such as these before us, we can hardly be wrong in interpreting \"the idols\" quite literally. The apostle's \"little children\" could not live in Ephesus without coming constantly in contact with these polluting but attractive influences. They must have absolutely nothing to do with them: \"Guard yourselves and abjure ἀπό them.\" Of course, this literal interpretation places no limit on the application of the text. To a Christian anything is an idol which usurps the place of God in the heart, whether this be a person, or a system, or a project, or wealth, or what not. All such usurpations come within the sweep of the apostle's injunction, \"Guard yourselves from your idols.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
