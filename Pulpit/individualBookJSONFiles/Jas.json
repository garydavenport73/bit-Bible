{"Jas.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJames, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - SALUTATION. James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. (On the person who thus describes himself, see the Introduction.) It is noteworthy that he keeps entirely out of sight his natural relationship to our Lord, and styles himself simply \"a bond-servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ.\" That, and that alone, gave him a right to speak and a claim to be heard. Δοῦλος is similarly used by St. Paul in Romans 1:1; Philippians 1:1; Titus 1:1 by St. Peter in 2 Peter 1:1; and by St. Jude ver. 1. It is clearly an official designation, implying that his office is one \"in which, not his own will, not the will of other men, but only of God and of Christ, is to be performed\" (Huther). To the twelve tribes, etc. Compare the salutation in Acts 15:23, which was also probably written by St. James: \"The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Ξαίρειν is common to both, and not found elsewhere in apostolic greet-tugs. (It is used by Ignatius in the opening of all his epistles except that to the Philadelphians.)NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The letter in the Acts is addressed to Gentile communities in definite regions; St. James's Epistle, to Jews of the dispersion. So also his contemporary Gamaliel wrote \"to the sons of the dispersion in Babylonia, and to our brethren in Media, and to all the dispersion of Israel\" (Frankel, 'Monatsschrift,' 1853, p. 413). Ταῖς δώδεκα φύλαις (cf. δωδεκάφυλον in Acts 26:7; Clem., 'Rom,' l, § 55; 'Prefer. Jacob.,' c.i.). Such expressions are important as tending to show that the Jews were regarded as representing, not simply the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, but the whole nation, including those so often spoken of as \"the lost tribes\" (cf. 1 Esdr. 7:8). Διασπορᾷ. The abstract put for the concrete. It is the word used by the LXX. for the \"dispersion\" (2 Macc. 1:27; Jud. 5:19; cf. Deuteronomy 28:25, etc.), i.e. the Jews \"so scattered among the nations as to become the seed of a future harvest\" (Westcott on St. John 7:35). (On the importance of the dispersion as preparing the way for Christianity, see the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 44:1.) It was divided into three great sections:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the Babylonian, i.e. the original dispersion;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the Syrian, dating from the Greek conquests in Asia, Seleucus Nicator having transplanted largo bodies of Jews from Babylonia to the capitals of his Western provinces;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the Egyptian, the Jewish settlements in Alexandria, established by Alexander and Ptolemy I., and thence spreading along the north coast of Africa. To these we should, perhaps, add a fourth -NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the Roman, consequent upon the occupation of Jerusalem by Pompey, B.C. 63. All these four divisions were represented in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (see Acts 2:8-11) - a fact which will help to account for St. James's letter. The whole expression, \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad,\" makes it perfectly clear that St. James is writingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to Jews, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to those beyond the borders of Palestine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-18. - THE SUBJECT OF TEMPTATION. This section may be subdivided as follows: -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The value of temptation (vers. 2-4).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Digression suggested by the thought 'of perfection (vers. 5-11).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Return to the subject of temptation (vers. 12-18). Verses 2-4. - The value of temptation. Considered as an opportunity, it is a cause for joy. Verse 2. - My brethren. A favorite expression with St. James, occurring no less than fifteen times in the compass of this short Epistle. Count it all joy, etc.; cf. 1 Peter 1:6, \"Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, ye have been put to grief in manifold temptations, that the proof of your faith (τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως)... might be found unto praise,\" etc. The coincidence is too close to be accidental, although the shade of meaning given to δοκίμιον is slightly different, if indeed it has any right in the text in St. Peter (see Herr, vol. it. p. 102). Here it has its proper force, and signifies that by which the faith is tried, i.e. the instrument of trial rather than the process of trial. Thus the passage in ver. 3 becomes parallel to Romans 5:3, \"tribulation worketh patience.\" With regard to the sentiments of ver. 2, \"Count it all joy,\" etc., contrast Matthew 6:13. Experience, however, shows that the two are compatible. It is quite possible to shrink beforehand from temptation, and pray with intense earnestness, \"Lead us not into temptation,\" and yet, when the temptation comes, to meet it joyfully, Περίπέσητε. The use of this word implies that the temptations of which St. James is thinking are external (see Luke 10:30, where the same word is used of the man who fell among thieves). 1 Thessalonians 2:14 and Hebrews 10:32, 33 will show the trials to which believing Jews were subject. But the epithet \"manifold\" would indicate that we should not confine the word here to trials such as those.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Patience. Υπομονή in general is patience with regard to things, μακροθυμία is rather long-suffering with regard to persons (see Trench on 'Synonyms,' p. 186, and compare the notes on James 5:7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Patience alone is not sufficient. It must have scope given it for its exercise that it may have its \"perfect work.\" That ye may be perfect (ἵνα ῆτε τέλειοι); cf. Matthew 5:48, \"Be ye therefore perfect.\" Both τέλειος and ὁλόκληρος were applied to the initiated, the fully instructed, as opposed to novices in the ancient mysteries; and as early as 1 Corinthians 2:6, 7 we find τέλειος used for the Christian who is no longer in need of rudimentary teaching, and possibly this is the thought here. The figure, however, is probably rather that of the full-grown man. Τέλειοι, equivalent to \"grown men\" as opposed to children; ὁλόκληροι, sound in every part and limb (cf. ὁλοκληρίαν in Acts 3:16). From this τέλειος assumes a moral-complexion, that which has attained its aim. Compare its use in Genesis 6:9 and Deuteronomy 18:13, where it is equivalent to the Latin integer vitae, and the following passage from Stobaeus, which exactly serves to illustrate St. James's thought in vers. 4 and 5, Τὸν ἀγαθὸν ἄνδρα τέλειον εϊναι λέγουσιν, διὰ τὸ μηδεμίας ἀπολείπεσθαι ἀρετῆς The \"perfection\" which is to be attained in this life may be further illustrated from Hebrews 12:23 - a passage which is often misunderstood, but which undoubtedly means that the men were made perfect (πνεύμασι δικαίων τετελειωμένων), and that not in a future state, but here on earth, where alone they can be subject to those trials and conflicts by the patient endurance of which they are perfected for a higher state of being. The whole passage before us (vers. 2-6) affords a most remarkable instance of the figure called by grammarians anadiplosis, the repetition of a marked word at the close of one clause and beginning of another. \"The trial of your faith worketh patience; but let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing. But if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of the giving God... and it shall be given him; but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting, for he that doubteth,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11. - Digression suggested by the thought of perfection. There can be no true perfection without wisdom, which is the gift of God, and must be sought from him. It is possible that the thought and connection of the passage is due to a reminiscence of Wisd. 9:6, \"For though a man be never so perfect (τέλειος) among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.\" But whether this be so or not, the teaching is manifestly founded on our Lord's words with regard to prayer, Matthew 7:7, \"Ask, and it shall be given you;\" and Mark 11:23, \"Have faith in God. Verily I say unto you, Whoever shall say... and shall not doubt (διακριθῇ) in his heart,\" etc. Τοῦ διδόντος Θεοῦ. The order of the words shows that God's character is that of a Giver: \"the giving God.\" His \"nature and property\" is to give as well as to forgive. Man often spoils his gifts,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) by the grudging way in which they are given, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) by the reproaches which accompany them.NEWLINENEWLINEGod, on the contrary, gives to allNEWLINENEWLINE(1) liberally, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) without upbraiding Ἁπλῶς: only here in the New Testament, but cf. ἁπλότης in Romans 12:8; 2 Corinthians 8:2; 2 Corinthians 9:11, 13. Vulgate, affluenter; A.V. and R.V., \"liberally.\" It is almost equivalent to \"without any arriere pensee.\" Μὴ ὀνειδίζοντος: cf. Ecclus. 41:22, Μετὰ τὸ δοῦναι μὴ ὀνείδιζεNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The A.V. \"nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea,\" is unfortunate, as suggesting a play upon the words which has no existence in the original. Render, with R.V., nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea. Κλύδων, the surge; ἀνεμιζόμενος and ῤιπιζόμενος both occur here only.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - The A.V., which makes ver. 8 an independent sentence, is certainly wrong. Render, Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord, double-minded man that he is, unstable in all his ways. So Vulgate, Vir duplex animi, inconstans in omnibus viis. (The Clementine Vulgate, by reading est after inconstans, agrees with A.V.) Another possible rendering is that of the R.V. margin, \"Let not that man think that a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways, shall receive,\" etc. But the rendering given above is better. Double-minded; δίψυχος occurs only here and in James 4:8 in the New Testament. It is not found in any earlier writer, and was perhaps coined by St. James to represent the idea of the Hebrew, \"an heart and an heart (בְלֵב וָלֵב)\" (1 Chronicles 12:33). It took root at once in the vocabulary of ecclesiastical writers, being found three times in Clement of Rome, and frequently in his younger contemporary Hermas. St. James's words are apparently alluded to in the Apost. Coust., VII. 11, Μὴ γίνου δίψυχος ἐν προσευχῇ σου εἰ ἔσται η} οὑ: and cf. Clem., 'Romans,' c. 23. The same thought is also found in Ecclus. 1:28, \"Come not before him with a double heart (ἐν καρδίᾳ δίσοῃ).\" Unstable; ἀκατάστατος, only here and (probably) James 3:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA double minded man is unstable in all his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - A very difficult passage, three interpretations of which are given, none of them entirely satisfactory or free from difficulties.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate [i.e. his Christian dignity]; but let the rich [brother glory] in his humiliation\" (i.e. in being poor of spirit, Matthew 5:3).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"But let the brother,\" etc. (as before); \"but the rich man [rejoices] in his humiliation\" (i.e. in what is really his degradation; cf. \"whose glory is in their shame,\" Philippians 3:19).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"But let the brother,... but let the rich [grieve] in his humiliation.\" The ellipse of ταπεινούσθω in this last is very harsh and unexampled, so that the choice really lies between (1) and (2). And against (1) it may be urgedNEWLINENEWLINE(a) that the \"rich\" are never elsewhere spoken of as \"brothers\" in this Epistle. See James 2:6; James 5:1, and cf. the way in which they are spoken of in other parts of the New Testament (e.g. Luke 6:24; Matthew 19:23; Revelation 6:15); and in Ecclus. 13:3;NEWLINENEWLINE(b) that in ver. 11 the thought is, not of riches which make to themselves wings and fly away, but of the rich man himself, who fades away;NEWLINENEWLINE(c) that ταπείνωσις is elsewhere always used for external lowness of condition, not for the Christian virtue of humility (see Luke 1:48; Acts 8:33; Philippians 3:21). On the whole, therefore, it is best to adopt (2) and to supply the indicative: \"but the rich man [not ' brother'] glories in his humiliation;\" i.e. he glories in what is really lowering. Because as the flower, etc. A clear reference to Isaiah 40:6, which is also quoted in 1 Peter 1:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Ἀνέτειλε . ἐξήρανε ἐξέπεσε... ἀπώλετο. Observe the aorists here and in ver. 24. The illustration or case mentioned by way of example is taken as an actual fact, and the apostle falls into the tone of narration (see Wirier, 'Grammar of New Testament Greek,' § 40:5, 6. 1). Render, For the sun arose with the scorching wind, and withered the grass; and the flower thereof fell away, and the grace of the fashion of it perished. Καύσων may refer toNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the heat of the sun, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) more probably, the hot Samum wind, the קָדִים of the Old Testament (Job 27:21; Ezekiel 17:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-18. - Return to the subject of temptation. Ver. 2 taught that temptation regarded as an opportunity should be a cause for joy. Ver. 12 teaches that the endurance of temptation brings a blessing from God, even the crown of life. Comp. Revelation 2:10, the only other place in the New Testament where the \"crown of life\" is mentioned; and there also it stands in close connection with the endurance of temptation. Elsewhere we read of the \"crown of righteousness\" (2 Timothy 4:8), and the \"crown of glory\" (1 Peter 5:4). The genitive (τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς) is probably the gen. epex.,\" the crown, which is life.\" Ὁ Κύριος of the Received Text has but slight authority. It is wanting in A, B, א, ff, and is deleted by the Revisers, following all recent editors. Render, which he promised, etc. The subject is easily understood, and therefore, as frequently in Jewish writings (e.g. 1 Maccabees), omitted from motives of reverence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - God is not the author of temptation; cf. Ecclus. 15:11, 12, \"Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth. Say not thou, He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of the sinful man.\" From God; ἀπὸ Θεοῦ (the article is wanting in א, A, B, C, K, L). Contrast ὑπὸ τῆς ἰδίας ἐπιθυμίας. Ἀπὸ Θεοῦ is a more general expression than ὑπὸ Θεοῦ, which would refer the temptation immediately to God. Ἀπὸ Θεοῦ is frequently used as a kind of adverb divinitus. Cannot be tempted; ἀπείραστος: an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. Syriac, \"is not tempted with evils;\" Vulgate, inten-tator malorum; R.V., \"cannot be tempted of evil;\" R.V. margin, \"is untried in evil.\" Alford has a good note on this word, in which he points out that it has but two meanings:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that has not been tried;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that has not tried.NEWLINENEWLINEThe rendering of the Vulgate is thus etymologically possible, but is against the context. The use of the word may, perhaps, be extended somewhat wider than the renderings given above would allow, so that it may be paraphrased as \"out of the sphere of evils\" (Farrar). Neither tempteth he, etc. Here the writer has in his mind the conception of a direct temptation from God. Αὐτός is emphatic. Render with R.V., And he himself tempteth no man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14 states the true origin of temptation. While the occasion might be of God \"in the order of his providence and of our spiritual training,\" the inclination is not of him. Compare with this verse the description of the harlot in Proverbs 7:6-27. Here lust is personified, and represented as a seducing harlot, to whose embraces man yields, and the result is the birth of sin, which in its turn gives birth to death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15 shows where temptation passes into sin. Ἐπιθυμία, lust, is clearly not in itself \"true and proper sin,\" but it is no less clear that, as our Article IX. says it \"hath of itself the nature of sin.\" With this whole passage we should compare St. Paul's teaching on ἐπιθυμία, ἀμαρτιὰ, and θανατός, in Romans 7:7-11. Ἀποκύειν occurs only here and in ver. 18; translate, gendereth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo not err, my beloved brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-18. - The connection of thought with what goes before appears to be this. God cannot be the author of temptation, which thus leads to sin and death, because all good and perfect gifts, and these only, come from him. Verse 16. - Do not err; better, be act deceived; μὴ πλανᾶσθε. The same formula is also found in 1 Corinthians 6:9; 15:83; Galatians 6:7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Every good gift, etc. The words form a hexameter verse, though this is probably accidental, and no sign that they are a quotation. Δόσις and δώρημα should be distinguished. \"Every kind of gift that is good, and every one that is perfect in its kind\" (Dean Scott). Δόσις and δῶρον occur together in the LXX. in Proverbs 21:14. They are expressly distinguished by Philo, who says that the latter involves the idea of magnitude and fullness, which is wanting to the former (see Lightfoot on 'Revision,' p. 77) \"Every good gift and every perfect boon, R.V. The Father of lights (ἀπὸ τοῦ Πατρὸς τῶν φώτων). The word must refer to the heavenly bodies, of which God may be said to be the Father, in that he is their Creator (for \"Father,\" in the sense of Creator, cf. Job 38:28). From him who \"made the stars also\" comes down every good and perfect gift, and with him \"there can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.\" These last words appear to fix the meaning of φῶτα, as τροπή is used in the LXX. as in classical writers for the changes of the heavenly bodies (see Job 38:33; Deuteronomy 33:14; Wisd. 7:18). Οὐκ ἔνι, \"there is no room for.\" It negatives, not only the fact, but the possibility also (cf. Galatians 3:28; Colossians 3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Begat; literally, brought forth; ἀπεκύησεν. The word has been already used of sin in ver. 15. The recurrence of it here points to the connection of thought. The offspring of sin has been shown to be death. God, too, who is both Father and Mother (Bengel), has his offspring. But how different! Us (ημῦς). To whom does this refer?NEWLINENEWLINE(1) To all Christians.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) To Christians of the apostolic age.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) To Jewish Christians, to whom the Epistle is specially addressed.NEWLINENEWLINEProbably (3). Just as Israel of old was Jehovah's firstborn (Exodus 4:22), so now the germ of the Christian Church, as found in these Judaeo-Christian communities, was to be \"a kind of firstfruits.\" The thought may be illustrated from a striking parallel in Philo ('De Creat. Princ.'): Τὸ σύμπαν Ἰουδαίων ἔθνος ... τοῦ σύμπαντος ἀνθρώπων γένους ἀπενεμηυη οῖα τις ἀπαρχή τῷ ποιῃτῇ πατρί. Transfer this from the Jewish to the Judaeo-Christian communities, and we have the very thought of the apostle. By the word of truth (cf. 1 Peter 1:23, where, as here, the new birth is connected with the Word of God). A kind of firstfruits of his creatures (ἀπαρχή). The image is taken from the wave sheaf, the firstfruits of the harvest, the earnest of the crop to follow. St. Paul (according to a very possible reading) has the same figure in 2 Thessalonians 2:13, \"God chose you as firstfruits (ἀπαρχήν);\" see R.V. margin. Elsewhere he applies it to Christ, \"the Firstfruits of them that are asleep\" (1 Corinthians 15:20). \"His creatures (κτισμάτων).\" It does not appear to be absolutely necessary to extend the use of this word so as to include the irrational creation as well as mankind. בדיה is frequently used in rabbinical writings for the Gentile world, and κτίσμα may be given the same meaning here, and perhaps κτίσις in Mark 16:15; Romans 8:19, etc.; Colossians 1:23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-27. - EXHORTATIONNEWLINENEWLINE(1) TO HEAR RATHER THAN TO SPEAK,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) NOT ONLY TO HEAR, BUT ALSO TO DO. Verse 19. - The text requires correction. For ὥστε... ἔστω πᾶς of the Textus Receptus, read, Ἴστε ἀδελφοί μοι ἀγαπητοι ἔστω δὲ πᾶς, א, A, B, C, Latt. Ἴστε is probably indicative, and refers to what has gone before. \"Ye know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man,\" etc. The verse gives us St. James's version of the proverb, \"Speech is silver. Silence is golden.\" Similar maxims were not infrequent among the Jews. So in Ecclus. 5:11, \"Be swift to hear; and let thy life be sincere; and with patience give answer;\" cf. 4:29, \"Be not hasty in thy tongue, and in thy deeds slack and remiss.\" In the rabbinical work, 'Pirqe Aboth,' 1. 12, we have the following saying of Rabbi Simeon, the son of Gamaliel (who must, therefore, have been a contemporary of St. James): \"All my days I have grown up amongst the wise, and have not found ought good for a man but silence; not learning but doing is the groundwork; and whoso multiplies words occasions sin.\" This passage is curiously like the one before us, both in the thoughts and in the expressions used.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20 gives the reason why men should be slow to wrath. Because man's wrath does not work God's righteousness δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ), the righteousness which God demands and requires.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - With the form of expression in this verse, comp. 1 Peter 2:1, \"Putting away, therefore, all wickedness (ἀποθέμενοι οῦν πᾶσαν κακίαν), and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil-speakings, as new-born babes long for the spiritual milk,\" etc. Filthiness (ῤυπαρὶαν). Here only in the New Testament, never in LXX.; but the adjective ῤυπαρός is the word used of the \"filthy garments\" in Zechariah 3:3, 4 - a narrative which illustrates the passage before us. Karts is not vice in general, but rather that vicious nature which is bent on doing harm to others (see Lightfoot on Colossians 3:8). Thus the two words ῤυπαρία and κακία comprise two classes of sins - the sensual and the malignant, Engrafted; rather, implanted. The word is only found again in Wisd. 12:10, where it signifies \"inborn.\" St. James's teaching here is almost like a reminiscence of the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:3, etc.). The \"implanted Word\" is the gospel teaching. \"The seed is the Word of God\" (Luke 8:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They are not merely to receive and hear the Word; they must also act upon it. Compare St. Paul's teaching in Romans 2:13, \"For not the hearers (ἀκροαταὶ) of a law are just before God, but the doers of a law shall be justified.\" Ἀκροατής occurs nowhere else except in these passages. Deceiving your own selves (παραλογίζειν); to lead astray by false reasonings; only here and in Colossians 2:4. Not uncommon in the LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - Illustration from life, showing the folly of being led astray. His natural face (τὸ πρόσωπον τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ); literally, the face of his birth. The expression is an unusual one, but there is no doubt of its meaning. In a glass; rather, in a mirror, ἐν ἐσόπτρῳ: cf. 1 Corinthians 13:12, Δἰ ἐσόπτρου. The mirror of burnished brass.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Observe the tenses; literally, He considered (κατενόησε) himself, and has gone away (ἀπελήλυθε), and straightway forgot (ἐπελάθετο) what he was like (compare note on ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Application of the illustration in the form of a contrast. Looketh into (παρακύψας). For the literal sense of the word, see John 20:5, 11; Luke 24:12. The figurative meaning occurs only here and in 1 Peter 1:12. Properly it signifies to \"peep into.\" See its use in the LXX., Genesis 26:8; Proverbs 7:6; Ecclus. 21:23. When used figuratively, it conveys the idea of looking into, but scarcely with that intensive force which is often given to it and for which ἐγκύπτειν would be required (see Dr. Field's 'Otium Norvicense,' p. 147). Its use in St. Peter, loc. cit., is easy enough to explain. Angels desire even a glimpse of the mysteries. But what are we to say of its use hero? Is it that, though the man took a good look at himself in the glass (κατανοεῖν, consider, is a very strong word; cf. Romans 4:19), yet he forgot what he was like, while the man who only peeps into the law of liberty is led on to abide (παραμείνας) and so to act? The perfect law of liberty; rather, the perfect law, even the law of liberty; νόμον τέλειον τὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας. The substantive is anarthrous, yet the attributive has the article. This construction serves to give greater prominence to the attributive, and requires the rendering given above (see Winer, § 20:4). The conception of the gospel as a \"law\" is characteristic of St. James (cf. James 2:8, \"the royal law,\" and James 4:11). A forgetful hearer (ἀκροατὴς ἐπιλησμονής); i.e. a hearer characterized by forgetfulness, contrasted with ποιητὴς ἐργοῦ, a doer characterized by work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Seem (δοκεῖ); seems to himself rather than to others; translate, with R.V., thinketh himself to be. Vulgate, Si quis Putat se esse. Religious (θρῆσκος). It is difficult to find an English word which exactly answers to the Greek. The noun θρησκεία refers properly to the external rites of religion, and so gets to signify an over-scrupulous devotion to external forms (Lightfoot on Colossians 2:18); almost \"ritualism.\" It is the ceremonial service of religion, the external forms, a body of which εὐσεβεία is the informing soul. Thus the θρῆσκος (the word apparently only occurs here in the whole range of Greek literature) is the diligent performer of Divine offices, of the outward service of God, but not necessarily anything more. This depreciatory sense of θρησκεία ισ well seen in a passage of Philo ('Quod Det. Pot. 'Jus.,' 7), where, after speaking of some who would fain be counted among the εὐλαβεῖς on the score of diverse washings or costly offerings to the temple, he proceeds: Πεπλάνηται γὰρ καὶ οϋτος τῆς πρὸς εὐσεβείαν ὁδοῦ θρησκείαν ἀντὶ ὁσιότητος ἡγούμενος (see Trench on 'Synonyms,' from whom the reference is here taken). \"How delicate and fine, then, St. James's choice of θρῆσκος and θρησκεία! 'If any man,' he would say, 'seem to himself to be θρῆσκος, a diligent observer of the offices of religion, if any man would render a pure and undefiled θρησκεία to God, let him know that this consists, not in outward lustrations or ceremonial observances; nay, that there is a better θρησκεία than thousands of rams and rivers of oil, namely, to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God (Micah 6:7, 8); or, according to his own words, ' to visit the widows and orphans in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world'\" (Trench on 'Synonyms,' p. 170: the whole passage will well repay study. Reference should also be made to Coleridge, 'Aids to Reflection,' p. 15). Bridleth not (μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν). The thought is developed more fully afterwards (see James 3:2, etc., and for the word, cf. Polyc., 'Ad Philippians,' c.v.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - God and the Father; rather, our God and Father. The article (τῷ) binds together Θεῷ and Πατρί, so that they should not be separated, as in the A.V. To visit the fatherless... and to keep himself unspotted. Observe that our duty towards our fellow-men is placed first; then that towards ourselves. Ἐπισκέπτεσθαι is the regular word for visiting the sick; cf. Ecclus. 7:35, \"Be not slow to visit the sick (μὴ ὄκει ἐπισκέτεσπθαι ἀῥῤωστον).\" The fatherless and widows (ὀρφανοὺς καὶ χήρας). These stand here (as so often in the Old Testament) as types of persons in distress; the \"personae miserabiles\" of the Canon Law (see e.g. Deuteronomy 10:18; Psalm 68:5; Psalm 82:3; Isaiah 1:17; and cf. Ecclus. 4:10). \"Be as a father unto the fatherless, and instead of an husband unto their mother; so shalt thou be as the son of the Most High, and he shall love thee more than thy mother doth.\" To keep himself unspotted. Man's duty towards himself. (For ἄσπιλον, cf. 1 Timothy 6:14; 1 Peter 1:19; 2 Peter 3:14.) From the world. This clause may be connected either with τηρεῖν or with ἄσπιλον, as in the phrase, καθαρὸς ἀπὸ in Acts 20:26.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jas.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-13. - WARNING AGAINST RESPECT OF PERSONS.

According to the former view, which is on the whole preferable, it is parallel to James 3:1. The faith of our Lord. \"The faith\" here may be eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) objective (tides quae creditur), as in the Epistle of St. Jude 1:3, 20; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) subjective (tides qua creditur), \"Have the faith which believes in,\" etc. (cf. Mark 11:22). Our Lord Jesus Christ. Exactly the same title occurs in Acts 15:26, in the letter written from the Apostolic Council to the Syrian Churches - a letter which was probably drawn up by St. James himself. The Lord of glory. The same title is given to our Lord in 1 Corinthians 2:8, and seems to be founded on Psalm 24:7, etc. The genitive, τῆς δόξης, must depend on Κυρίου in spite of the intervening Ἰησοῦ Ξριστοῦ. Similar trajections occur elsewhere; e.g. Hebrews 12:11, where δικαιοσύνης depend, on καρπόν, and, according to a possible view, Luke 2:14 (see Hort's 'Greek Testament,' vol. 2, appendix, p. 56). Bengel's view, that τῆς δόξης is in apposition with Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Ξριστοῦ can scarcely be maintained, in the absence of any parallel expression elsewhere. Respect of persons (ἐν προσωποληψίαις) literally, reception of faces. The substantive is found here and three times in St. Paul's Epistles - Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 3:25; the verb (προσωποληπτεῖν) only here in ver. 9; προσωπολήπτης in Acts 10:31. None of them occur in the LXX., where, however, we find πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν in Leviticus 19:15; Malachi 2:9, etc. (cf. Luke 20:21), for the Hebrew גַשָׂז פָנִים. Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out ('Galatians,' p. 108) that, in the Old Testament, the expression is a neutral one, not necessarily involving any idea of partiality, and more often used in a good than in a bad sense. \"When it becomes an independent Greek phrase, however, the bad sense attaches to it, owing to the secondary meaning of πρόσωπον as a mask,' so that πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν signifies 'to regard the external circumstances of a man' - his rank, wealth, etc. - as opposed to his real intrinsic character. Thus in the New Testament it has always a bad sense.\" It is exactly this regard to external circumstances against which St. James is warning his readers; and the fact that our Lord Jesus Christ had himself been known, when on earth, as no respecter of persons (Luke 20:21), would give point to his warning. The plural (ἐν προσωποληψίαις) is perhaps used to include the different kinds of manifestations of the sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-4. - Proof that they were guilty of respect of persons. Observe the insight which this passage gives us into the cha-racier of the assemblies of the early Christians, showingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the entrance of a rich man was not entirely unknown, butNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that it was probably exceptional, because so much was made of him. NoticeNEWLINENEWLINE(3) συναγωγή used here, and here only in the New Testament, of a Christian assembly for worship (cf. Ignatius, 'Ad Polye.,' c. 4, Πυκνότερον συναγωγαὶ γινέσθωσαν). (On the distinction between συναγωγὴ and ἔκκλησία, and the history of the terms and their use, see an interesting section in Trench's ' Synonyms,' p. 1.) Verse 2. - A man with a gold ring (ἀνὴρ χρυσοδακτύλιος). The word is found here only. The English Versions (both A.V. and R.V.) needlessly limit its meaning. The man was probably bedecked with a number of rings, and had not one only. In goodly apparel. The same phrase is rendering \"gay clothing\" in ver. 3. The variation is quite unnecessary, the Greek being identical in both places, and rightly rendered by R.V. \"fine clothing.\" It is curious to find a similar needless variation in the Vulgate, which has in veste candida in ver. 2, and veste proeclara in ver. 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The copula (καὶ) of the Received Text is certainly spurious. It is found in K, L, but is wanting in א, A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic. B also omits the negative οὐ (so Westcott and Herr margin). If this manuscript is followed, the sentence must be read as a direct statement, and not as interrogative. But if (with most manuscripts and editions) the interrogative be retained, the translation is still doubtful. Διεκρίθητε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς may mean:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"Are ye not divided in your own mind?\" so the Syriac and R.V., which would imply that this respect of persons showed that they were halting between God and the world - in fact, double-minded.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"Do ye not make distinctions among yourselves?\" R.V. margin; this gives an excellent sense, but is wanting in authority, as there appears to be no other instance forthcoming of the passive with this meaning.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"Did you not doubt among yourselves?\" this (doubt) is the almost invariable meaning of διακρίναομαι in the New Testament, and the word has already been used in this sense by St. James (James 1:6). Hence this rendering is to be preferred. So Huther, Plumptre, and Farrar, the latter of whom explains the passage as follows: \"It shows doubt to act as though Christ had never promised his kingdom to the poor, rich in faith; and wicked reasonings to argue mentally that the poor must be less worthy of honor than the rich.\" Judges of evil thoughts (κριταὶ διαλογισμῶν πονηρῶν); sc. their own (thoughts), which caused them to respect persons. Thus the phrase is equivalent to \"evil-thinking judges.\" (On the genitive, see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T. Greek,' p. 233; and cf. James 1:25, ἀκροάτης ἐπιλησμονής.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-9. - Proof of the sinfulness of respect of persons. Verse 5. - Hearken (ἀκούσατε). This has been noticed as a coincidence with the speech of St. James in Acts 15:13. It is, however, too slight to be worth much (cf. Acts 7:2; Acts 13:16; Acts 22:1). For τοῦ κόσμου τούτου, read τῷ κόσμῳ (א, A, B, C), \"poor as to the world;\" perhaps \"in the estimation of the world.\" These God chose (to be) rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, etc. The kingdom; mentioned here only by St. James (and even here, א, A read ἐπαγγελίας); cf. νόμον βασιλικόν in ver. 8. Which he hath promised. As Dean Plumptre has pointed out, \"it is scarcely possible to exclude a direct reference to the words of Christ, as in Luke 6:20; Luke 12:31, 32; and so we get indirect proof of a current knowledge, at the early period at which St. James wrote, of teaching which was afterwards recorded in the written Gospels.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye have despised the poor.

Poor... rich. In the Old Testament we occasionally find the term \"poor\" parallel to \"righteous\" (Amos 2:6; Amos 5:12); and \"rich\" to \"wicked\" (Isaiah 53:9). St. James's use here is somewhat similar (see on James 1:9, etc.). \"Christiani multi ex pauperibus erant: pauci ex divitibus\" (Bengel). The \"rich men\" here alluded to are evidently such as was the Apostle Paul before his conversion.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) They dragged the poor Christians before the judgment-seat (ἕλκουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς κριτήρια). So Saul, \"haling (σύρων) men and women, committed them to prison\" (Acts 8:3).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) They blasphemed the honorable Name by which Christians were called. So Saul thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the Name of Jesus of Nazareth, and strove to make them blaspheme (Acts 26:9-11).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) All this they did in person (αὐτοί); \"themselves,\" just as Saul did. No difficulty need be felt about the presence of these rich men in the synagogues of the Christians (see Introduction, p. 8.). It will be noticed that St. James never calls them \"brethren.\" Further, it must be remembered that, at this early date, the Church had not yet learnt by bitter experience the need for that secrecy with which in later days she shrouded her worship. At this time the Christian assemblies were open to any who chose to find their way in. All were welcome, as we see from 1 Corinthians 14:23, etc., where the chance entry of \"men unlearned or unbelieving\" is contemplated as likely to happen. Hence there is no sort of difficulty in the presence of the \"rich man\" here, who might be eagerly welcomed, and repay his welcome by dragging them to the judgment-seat. Draw you before the judgment-seats. The account given by Josephus of the death of St, James himself affords a good illustration of the manner in which Christians were liable to this (see Introduction, p. 6.). But the tribunals need not be confined to Jewish ones. Other instances of similar treatment, illustrating the thoughts and language of the passage before us, may be found in Acts 16:19; Acts 17:6; Acts 18:12. Litigation of an entirely different character between Christians themselves is alluded to and condemned by St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - That worthy Name (τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα); the honorable Name; probably the Name of Christ, by which the disciples were known (Acts 11:26), and for which they suffered (Acts 5:41; 1 Peter 5:14-16). By the which ye are called; literally, which was called upon you (τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφ ὑμᾶς). A similar expression is found in St. James's speech in Acts 15:17, in a quotation from Amos 9:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8 - What is the connection with the foregoing? Μέντοι is ignored altogether by the A.V. Translate, with R.V., howbeit if ye fulfill, etc.; Vulgate, tamen. According to Huther, St. James here meets the attempt which his readers might, perhaps, make to justify their conduct towards the rich with the law of love; whilst he grants to them that the fulfillment of that law is something excellent, he designates προσωποληπτεῖν directly as a transgression of the law. Alford thinks that the apostle is simply guarding his own argument from misconstruction - a view which is simpler and perhaps more natural. The royal law. Why is the law of love thus styled? (The Syriac has simply \"the law of God.\")NEWLINENEWLINE(1) As being the most excellent of all laws; as we might call it the sovereign principle of our conduct (cf. Plato 'Min.,' p. 317, c, Τὸ ὀρθὸν νόμος ἐστὶ βασιλικός). Such an expression is natural enough in a Greek writer; but it is strange in a Jew like St. James (in the LXX. βασιλικός is always used in its literal meaning); and as the \"kingdom\" has been spoken of just before (ver. 5), it is betterNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to take the expression as literal here - \"the law of the kingdom\" (cf. Plumptre, in loc.). Thou shalt love, etc. (Leviticus 19:18). The law had received the sanction of the King himself (Matthew 22:39; Luke 10:26-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And are convinced, etc.; better, with R.V., being convicted by the law (ἐλεγχόμενοι ὑπὸ τοῦ νόμου). The Law of Moses directly forbade all respect of persons; see Leviticus 19:15 (three verses above the passage just quoted by St. James), Οὐ λήψῃ πρόσωπον πτωχοῦ οὐδὲ μὴ θαυμάσῃς πρόσωπον δυνάστον.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - In this verse the subjunctives τηρήσῃ πταίσῃ, are rightly read by the Revisors, with א, B, C. The Law was express on the need of keeping all the commandments; see Leviticus 19:37 (the same chapter to which St. James has already referred), Καὶ φυλάξωσθε πάντα τὸν νόμον μου καὶ πάντα τὰ προστάγματά μου καὶ ποιήσετε αὐτά). He is guilty of all. The very same thought is found in rabbinical writers (Talmud, 'Schabbath,' fol. 70); a saying of R. Johanan: \"Quodsi racist omnia unum vero omitter omnium est singulorum reus.\" Other passages to the same effect may be seen in Schottgen, 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 1. p. 1017, etc.; and cf., 'Pirqe Aboth,' 4:15. Was it a false inference from St. James's teaching in this verso that led the Judaizers of Acts 15. to lay down the law \"Except ye be circumcised after the customs of Moses ye cannot be saved\"? \"Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,\" might seem to suggest such an inference: \"To whom,\" says St. James himself, \"we gave no commandment\" (Acts 15:24).

The order of the commandments is remarkable; what is now the seventh is placed bolero the sixth. This appears to have been the usual order at that time. In this order our Lord quotes them in Luke 18:20, and St. Paul in Romans 13:9. Philo also has the same order, and expressly comments on it, drawing from it an argument for the heinousness of adultery ('Dec.,' 12:24). In the Vatican Manuscript of the LXX. in Exodus 20:13-15 the order is, \"Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not kill.\" But the Alexandrian Manuscript has the usual order, which is also found in Matthew 19:18 and Mark 10:19 (according to the correct reading).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - Conclusion of the subject: νόμος ἐλευθερίας (cf.

Preliminary note: This is the famous passage which led to Luther's depreciation of the whole Epistle, which he termed a \"right strawy\" one. At first sight it appears, indeed, diametrically opposed to the teaching of St. Paul; for:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) St. Paul says (Romans 3:28),\" We conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from (χωρίς) works of Law,\" whereas St. James asserts (ver. 26) that \"faith without (χωρίς) works is dead,\" and that man is \"justified by works and not by faith only\" (ver. 24).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) St. Paul speaks of Abraham as justified by faith (Romans 4; cf. Galatians 3:6, etc.); St. James says that he was justified by works (ver. 21).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) St. Paul, or the Pauline author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, appeals to the case of Rahab as an instance of faith (Hebrews 11:31); St. James refers to her as an example of justification by works (ver. 25). The opposition, however, is only apparent; for:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The two apostles use the word ἔργα different senses. In St. Paul it always has a depreciatory sense, unless qualified by the adjective καλὰ or ἄγαθα. The works which he denies to have any share in justification are \"legal works,\" not those which he elsewhere denominates the \"fruit of the Spirit\" (Galatians 5:22), which are the \"works\" of which St. James speaks.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The word πίστις is also used in different senses. In St. Paul it is πίστις δἰ ἀγαπῆς ἐνεργουμένη (Galatians 5:6); in St. James it is simply an orthodox creed, \"Even the devils πιστεύουσι (ver. 19): it may, therefore, be barren of works of charity.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The apostles are writing against different errors and tendencies: St. Paul against that of those who would impose the Jewish Law and the rite of circumcision upon Gentile believers; St. James against \"the self-complacent orthodoxy of the Pharisaic Christian, who, satisfied with the possession of a pure monotheism and vaunting his descent from Abraham, needed to be reminded not to neglect the still weightier matters of a self-denying love\" (Lightfoot on 'Galatians,' p. 370). [The tendency of the Jews to rely on their claim as \"Abraham's children\" is rebuked by the Baptist (Matthew 3:9) and by our Lord (John 8:39). So Justin Martyr speaks of the Jews of his day: Οἱ λέγουσιν ὅτι κα}ν ἁμαρτωλοὶ ῶσι θεὸν δέ γινώσκωσιν οὐ μὴ λογίσηται αὐτοῖς ἁμαρτίαν ('Dial.,' § 141).]NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The apostles regarded the new dispensation from different standpoints. With St. Paul' it is the negation of law: \"Ye are not under Law, but under grace\" (Romans 6:14). With St. James it is the perfection of Law. But, as Bishop Lightfoot has pointed out, \"the ideas underlying these contradictory forms of expression need not be essentially different.\" The mere ritual has no value for St. James. Apart from anything higher it is sternly denounced by him (James 1:20, etc.). The gospel is in his view a Law, but it is no mere system of rules, \"Touch not, taste not, handle not;\" it is no hard bondage, for it is a law of liberty, which is in exact accordance with the teaching of St. Paul, that \"where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\" (2 Corinthians 3:17). But:NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The question now arises. Granting that St. James does not contradict the doctrine of St. Paul, is he not opposing Antinomian perversions of it, and writing with conscious reference to the teaching of the apostle of the Gentiles, and the misuse which some had made of it? To this question different answers have been returned. \"So long as our range of view is confined to the apostolic writings, it seems scarcely possible to resist the impression that St. James is attacking the teaching, if not of St. Paul himself, at least of those who exaggerated and perverted it. But when we realize the fact that the passage in Genesis was a common thesis in the schools of the day, that the meaning of faith was variously explained by the disputants, that diverse lessons were drawn from it - then the case is altered. The Gentile apostle and the Pharisaic rabbi might both maintain the supremacy of faith as the means of salvation; but faith with St. Paul was a very different thing kern faith with Maimonides, for instance. With the one its prominent idea is a spiritual life, with the other an orthodox creed; with the one the guiding principle is the individual conscience, with the other an external rule of ordinances; with the one faith is allied to liberty, with the other to bondage. Thus it becomes a question whether St. James's protest against reliance on faith alone has any reference direct or indirect to St. Paul's language and teaching. Whether, in fact, it is not aimed against an entirely different type of religious feeling, against the Pharisaic spirit which rested satisfied with a barren orthodoxy fruitless in works of charity\" (Lightfoot on 'Galatians,' p. 164; the whole essay should be carefully studied). In favor of this view of the entire independence of the two writers, to which he inclines, Bishop Lightfoot urges:NEWLINENEWLINE(a) That the object of the much-vaunted faith of those against whom St. James writes is \"the fundamental maxim of the Law,\" \"Thou believest that God is one\" (Deuteronomy 6:4); not \"the fundamental fact of the gospel,\" \"Thou believest that God raised Christ from the dead\" (Romans 10:9).NEWLINENEWLINE(b) That the whole tone of the Epistle recalls our Lord's denunciations of the scribes and Pharisees, and seems directed against a kindred spirit. To these we may add:NEWLINENEWLINE(c) That the teaching of St. Paul and St. James is combined by St. Clement of Rome ('Ep. ad Corinthians,' c. 12.) in a manner which is conclusive as to the fact that he was unaware of any divergence of view between them, whether real or apparent. We conclude, then, that the teaching of St. James has no direct relation to that of St. Paul, and may well have been anterior in time to his Epistles to the Romans and Galatians. (For the opposite view, see Farrar's 'Early Days of Christianity,' vol. 2. p. 79, where an able discussion of the subject may be found.)

Luke 7:50; Luke 8:48).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Being alone (καθ ἑαυτήν); R.V., in itself. But the rendering of the A.V. appears to be justified by the LXX. in Genesis 43:31, Παρέθηκαν αὐτῷ μόνῳ καὶ αὐτοῖς καθ ἑαυτούς κ.τ.λ..NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. -NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Second point: Even the devils believe (πιστεύουσι). How worthless, then, must be faith (πίστις) alone! Verse 18. - Yea, a man may say (ἀλλ ἐρεῖτις). The objection in 1 Corinthians 15:35 is introduced by precisely the same words. It is somewhat difficult to see their drift here, as what follows cannot be an objection, for it is just the position which St. James himself adopts. The formula must, therefore, be taken as introducing the perfectly fair retort to which the man who gives utterance to the sentiments of ver. 16 lays himself open. Without thy works. Instead of χώρις (א, A, B, C, Latt., Syriac, Coptic), the Received Text has the manifestly erroneous reading ἐκ (K, L), in which it is happily not followed by the A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"Thou believest that God is one,\" R.V., reading Ὅτι εῖς ὁ Θεός ἐστιν: orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"Thou believest that there is one God,\" A.V. and R.V. margin, reading Ὅτι εῖς Θεὸς ἐστὶν. The reading, and by consequence the translation, must be considered somewhat doubtful, as scarcely any two uncials read the words in precisely the same order. The illustration is taken from the central command of the Old Testament (Deuteronomy 6:4), indicating that the case of Jews is under consideration. The following quotations from the Talmud will show the importance attached by the Jews to this command (Farrar, 'Early Days,' etc., p. 83). It is said ('Berachoth,' fol. 13, 6) that whoever in repeating it \"prolongs the utterance of the word 'One,' shall have his days and years prolonged to him.\" Again we are told that when Rabbi Akibah was martyred he died uttering this word \"One;\" and then came a Bath Kol, which said, \"Blessed art thou, Rabbi Akibah, for thy soul and the word 'One' left thy body together.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-24. -NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Third point: Proof from the example of Abraham that a man is justified by works and not by faith only. In Genesis 15:6 we read of Abraham that \"he believed in the Lord; and he accounted it to him for righteousness\" (LXX., Ἐπίστευσεν Αβραμ τῷ Θεῷ καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην, quoted by St. Paul in Romans 4:3; Galatians 3:6). But years after this we find that God \"tested Abraham\" (Genesis 22:1). To this trial St. James refers as that by which Abraham's faith was \"perfected\" (ἐτελειώθη), and by which the saying of earlier years found a more complete realization (cf. Ecclus. 44:20, 21, \"Abraham... kept the Law of the Most High, and was in covenant with him... and when he was proved, he was found faithful. Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed,\" etc.). Verse 20. - Faith without works is dead. The Received Text, followed by the A.V., reads νεκρά, with א, A, C3, K, L, Syriac, Vulgate (Clementine). The Revisers, following B, C1, if, read ἀργή, \"barren\" (so Vulgate Amiat. by a correction, otiosa).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWas not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And he was called the Friend of God. The expression comes from Isaiah 41:8; 2 Chronicles 20:7 (in the Hebrew, א; LXX., ὅν ἠγάπησα τῷ ἠγαπημένῳ σου). The same title, φίλος Θεοῦ, is given to Abraham by Clement of Rome ('Ad Corinthians,' 10; 17.), and was evidently a standing one among the Jews. Philo actually in one instance quotas Genesis 18:17 as Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ φίλου μου instead of ποῦ παιδός μου. Illustrations from later rabbinical writers may be found in Wetstein, and cf. Bishop Lightfoot on 'Clement of Rome,' p. 61. To this day it is said that Abraham is known among the Arabs as El Khalil, equivalent to \"the Friend.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. -NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Fourth point: Proof from the case of Rahab the harlot of justification by works (cf. Joshua 2; Joshua 6:25). Rahab is mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament in Hebrews 11:31, where she also appears as Ῥαὰβ ἡ πόρνη, and is spoken of as having \"received the spies,\" δεξαμένη τοὺς κατασκόπους cf. ὑποδεξαμένη τοὺς ἀγγέλους here. There, however, she is regarded as an instance of faith (see above in preliminary note). The only other place where her name occurs is in the genealogy of our Lord, in Matthew 1:5, \"Salmon begat Booz of Rachab (ἐκ τῆς Ραχάβ).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Conclusion of the whole matter: \"As the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Jas.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - WARNING AGAINST OVER-READINESS TO TEACH, LEADING TO A DISCOURSE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF GOVERNMENT OF THE TONGUE. Verse 1. -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Warning. Be not many teachers. The warning is parallel to that of our Lord in Matthew 23:8, seq., \"Be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher [διδάσκαλος, and not, as Textus Receptus, καθηγητής], and all ye are brethren.\" Comp. also 'Pirqe Aboth,' 1:11, \"Shemaiah said, Love work and hate lordship (הרבנות).\" The readiness of the Jews to take upon them the office of teachers and to set up as \"guides of the blind, teachers of babes,\" etc., is alluded to by St. Paul in Romans 2:17, seq., and such a passage as 1 Corinthians 14:26, seq., denotes not merely the presence of a similar tendency among Christians, but also the opportunity given for its exercise in the Church.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Reason for the warning. Knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment (ληψόμεθα). By the use of the first person, St. James includes himself, thus giving a remarkable proof of humility. (The Vulgate, missing this, has wrongly sumitis.) Comp. vers. 2, 9, where also he uses the first person, with great delicacy of feeling not separating himself from those whose conduct he denounces. Μεῖζον κρίμα. The form of expression recalls our Lord's saying of the Pharisees, \"These shall receive greater condemnation (περισσότερον κρίμα) \" (Mark 12:40; Luke 20:47).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Γὰρ gives the reason for this κρίμα. We shall be judged because in many things we all stumble, and it is implied that teachers are in danger of greater condemnation, because it is almost impossible to govern the tongue completely. With the thought comp. Ecclesiastes 7:20, \"There is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not.\" Πολλά is adverbial, as in Matthew 9:14, and may be eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"in many things,\" orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"oft.\" Ἅπαντες.

If any stumbleth not in word (R.V.). \"Control of speech is named, not as in itself constituting perfection, but as a crucial test indicating whether the man has or has not attained unto it\" (Plumptre). Τέλειος (see James 1:4). Ξαλιναγωγεῖν (cf. James 1:26). It is only found in these two passages; never in the LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Illustration of the last statement of ver. 2. The bit in the horse's mouth enables us to turn about the whole body. So the man who can govern his tongue has the mastery over the whole body. A remarkable parallel is afforded by Sophocles, 'Antigone,' 1. 470, Σμικρῷ χαλινῷ δ οῖδα τοὺς θυμουμένους ἵππους καταρτυθέιτας. So also Philo, 'De Op. Mundi,' p. 19, Τὸ θυμικώτατον ζῶον ἵππος ῤᾳδίως ἄγεται χαλινωθείς. The manuscript; authority is overwhelming in favor of εἰ δὲ (A, B, K, L; א, εἰδε γάρ, etc.; and Vulgate, si autem) instead of ἰδού of the Received Text (C has ἴδε, and the Syriac ecce): thus the apodosis is contained in the words, καὶ ὅλον κ.τ.λ. Translate, with R.V., now if we put the horses bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also. (For a similar correction of ἰδέ to εἰ δέ, see Romans 2:17.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Second illustration, showing the importance of the tongue and its government. The rudder is a very small thing, but it enables the steersman to guide the ship wherever he will, in spite of the storm. Whithersoever the governor listeth (ὅπου ἡ ὀρμὴ τοῦ εὐθυνοντος βούλεται, א, B); whither the impulse of the steersman willeth (R.V.); Vulgate, impetus dirigentis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Application, of illustration. The tongue is only a little member, but it boasts great things. The true reading appears to be μεγάλα αὐχεῖ (A, B, C). The compound verb of the Textus Receptus, μεγαλαυχεῖν, is found in the LXX. (Ezekiel 16:50; Zephaniah 3:11; 2 Macc. 15:32; Ecclus. 48:18).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Third illustration. A very small fire may kindle a very large forest. Ἡλίκον (א, A2, B, C1, Vulgate) should be read instead of ὀλίγον (A1, C2, K, L, ff). It is equivalent to quantulus as well as quantus. A somewhat similar thought to the one before us is found in Ecclus. 11:32, \"Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled.\" Υλη \"Matter,\" A.V.; \"wood,\" R.V. The word is only found here in the New Testament. In the LXX. it is used for a \"matter\" of judgment in Job 19:29; \"matter\" in the philosophical sense in Wisd. 11:18. (cf. 15:13); the \"matter\" of a book in 2 Macc. 2:24; the \"matter\" of a fire in Ecclus. 28:10 (the whole passage, vers. 8-12, is wroth comparing with the one before us); and for \"forest\" in Job 38:40; Isaiah 10:17. It is most natural to take it in this sense here (so Syriac and Vulgate, silva). \"The literal meaning is certainly to be preferred to the philosophical\" (Lightfoot on Revision, p. 140). Forest fires are frequently referred to by the ancients. Virgil's description of one ('Georgies,' 2:303) is well known; so also Homer's ('Iliad,' 11:155).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Application of illustration The translation is doubtful, οὕτως of the Received Text must certainly be deleted. It is wanting in א, A, B, C, K, Latt., Syriac. Three renderings are then possible.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the wheel of nature.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"And the tongue is a fire, that world of iniquity: the tongue is among our members that which defileth the whole body,\" etc.: so Vulgate.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) \"And the tongue is a fire: that world of iniquity, the tongue, is among our members that which defileth the whole body,\" etc. Of these, the first, which is that of the Revisers, appears to be preferable. A fourth rendering, which is wholly untenable, deserves notice for its antiquity, viz. that of the Syriac, \"The tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity (is the forest).\" The world of iniquity (ὁ κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας). The tongue is thus characterized, because it leads to and embraces all kinds of wickednesses. As Bishop Wordsworth points out, it contains within itself the elements of all mischief. A somewhat similar use of κόσμος is found in the LXX. of Proverbs 17:6, Τοῦ πιστοῦ ὅλος ὁ κόσμος τῶν χρημάτων τοῦ δὲ ἀπιστου οὐδὲ ὀβελός, \"The whole world of wealth is for the faithful: for the faithless not a penny.\" Καθίσταται: \"is set\" or \"has its place,\" and so simply \"is.\" The tongueNEWLINENEWLINE(1) defiles the whole body, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) sets on fire τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως, \"the wheel of birth\" or \"of nature\" - a very strange expression, and one almost without parallel. (Τροχός only here in the New Testament. There is, however, no doubt about its meaning \"wheel.\" The A.V., which took it as τρόχος, equivalent to \"course,\" is universally given up (see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T.,' p. 62). For γένεσις, comp. James 1:23. The Vulgate has retain nativitatis nostrae.) Alford translates the phrase, \"the orb of the creation,\" and in favor of this the use of the word τροχός in Psalm 77. (76.) 19 may be appealed to. But more natural is the interpretation of Dean Plumptre, who takes it as \"a figure for the whole of life from birth, the wheel which then begins to roll on its course and continues rolling until death.\" So Huther and Dean Scott in the ' Speaker's Commentary.' This view has the support of the Syriac Version: \"The course of our generations which run as a wheel;\" and is implied in the (false) reading of א, τῆς γενέσεως ἡμῶν, (compare the Vulgate). It should also be noticed that life is compared to a wheel in Ecclesiastes 12:6 (LXX., τροχός). And is set on fire. The tongue has already been called a fire. It is now shown how that fire is kindled - kern beneath, kern Gehenna. A similar expression is found in the Targum on Psalm 120:2, \"Lingua dolosa ... cum carbonibus juniperi, qui incensi sunt in Gehenna interne.\" Gehenna, here personified, is mentioned also in Matthew 5:22, 29, 30; Matthew 10:28; Matthew 18:9; Matthew 23:15, 33; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; Luke 12:5. Thus the passage before us is the only one in the New Testament where the word is used except, by our Lord himself. The word itself is simply a Graecised form of גֵּי הִנּום, \"valley of Hinnom,\" or fully, \"valley of the sons of Hinnom\" (variously rendered by the LXX. φάραγξ Ανννόμ or υἱοῦ Αννόμ or Γαιέννα, Joshua 18:16). This valley, from its associations, became a type of hell; and hence its name was taken by the Jews to denote the place of torment. In this sense it occurs in the New Testament, and frequently in Jewish writings (see Buxtorf, 'Lexicon,' sub verb. גְהִנָּם), and it is said that the later rabbis actually fixed upon this valley as the mouth of hell.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Fourth illustration, involving a proof of the terrible power of the tongue for evil. All kinds of wild animals, etc., can be tamed and have been tamed: the tongue cannot be. What a deadly power for evil must it therefore be! The famous chorus in Sophocles, 'Antigone,' 1. 332, seq., Πολλὰ τὰ δεινὰ κοὐδὲν ἀνθώπου δεινότερον πέλει, is quoted by nearly all commentators, and affords a remarkable parallel to this passage. Every kind of beasts, etc.; literally, every nature (φύσις) of beasts... hath been tamed by man's nature (τῇ φύσει τῇ ἀνθρωπίνῃ); Vulgate, omnis enim natura bestiarum... domita sunt a natura humana. (On the dative τῇ φύσει, see Winer, 'Gram. of N. T.,' p. 275.) With this fourfold enumeration of the brute creation (\"beasts ... birds.., serpents... things in the sea\"), cf. Genesis 9:2, \"The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon all the beasts (θήρια) of the earth, upon all the fowls (πέτεινα) of the heavens, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea.\" Serpents (ἐρπετά) would be better rendered, as B.V., creeping things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It is an unruly evil; rather restless, reading ἀκατάστατον (א, A, B) for ἀκατάσχετον of Textus Receptus (C, K, L); Vulgate, inquietum malum (cf. James 1:8). The nominatives in this verse should be noticed: \"The last words are to be regarded as a kind of exclamation, and are therefore appended in an independent construction\" (Winer, p. 668). A restless evil! Full of deadly poison! Compare the abrupt nominative in Philippians 3:19 with Bishop Light-feet's note. Deadly (θανατηφόρος); here only in the New Testament. In the LXX. it is found in Numbers 18:22; Job 33:23; 4 Macc. 8:17, 24; 15:23. For the figure, cf. Psalm 140:3, \"They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - Examples of the restless character of the tongue: \"With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it too we curse men who are made in his image.\" In the first clause we should read Κύριον (א, A, B, C, Coptic, Syriac, ff, and some manuscripts of the Vulgate) for Θεόν (Receptus, with K, L, and Vulgate). Made after the similitude of God; better, likeness (ὁμοίωσις). The words, which are taken from Genesis 1:26 (καὶ εῖπεν ὁ Θεὸς ποιήσωμεν ἄνθρωπον κατ εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν καὶ καθ ὁμοιώσιν) are added to show the greatness of the sin. Theologically they are important, as showing that the \"likeness of God\" in man (in whatever it may consist) was not entirely obliterated by the Fall. St. James's words would be meaningless if only Adam had been created in the image and likeness of God. So St. Paul speaks of fallen man as still \"the image (εἰκών) and glory of God\" (1 Corinthians 11:7; and cf. Genesis 9:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.

From one principle opposite things cannot be produced. Nothing can bring forth that which is not corresponding to its nature.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The same fountain cannot give both sweet and bitter water.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) A fig tree cannot yield olives, nor a vine figs.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Salt water cannot yield sweet.NEWLINENEWLINEHow, then, can the tongue yield both blessing and cursing? It will be seen that the thought in (2) is different from that in Matthew 7:16, to which it bears a superficial resemblance. There the thought is that a good tree cannot yield bad fruit. Here it is that a tree must yield that which corresponds to its nature; a fig tree must yield figs and not olives, etc. So can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. The Received Text, which the A.V. follows, is wrong here. Read, οὔτε ἀλυκόν γλυκὺ ποιῆσαι ὕδωρ (A, B, C, and א, except that it reads οὐδέ), and translate, neither can salt water yield sweet; Vulgate, sic neque salsa dulcem potest facere aquam; Syriac, \"Thus also salt waters cannot be made sweet.\" The construction, it will be seen, is suddenly changed in the middle of the verse, and St. James ends as if the previous clause had been οὔτε δύναται συκῆ ἐλαίας, κ.τ.λ. (cf. Winer, p. 619, Grimm's 'Lexicon of N. T. Greek,' p. 324).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCan the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-18. - WARNING AGAINST JEALOUSY AND FACTION. Ver. 13 contains the positive exhortation to meekness; ver. 14 the negative warning against jealousy and party spirit; and then the following verses place side by side the portraits of the earthly and the heavenly wisdom. Verse 13. - Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? (τίς σοφός καὶ ἐπιστήμων ἐν ὑμῖν;); better, who is wise and understanding among you? 'Απιστήμων is found here only in the New Testament. In the LXX. it is joined with σοφὸς (as here) in Deuteronomy 1:13; Deuteronomy 4:6. \"The ἐπιστήμων is one who understands and knows: the σοφὸς is one who carries out his knowledge into his life\" (Dr. Farrar, who aptly quotes Tennyson's line, \"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers\"). Out of a good conversation (ἐκ τῆς καλῆς ἀναστροφῆς); better, as R.V., by his good life. \"Conversation\" is unfortunate, because of its modern meaning. Meekness (πραύτης); cf. James 1:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Bitter envying, Ζῆλος in itself may be either good or bad, and therefore πικρόν is added to characterize it. Bishop Lightfoot (on Galatians 5:20) points out that \"as it is the tendency of Christian teaching to exalt the gentler qualities and to depress their opposites, ζῆλος falls in the scale of Christian ethics (see Clem. Romans, §§ 4-6), while ταπεινότης, for instance, rises.\" It may, perhaps, be an incidental mark of early date that St. James finds it necessary to characterize ζῆλος as πικρόν. Where St. Paul joins it with ἐριθείαι and ἔρις there is no qualifying adjective (Romans 13:13; 1 Corinthians 3:3; 2 Corinthians 12:20; Galatians 5:20). (On the distinction between ζῆλος and φθόνος, both of which are used by St. James, see Archbishop Trench on 'Synonyms,' § 26.). Strife (ἐριθείαν); better, party spirit, or faction (cf. Romans 2:8; 2 Corinthians 12:20; Galatians 5:20; Philippians 1:17; Philippians 2:3). The A.V. \"strife\" comes from a wrong derivation, as if ἐριθεία were connected with ἔρις, whereas it really comes from ἔριθος, a hired laborer, and so signifiesNEWLINENEWLINE(1) working for hire;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the canvassing of hired partisans; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) factiousness in general (see Lightfoot on Galatians 5:20). Glory not; i.e. glory not of your wisdom, a boast to which your whole conduct thus gives the lie.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - Contrast between the earthly and the heavenly wisdom:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the earthly (vers. 15, 16);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the heavenly (vers. 17, 18). Verse 15. - \" This wisdom [of which you boast] is not a wisdom which cometh down from above.\" Vulgate, non est enim ista sctpientia desursum descendens. But is earthly, sensual, devilish. Dr. Farrar well says that this wisdom is \"earthly because it avariciously cares for the goods of earth (Philippians 3:19); animal, because it is under the sway of animal lusts (1 Corinthians 2:14); demon-like, because full of pride, egotism, malignity, and ambition, which are the works of the devil (1 Timothy 4:1).\" Sensual (ψυχική), Vulgate, animalis; R.V. margin, natural or animal. The position of the word is remarkable, occurring between ἐπίγειος and δαιμονιώδης. it is never found in the LXX., nor (apparently) in the apostolic Fathers. In the New Testament it occurs six times - three times of the \"natural\" body, which is contrasted with the σῶμα πνευματικόν (1 Corinthians 15:44 (twice), 46); and three times with a moral emphasis resting upon it, \"and in every instance a most depreciatory\" (see 1 Corinthians 2:14), \"The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,\" and Jude 1:19, Ψυχικοὶ, πνεῦμα μὴ ἔχοντες. The ψυχή in general in the New Testament is that which is common to man with the brute creation, including the passions, appetites, etc.; and therefore, by the use of this word ψυχικός to describe the wisdom which cometh not from above, but is \"earthly, sensual [or, 'animal'], devilish,\" we are reminded of the contrast between the spirit of man which goeth upward and the spirit of a beast which goeth downward (Ecclesiastes 3:21). The \"animal\" man, then, is one who is ruled entirely by the ψυχή in the lower sense of the word; and by the depreciatory sense given to the adjective we are strongly reminded that \"nature\" is nothing without the aid of grace.

First pure, then peaceable. \"The sequence is that of thought, not of time\" (Plumptre). Purity must be secured, even at the expense of peace. Gentle, and easy to be entreated (ἐπιεκὴς εὐπειθής). The former of these two terms signifies \"forbearing under provocation\" (cf. 1 Timothy 3:3; Titus 3:2; 1 Peter 2:18); the latter is found only here. Vulgate, snadibilis; Syriac, \"obedient;\" R.V. as A.V., \"easy to be entreated,\" i.e. ready to forgive. Thus the conjunction of the two terms ἐπιεικής and εὐπειθής reminds us of the Jewish saying in 'Pirqe Aboth,' 5:17, describing four characters in dispositions, in which the man who is \"hard to provoke and easily pacified\" is set down as pious. Without partiality (ἀδιάκριτος); here only in the New Testament. The word is used in the LXX. in Proverbs 25:1; and by Ignatius (Ephesians 3; Magn. 15; Trall. 1), but none of these passages throw light on its meaning. It may be eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) without variance, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) without doubtfulness, orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) without partiality;NEWLINENEWLINEprobably (1) as R.V. text.

A terribly sadden transition from the \"peace\" with which James 3. closed. Verse 1. - Whence wars and whence fightings among you? The second \"whence\" (πόθεν) is omitted in the Received Text, after K, L, Syriac, and Vulgate; but it is supported by א, A, B, C, the Coptic, and Old Latin. Wars... fightings (πόλεμοι...μάχαι). To what is the reference? Μάχαι occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in 2 Corinthians 7:5, \"Without were fightings, within were fears;\" and 2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9, in both of which passages it refers to disputes and questions. It is easy, therefore, to give it the same meaning here. Πόλμοι, elsewhere in the New Testament, as in the LXX., is always used of actual warfare. In behalf of its secondary meaning, \"contention,\" Grimm ('Lexicon of New Testament Greek') appeals to Sophocles, 'Electra,' 1. 219, and Plato, 'Phaed.,' p. 66, c. But it is better justified by Clement of Rome, § 46, Ινα τί ἔρεις καὶ θυμοὶ καὶ διχοστσασίαι καὶ σχίσματα πόλεμος τε ἐν ὑῖν - a passage which has almost the nature of a commentary upon St. James's language. There is then no need to seek an explanation of the passage in the outbreaks and insurrections which were so painfully common among the Jews. Lusts (ἡδονῶν); R.V., \"pleasures.\" \"An unusual sense of ἡδοναί, hardly distinguishable from ἐπιθυμίαι, in fact taken up by ἐπιθυμεῖτε (Alford). With the expression, \"that war in your members,\" comp. 1 Peter 2:11, \"Abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul.\" Ver. 2 gives us an insight into the terrible difficulties with which the apostles had to contend. Those to whom St. James was writing were guilty of lust, which actually led to murder. So the charge in 1 Peter 4:15 evidently presupposes the possibility of a professing Christian suffering as a murderer or thief. Ye kill. The marginal rendering \"envy\" supplies a remarkable instance of a false reading once widely adopted, although resting simply on conjecture. There is no variation in the manuscripts or ancient versions. All alike have φονεύετε. But, owing to the startling character of the expression in an address to Christians, Erasmus suggested that perhaps φθονεῖτε, \"ye envy,\" was the original reading, and actually inserted it in the second edition of his Greek Testament (1519). In his third edition (1522) he wisely returned to the true reading, although, strangely enough, he retained the false one, \"invidetis,\" in his Latin version, whence it passed into that of Beza and others. The Greek φθονεῖτε appears, however, in a few later editions, e.g. three editions published at Basle, 1524 (Bebelius), 1546 (Herwagius), and 1553 (Beyling), in that of Henry Stephens, 1576; and even so late as 1705 is found in an edition of Oritius. In England the reading obtained a wide currency, being actually adopted in all the versions in general use previous to that of 1611, viz. those of Tyndale, Coverdale, Taverner, the Bishops Bible, and the Geneva Version. The Authorized Version relegated it to the margin, from which it has been happily excluded by the Revisers, and thus, it is to be hoped, it has finally disappeared. Ye kill, and desire to have. The combination is certainly strange. Dean Scott sees in the terms a possible allusion to \"the well-known politico-religious party of the zealots,\" and suggests the rendering, \"ye play the murderers and zealots.\" It is, perhaps, more probable that ζηλοῦτε simply refers to covetousness; cf. the use of the word (although with a better meaning) in 1 Corinthians 12:31; 1 Corinthians 14:1, 39.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - An evident allusion to the sermon on the mount, Matthew 7:7, \"Ask, and it shall be given to you... for every one that asketh receiveth.\" And yet St. James says, \"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss;\" for our Lord elsewhere limits his teaching, \"All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing,\" etc. (Matthew 21:22). Αἰτεῖτε... αἰτεῖσθε. The active and middle voices are similarly interchanged in 1 John 5:15, on which Dr. Westcott writes as follows: \"The distinction between the middle and the active is not so sharply drawn; but generally the personal reference is suggested by the middle, while the request is left wholly undefined as to its destination by the active.\" That ye may consume it upon your lusts; render, with R.V., that ye may spend it in your pleasures; ἡδοναί, as in ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Ye adulterers and adulteresses. Omit μοιχοὶ καί, with א, A, B. The Vulgate has simply adulteri; the Old Latin (ff), fornicatores. Similarly the Syriae. Very strange is this sudden exclamation, \"ye adulteresses!\" and very difficult to explain. The same word (μοιχαλίς) is used as a feminine adjective by our Lord in the expression, \"an evil and adulterous generation\" (Matthew 12:39; Matthew 16:4; Mark 8:38); and in this possibly lies the explanation of St. James's use of the term. More probably, however, it should be accounted for as a reminiscence of Ezekiel 23:45, where we read of Samaria and Jerusalem under the titles of Aholah and Aholibah: \"The righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.\" It is remarkable too that in Malachi 3:5 the LXX. has μοιχαλίδες, although the Hebrew has the masculine, and men are evidently referred to. If, then, in the Old Testament the Jewish communities were personified as adulteresses, it is not unnatural for St. James to transfer the epithet to those Judaeo-Christian communities to which he was writing; and the word should probably be taken, just as in the Old Testament, of spiritual fornication, i.e. apostasy from God, shown in this case, not by actual idolatry, but by that \"friendship of the world\" which is \"enmity with God,\" and by \"covetousness which is idolatry.\" Φιλία. The word occurs here only in the New Testament. With the thought of this verse, compare our Lord's words in John 15:18, 19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - The difficulty of the passage is well shown by the hesitation of the Revisers. The first clause is rendered, \"Or think ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain?\" but as an alternative there is suggested in the margin, \"Or think ye that the Scripture saith in vain?\" as if the following clause were a quotation from Scripture. And of this following clause three possible renderings are suggested.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) In the text: \"Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the Scripture saith,\" etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Margin 1: \"The Spirit which he made to dwell in us he yearneth for even unto jealous envy. But he giveth,\" etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Margin 2: \"That Spirit which he made to dwell in us yearneth for us even unto jealous envy. But he giveth,\" etc. Further, it is noted in the margin that some ancient authorities read \"dwelleth in us,\" i.e. κατώκησεν, which is the reading of the Received Text, and so of the A.V. resting upon K, L; א and B being the primary authorities for κατώκισεν. With regard to the first clause, the rendering of the R.V., \"speaketh,\" may be justified by Hebrews 9:5. It is possible that St. James was intending to quote Proverbs 3:34 immediately, but after the introductory formula, η} δοκεῖτε ὅτι κενῶς ἡ γραφὴ λέγει, he interposes with the emphatic question, \"Is it to envy,\" etc.? and does not arrive at the quotation till ver. 6, when he introduces it with a fresh formula of quotation, διὸ λέγει, a looseness of construction which is quite natural in a Hebrew. Other views, for which it is believed there is less to be urged, are the following:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the words, πρὸς φθονόν, κ.τ.λ., are a quotation from some (now lost) early Christian writing. On this view the passage is parallel to Ephesians 5:14, where a portion of a Christian hymn is introduced by the words, διὸ λέγει.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That St. James is referring to the general drift rather than to the exact words of several passages of the Old Testament; e.g. Genesis 6:3-5; Deuteronomy 32:10, 19, etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) That the allusion is to some passage of the New Testament, either Galatians 5:17 or 1 Peter 2:1, etc. Passing on to the translation of the second clause, πρὸς φθονόν κ.τ.λ., it must be noted that φθονός is never used elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. (Wisd. 6:25; 1 Macc. 8:16) or in the apostolic Fathers except in a bad sense. True that Exodus 20:5 teaches us that God is a \"jealous God,\" but there the LXX. renders קנא by the far nobler word ζηλωτής: cf. Wolf, 'Curae Philippians Crit.,' p. 64, where it is noted that, while ζῆλος is a vex media, the same cannot be said of φθονός, which is always vitiosa, and is never used by the LXX. ubi vox Hebraica ׃תסך סעדנךמךרפצך סעתאלךר סךנךמוה לךשׁ מעךדּ דא קנאה This seems to be a fatal objection to the marginal readings of the Revised Version, and to compel us to rest content with that adopted in the text, \"Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?\" or rather, \"Is it to envying that the Spirit... longs?\" πρὸς φθονόν being placed for emphasis at the beginning of the sentence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - God resisteth the proud. The connection of this with ver. 4 is very close, and is favorable to the view taken above as to the meaning of the first clause of ver. 5, as the words appear to be cited in support of the statement that whosoever would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. The quotation is from Proverbs 3:34, LXX., Κύριος ὑπερηφάνοις ἀντιτάσσεται, ταπεινοῖς δὲ δίδωσι χάριν. St. James's version agrees with this exactly, except that it has ὁ Θεὸς instead of Κύριος (the Hebrew has simply \"he,\" ran). The passage is also quoted in precisely the same form by St. Peter (1 Peter 5:5), and with Θεὸς instead of ὁ Θεός by St. Clement of Rome. In St. Peter the quotation is followed by the injunction, \"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God .... Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom withstand (ω΅ι ἀντίστητε) steadfast in the faith.\" There is clearly a connection between this passage and the one before us in St. James, which proceeds, \"Be subject therefore unto God; but resist the devil (ἀντίστητε δὲ τῷ διαβόλῳ), and he will flee from you.\" This passage, it will be felt, is the simpler, and therefore, probably, the earlier of the two (cf. James 1:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSubmit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - Exhortation based on the preceding, quite in the style of a prophet of the Old Testament.

Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Draw nigh to God (ἐγγίσατε τῷ Θεῷ). A phrase used of approach to God under the old covenant (see Exodus 19:22; Exodus 34:30; Leviticus 10:3). Equally necessary under the new covenant is it for those who draw near to God to have \"clean hands and a pure heart\" (Psalm 24:4). Hence the following injunction: \"Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - St. James's version of \"Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted\" (Matthew 5:4). Be afflicted. Ταλαιπωρήσατε: only here in the New Testament, occasionally in the LXX. Heaviness. Κατήφεια: another ἄπαξ λεγόμενον, apparently never found in the LXX. or in the apostolic Fathers; it is, however, used by Josephus and Philo. It is equivalent to \"dejection,\" and \"exactly describes the attitude of the publican, who would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, Luke 18:13 (Plumptre).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHumble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Humble yourselves, etc. A further parallel with our Lord's teaching, St. James's words being perhaps suggested by the saying recorded in Matthew 23:12, \"Whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted\" (ὑψωθήσεται, as here, \"He shall lift you up,\" ὑψώσει). In the sight of the Lord (ἐνώπιον). The article (τοῦ) in the Received Text is certainly wrong. It is wanting in a, A, B, K. The anarthrous Κύριος is used by St. James here and in James 5:4, 10 (with which contrast ver. 14), and 1 l, as equivalent to the \"Jehovah\" of the Old Testament, which is represented in the LXX. by Κύριος without the article.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak not evil one of another, brethren.

Verse 11. - Speak not evil. Καταλαλεῖν: only here and 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 3:16. Vulgate, detrahere. But the context shows that the writer is thinking rather of harsh censorious judging. R.V., \"Speak not one against another.\" And judgeth; rather, or judgeth; η} (א, A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic) for καὶ of the Textus Receptus. Speaketh evil of the law. What law? According to Dean Plumptre, \"the royal law of Christ, which forbids judging (Matthew 7:1-5).\" Alford: \"The law of Christian life: the old moral Law, glorified and amplified by Christ: the νόμος βασιλικός of James 2:8; νόμος τῆς ἐλευθερίας of James 1:25.\" Huther: \"the law of Christian life which, according to its contents, is none other than the law of love.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - To play the part of a censor is to assume the office of a judge. But this is an office which belongs to God and not to man (cf. Romans 14:3, 4). The first words of the verse should be rendered as follows: \"One only is the Lawgiver and Judge:\" the last words, καὶ κριτής, omitted in the Received Text, being found in א, A, B, and most versions, the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic. In the last clause also the Received Text requires correction.

Verse 13. - Go to; Ἄγε, properly, the imperative, but here used adverbially, a usage common in Greek prose, and found again in James 5:1. (For the word, comp. Judy. 19:6; 2 Kings 4:24; and for similar instances of the singular where more than one person is referred to, see Wetstein, col. 2. p. 676.) The Received Text (Stephens) requires some correction in this verse. Read, σήμερον η} αὔριον with א, B; the futures πορεύσομεθα ποιήσομεν ἐμπορευσόμεθα and κερδήσομεν (B, Latt., Syriac) instead of the subjunctives; and omit ἔνα after ἐνιαυτόν, with a, B, Latt., Coptic. Continue there a year; rather, spend a year there, ἐνιαυτὸν being the object of the verb and not the accusative of duration. For ποιεῖν, used of time, cf. Acts 15:33; Acts 18:23; Acts 20:3; 2 Corinthians 11:25. The Latins use facto in the same way; e.g. Cicero, 'Ad Attic.,' 5. 20, \"Apamea quinque dies morati... Iconii decem fecimus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life?

Proverbs 27:1, \"Boast not thyself of tomorrow (τὰ εἰς αὔριον), for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.\" Whereas ye know not; rather, seeing that, or, inasmuch as ye know not, etc. (οἵτινες οὐκ ἐπίστασθε). The text in this verse again in a somewhat disorganized condition, but the general drift is clear. We should probably read, Οἵτινες οὐκ ἐπίστασθε τὸ τῆς αὔριον ποίαἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν ἀτμὶς γὰρ ἐστε ἡ πρὸς ὀλίγον φαινομένη ἔπειτα καὶ ἀφανιζομένη, R.V., \"Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow.

This verse follows in thought on ver. 13, ver. 14 having been parenthetical. \"Go to now, ye that say... instead of your saying (as ye ought), If the Lord will,\" etc. Once more the text requires correction, as the futures ζήσομεν and ποιήσομεν should be read (with א, A, B), instead of the subjunctives of the Received Text. It is generally agreed now that the verse should be rendered,\" If the Lord will, we shall both live and do this or that.\" But it is possible to divide it differently, and to render as follows: \"If the Lord will, and we live, we shall also do this or that.\" Vulgate, si Dominus voluerit et si [omit si, Codex Amiat.] vixerimus, faciemus, etc. (cf. Winer, 'Grammar of N.T. Greek,' p. 357).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - But now. As is actually the case, \"ye glory in your vauntings.\" ἈλαζονείΑ: only here and in 1 John 2:16; in the LXX., in 2 Macc. 9:8 and Wisd. 5:8. It is a favorite word with St. Clement of Rome. On its meaning and distinction from ὑπερηφανία and other kindred words, see Trench on ' Synonyms,' p. 95; and cf. Westcott on the 'Epistles of St. John,' p. 64. The vice of the ἀλάζων \"centers in self and is consummated in his absolute self-exaltation, while the ὑπερήφανος shows his character by his overweening treatment of others. The ἀλάζων sins most against truth; the ὑπερήφανος sins most against love.\" This extract will serve to show the fitness of ἀλαζονεία rather than ὑπερηφανία in the passage before us. The verse should be rendered, as in R.V., \"But now ye glory (καυχᾶσθε) in your vauntings: all such glorying (καύχησις) is evil.\" Καύχησις is the act, not the matter (καύχημα), of glorying.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Conclusion of the section. \"Some have supposed a direct reference to Romans 14:23, 'Whatsover is not of faith is sin.'

The perfects (σέσηπε... γέγονεν) are probably to be explained as \"prophetic,\" in accordance with a common Hebrew idiom (see Driver on the 'Tenses of the Hebrew Verb,' § 14; and cf. Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament Greek,' p. 342: \"The perfect does not stand for a present or future, but the case indicated by the apostle in ταλαιπωρίαις ὑμῶν ταῖς εηπερχομέναις is viewed as already present, and consequently the σήπειν of the riches as already completed\"). For an instance of the prophetic perfect, used as here after ὀλούζείν, see Isaiah 23:1, 14,\" Howl.... for your stronghold has been wasted.\" The miseries coming upon the rich are thus announced to be the destruction of everything in virtue of which they were styled rich. Their costly garments, in a great store of which the wealth of an Eastern largely consists, should become moth-eaten. Their gold and silver should be rusted. Bengel notes on this passage: \"Scripta haec suut paucis annis ante obsidionem Hierosolymorum;\" and certainly the best commentary upon it is to be found in the terrible account given by Josephus of the sufferings and miseries which came upon the Jews during the war and siege of Jerusalem. The Jewish historian has become the unconscious witness to the fulfillment of the prophecies of our Lord and his apostle. Σέσηπεν: only here in the New Testament; in the LXX., Job 16:7.

Shall he a witness against you (εἰς μαρτύριον ὑμῖν). The rendering of the A.V. is quite defensible (see Winer, p. 265), but it is equally possible to take the words as the R.V. margin,\" for a testimony unto you.\" \"The rust of them,\" says Alford, \"is a token of what shall happen to yourselves; in the consuming of your wealth you see depicted your own.\" Two interpretations of the latter part of the verse are possible, depending on the punctuation adopted.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) As the A.V. and R.V., putting the stop after πῦρ: \"Their rust... shall eat your flesh as fire. Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.\" The \"fire,\" if this rendering be adopted, may be explained from Ezekiel 24:9, etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Putting the stop after ὑμῶν and before ὡς πῦρ: \"Their rust... shall eat your flesh. Ye have heaped up as it were fire in the last days.\" This has the support of the Syriac (\"Ye have gathered fire for you for the last days\"), and is adopted by Drs. Westcott and Herr. The \"fire\" will, of course, be the fire of judgment; and the expression, ὡς πῦρ ἐθησαυρίσατε, may easily have been suggested by Proverbs 16:27, Ἀνὴρ ἄφρων ὀρύσσει ἑαυτῷ κακά ἐπὶ δὲ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ χειλέων θησαυρίζει πῦρ. The whole form of expression also reminds us of St. Paul's \"treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath\" (Romans 2:5), to which it is exactly parallel, the \"wrath in the day of wrath\" there answering to the \"fire in the last days\" here. (The rendering of the Vulgate is evidently influenced by this parallel, as it has thesaurizastis tram.) For the last days; rather, in the last days (ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις); cf. 2 Timothy 3:1. If the words are connected with πῦρ as suggested above, there is no difficulty in them. If the punctuation of the A.V. be retained, we must suppose that the writer is speaking from the point of view of the last day of all. \"When the end came it found them heaping up treasures which they could never use\" (Dean Scott). But the other view, though not so generally adopted, seems fat' preferable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4 accounts for the miseries that are coming upon them. Their sins are the cause. The language is modeled upon the Old Testament, and the special sin denounced is one that is expressly forbidden in the Law (see Deuteronomy 24:14, 15, \"Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy. At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it: for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee;\" cf. Malachi 3:5, \"I will be a swift witness... against those that oppress the hireling in his wages (LXX., ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστεροῦντας μισθὸν μισθωτοῦ)\" Later allusions to the same sin are found in Tobit 4:14; Ecclus. 34:22. Which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth. For ἀπεστερημένος of the Received Text, read ἀφυστερημένος (א, B). It is possible to join the words ἀφ ὑμῶν with κράζει, but it is more natural to take them as the A.V. with ἀφυστερημένος. Reaped... reaped (ἀμησάντων... θερισάντων); R.V., \"mowed... reaped.\" But it would seem that the words should have been reversed, as, judging by Old Testament usage, ἀμάω is always used of corn (Leviticus 25:11; Deuteronomy 24:19; Isaiah 17:5; Isaiah 37:30; Micah 6:15); while θερίζειν is the wider word, including all \"harvesting,\" and used of χόρτος in Psalm 128. (127.) 7; Jeremiah 9:22. Into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. These words are adopted from Isaiah 5:9, Κύριος Σαβαώθ, a Grecized form of the Hebrew יהוה צבאות, frequent in the LXX. Found in the New Testament only here and Romans 9:29 (in a quotation); elsewhere, e.g. in the Apocalypse, it is represented by παντοκράτωρ (Revelation 1:8, etc.); so also in 2 Corinthians 6:18 (equivalent to 2 Samuel 7:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Further description of their sin. Ye have lived in pleasure (ἐτρυφήσατε, here only) on the earth, and been wanton (ἐσπαλατήσατε, only here and 1 Timothy 5:6); ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter. The ὡς of the Received Text (\"as in a day,\" etc., A.V.) is quite wrong; it is wanting in א, A, B, Latt., Memphitic. The clause seems to imply that they were like brute beasts, feeding securely on the very day of their slaughter. Vulgate (Clem.), in die occisionis; but Codex Amiat., in diem occisionis. The actual expression, ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σφαγῆς, may have been suggested by Jeremiah 12:3, \"Prepare them for the day of slaughter (LXX., εἰς ἡμέραν σφαγῆς αὐτῶν).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The climax of their sin. Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous one. Does this allude to the death of our Lord? At first sight it may well seem so. Compare St. Peter's words in Acts 3:14, \"Ye denied the Holy One and the Just (δίκαιον);\" St. Stephen's in Acts 7:52, \"the coming of the Just One (τοῦ δικαίου);\" and St. Paul's in Acts 22:14, \"to see the Just One (τὸν δίκαιον).\" But this view is dispelled when we remember how throughout this whole passage the ideas and expressions are borrowed from the Old Testament, and when we find that in Isaiah 3:10 (LXX.) the wicked are represented as saying, Δήσωμεν τὸν δίκαιον ὅτι δύσχρηστος ἡμῖν ἐστί ( α passage which lies at the root of the remarkable section in Wisd. 2, \"Let us oppress the poor righteous man .... Let us condemn him with a shameful death.\" It is probable, then, that passages such as these were in St. James's mind, and suggested the words, and thus that there is no direct allusion to the Crucifixion (which, indeed, could scarcely be laid to the charge of his readers), but that the singular τὸν δίκαιον is used to denote the class collectively (cf. Amos 2:6; Amos 5:12). It is a remarkable coincidence, pointed out by most commentators, that he who wrote these verses, himself styled ὁ Δίκαιος by the Jews, suffered death at their hands a very few years afterwards. He doth not resist you. According to the view commonly adopted, St. James simply means to say that the righteous man suffered this evil at their hands without resistance. Another interpretation seems more possible, taking the clause as interrogative, \"Does he not resist you?\" the subject, implied but not expressed, being God; as if he would say, \"Is not God against you? \" - that God of whom it has already been said that he resists (ἀντιτάσσεται) the proud (comp. Hosea 1:6, \"I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly take them away (LXX., ἀλλ η} ἀντιτασσόμενος ἀντιτάξομαι αὐτοῖς)\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.

Verses 7-11. - Exhortation to patience. Verse 7. - Be patient therefore. In his concluding remarks St. James reverts to the point from which he started (comp. James 1:3, 4). Μακροθυμεῖν is here given a wider meaning than that which generally attaches to it. As was pointed out in the notes on James 1:3, it ordinarily refers to patience in respect of persons. Here, however, it certainly includes endurance in respect of things, so that the husbandman is said μακροθυμεῖν where we should rather have expected ὑπομενεῖν (cf. Lightfoot on Colossians 1:11). Unto the coming of the Lord (ἕως τῆς παρουσίας τοῦ Κυρίου); Vulgate, usque ad adventure Domiai. The word παρουσία ηαδ been used by our Lord himself of his return to judge, in Matthew 24:3, 27, 37, 39. It is also found in St. Paul's writings, only, however (in this sense), in Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 2:19; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8) and 1 Corinthians 15:23. St. Peter uses it in his Second Epistle (2 Peter 1:16; 3:4, 12), as does St. John (1 John 2:28). Behold, the husbandman, etc. Consideration, exciting to patience, drawn from an example before the eyes of all. Until he receive; better, taking γή as the subject of the verb, until it receive. The early and the latter rain. Υετόν of the Received Text has the authority of A, K, L, and the Syriac Versions; א (with which agree the Coptic and Old Latin, if), καρπόν. B and the Vulgate omit the substantive altogether. In this they are followed by most critical editors (e.g. Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort), but not by the Revisers; and as the expression, πρώιμον καὶ ὄψιμον, without the substantive, is never found in the LXX., it is safer to follow A and the Syriac in retaining ὑετόν here. (For \"the early and the latter rain,\" comp. Deuteronomy 11:14; Jeremiah 5:24; Joel 2:23; Zechariah 10:1.) \"The first showers of autumn which revived the parched and thirsty soil and prepared it for the seed; and the later showers of spring which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the field\" (Robinson, quoted in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 2:994).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Application of illustration, repeating the exhortation of ver. 7, and supporting it by the assurance that \"the coming of the Lord,\" till which they are to endure, \"is at hand.\" Stablish your hearts (comp. 1 Thessalonians 3:13, \"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints\"). The coming of the Lord draweth nigh. So Isaiah had announced (Isaiah 13:6), \"The day of the Lord is near (ἐγγὺς ἡμέρα Κυρίου).\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGrudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Grudge not, brethren; better, with R.V., murmur not - a meaning which \"grudge\" had in the seventeenth century; cf. Psalm 59:15 (Prayer-book version), \"They will run here and there for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.\" What is the connection of this verse with the preceding? \"Murmuring\" implies sitting in judgment upon others, which has been expressly forbidden by the Lord himself. It is also the opposite to that μακροθυμία to which St. James has been exhorting his readers. Lest ye be condemned; rather, that ye be not judged. Ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε, as in Matthew 7:1. Κατακριθῆτε of the Received Text has absolutely no authority, nor has the omission of the article before κριτής in the following clause. Behold, the Judge, etc. The nearness of the judgment is expressed by saying that the Judge is actually standing \"before the doors (πρὸ τῶν θυρῶν).\" So also our Lord, in his great discourse on the judgment, says (Matthew 24:33), \"When ye see all these things, know that he is nigh, even at the doors (ἐγγύς ἐστιν ἐπὶ θύραις);\" and comp. Revelation 3:20, where he says, \"Behold, I stand at the door (ἕστηκα ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν), and knock.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The injunction is further strengthened by an appeal to the example of the prophets of the old covenant, an \"example of suffering and of patience.\" Read ἐν τῶ ὀνόματι, with א, B, and observe the anarthrous Κυρίου (cf. on James 4:10). Suffering affliction. Τῆς κακοπαθείας.: here only in the LXX., Malachi 1:13; 2 Macc. 2:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Behold, we count them happy. Μακαρίζειν: only here and Luke 1:48 (comp. James 1:12, \"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation;\" Daniel 12:12, \"Blessed is he that waiteth\"). Which endure; rather, which endured, reading ὑπομείναντας, with א, A, B, Syriac, Latt. (quisustinuerunt). Ye have heard of the patience of Job. A book very rarely referred to in the New Testament; only here and in 1 Corinthians 3:19, where Job 5:13 is quoted. And have seen the end of the Lord. Ἴδετε (\"see\") is found in A, B, L, but εἴδετε of the Received Text has the support of א, B, K, Vulgate (ridistis), and is now generally adopted. The \"end of the Lord (τὸ τέλος Κυρίου)\" cannot possibly be interpreted of the death and resurrection of our Savior. The whole context is against this, and Κυρίου would certainly require the article. The Syriac Version rightly interprets the clause, \"the end which the Lord wrought for him.\" It dearly refers to the end which God brought about in the case of Job, whose \"latter end the Lord blessed more than his beginning\" (Job 42:12; cf. Winer, 'Grammar of New Testament Greek,' p. 309). That the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy, Πολύσπλαχνος: here only; never in the LXX, but equivalent to Hebrew רַב חֶסֶד; cf. Psalm 103. (102.), 8; 111. (110.), 4, which may have suggested the phrase to St. James. Οἰκτίρμων: only here and Luke 6:36; several times in the LXX. Ὁ Κύριος is omitted entirely in K, L, and some manuscripts of the Vulgate; the article is also wanting in B.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Exhortation against swearing, founded on our Lord's teaching in the sermon on the mount, Matthew 5:33-37 - a passage which was evidently present to St. James's thoughts. He, like his Master, \"lays down rules and maxims and principles without specifying the limitations and exceptions.\" The sermon on the mount, as interpreted by our Lord's own actions, is a clear witness that this formed Ms method of teaching. If, then, his words do not touch the case of oaths solemnly tendered to men in a court of justice (and his own acceptance of an adjuration on his trial shows that they do not), no more do St. James's. Both our Lord and his apostle had probably in view \"only those profane adjurations with which men who have no deep-seated fear of God garnish their common talk\" (see Sadler's 'Commentary on St. Matthew,' p. 66). The special oaths mentioned were those in vogue among the Jews, and just the very ones which our Lord himself had specified (comp. Lightfoot's 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 2. p. 127, edit. Gandell). On the need of such teaching as this, see Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 190: \"This people are fearfully profane. Everybody curses and swears when in a passion. No people that I have ever known can compare with these Orientals for profaneness in the use of the names and attributes of God. The evil habit seems inveterate and universal. When Peter, therefore, 'began to curse and to swear' on that dismal night of temptation, we are not to suppose that it was something foreign to his former habits. He merely relapsed, under high excitement, into what, as a sailor and a fisherman, he had been accustomed to all his life. The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long.\" So, too, Aben Ezra speaks of the practice of swearing as almost universal in his day, so that he says, \"men swear daily countless times, and then swear that they have not sworn!\" With regard to the translation of the verse, two renderings are possible:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that of the A.V. and of the R.V. (text), \"Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That of the R.V. margin, \"Let yours be the yea, yea, and the nay, nay;\" viz. those enjoined by our Lord (Matthew 5:37), \"Let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\" On behalf of this latter rendering, may be pleadedNEWLINENEWLINE(a) the clearness of the reference to our Lord's teaching; andNEWLINENEWLINE(b) the fact that this is the interpretation given to the clause in the two leading versions of antiquity, the Syriac and the Vulgate, both of which have exactly the same words here and in St. Matthew. Vulgate, Sit autem sermo vester est est, non non. Lest ye fall into condemnation. Happily the A.V. here follows the text of the Elzevirs, ὑπὸ κρίσιν (א, A, B, Latt., Syriac, Coptic), and so avoids the erroneous reading of Stephens, εἰς ὑπόκρισιν (K, L).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs any among you afflicted? let him pray.

Praise, the highest form of prayer, is to spring up from the grateful heart of the cheerful. Ψάλλειν (cf. Romans 15:9; 1 Corinthians 14:15; Ephesians 5:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - Directions in ease of sickness. Let him call for the elders of the Church. Of the original creation of the presbyterate no account is given, but elders appear as already existing in Judaea in Acts 11:30; and from Acts 14:23 we find that St. Paul and St. Barnabas \"appointed elders in every Church\" which they had founded on their first missionary journey. Nothing, therefore, can be concluded with regard to the date of the Epistle from this notice of elders. The elders were to be summoned for a twofold purpose:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that they might pray over the sick person (on the accusative ἐπ αὐτόν, see Winer, p. 508); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that they might anoint him with oil in the Name of the Lord, The result anticipated is also twofold:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"the prayer of faith shall save the sick\" (\"save,\" σώζειν, here as in other passages, e.g. Matthew 9:21, 22, etc., refers to bodily healing); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.\" (From the manner in which this last clause is introduced, it may fairly be inferred that the sins in question are presumed to have had some connection with the sickness, and to have been its cause. Vulgate, Et si in peccatis sit dimittentur cf.) Anointing him with oil in the Name of the Lord. By the omission of the last words, τοῦ Κυρίου, B has the striking reading, \"anointing him with oil in THE NAME\" (compare the use of τὸ ὄνομα absolutely in Acts 5:41 3John 7). A similar use is also found in the Epistles of Ignatius. The Vatican Manuscript, however, appears to stand quite alone in this reading here. If the words, τοῦ Κυρίου, be admitted, they must be taken as referring to the Lord Jesus (contrast ver. 10, ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου). So also in ver. 15 the Lord (ὁ Κύριος) who shall raise him up is clearly the Lord Jesus. Had God the Father been alluded to we should probably have had the anarthrous Κύριος after the manner of the LXX. (see note on James 4:10). Unction is mentioned in connection with the sick also in Mark 6:13. The apostles \"anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them;\" and compare the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:34), \"pouring in wine and oil.\" \"Josephus mentions that among the remedies employed in the case of Herod, he was put into a sort of oil bath.... The medicinal use of oil is also mentioned in the Mishna, which thus exhibits the Jewish practice of that day\" ('Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. it. p. 595; see Mishna, 'Shabbath,' 13:4; and compare Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. it. p. 415). According to Tertullian, \"the Christian Proculus, surnamed Torpacion, the steward of Euhodus,\" cured with oil Severus, the father of Antonino (i.e. Caracalla), who \"in gratitude kept him in his palace till the day of his death.\" Tertullian, 'Ad Scapulam,' c. 4. (see Oehler's notes on the passage). But in the case before us if, as in these other instances, the oil was used as an actual remedy,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) why was it to be administered by the elders? andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) why is the healing immediately afterwards attributed to \"the prayer of faith\"? These questions would seem to suggest that oil was enjoined by St. James rather as an outward symbol than as an actual remedy. A further question remains to which a few lines must be devoted. Is the apostle prescribing a rite for all times? On the one hand, we are told that the use of oil was connected with the miraculous powers of healing, and therefore ceased \"when those powers ceased\" (cf. Bishop Browne on the Articles, p. 589). On the other hand, the passage is appealed to as warranting the Roman Catholic sacrament of extreme unction. With regard to the practice of the early Church, there is a constant stream of testimony to the use of oil for purposes of healing; e.g. the case in Tertullian already quoted, and many others in the fourth and fifth centuries (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' pp. 1455, 2004, 2053). ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as originally practiced it was administered by laymen and even by women.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) After the blessing of the oil was restricted to bishops it was still regarded as immaterial by whom the unction was performed. So Psalm-Innocent, 'Ep. ad Decent.,' § 8, \"Being made by the bishop, it is lawful not for priests only, but for all Christians, to use it in anointing in their own need or in that of their friends.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Not till the middle of the ninth century do we meet with any express injunction to the priest to perform the unction himself.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) \"The restraint of the unction to the priest had momentous consequences. The original intention of it in relation to healing of the body was practically forgotten, and the rite came to be regarded as part of a Christian's immediate preparation for death. Hence in the twelfth century it acquired the name of 'the last unction,' unctio extrema (Peter Lombard, ' Sent.,' 4:23), i.e. as the Catechism of Trent asserts ('De Extr. Unct.,' 3), the last of those which a man received from the Church. In the thirteenth it was placed by the schoolmen among the seven rites to which they limited the application of the term sacrament\" ('Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' p. 2004). In the sixteenth century it was definitely laid down at the Council of Trent,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that it is a sacrament instituted by our Lord;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that by it grace is conferred, sin remitted, and the sick comforted, \"sometimes also\" the recovery of health is obtained;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that it should be given to those in danger of death, but if they recover they may receive it again (Session 14. c. 9.). Further, the Catechism of the Council condemns as a grievous error the practice of waiting to anoint the sick \"until all hope of recovery being now lost, life begins to ebb, and the sick person to sink into lifeless insensibility.\" In spite of this, however, the common practice in the Roman Catholic Church at the present day appears to be to administer the rite only to persons in extremis. Turning now to the Eastern Church, we notice that a rite of unction has been continued there up till the present time. The service, which is a somewhat lengthy one, may be seen in Daniel's 'Codex Liturgicus,' bk. 4. c.v.; and cf. Neale's 'Holy Eastern Church,' Introd., vol. it. p. 1035, where it is noted that it differs from the Western use in three points:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the oil is not previously consecrated by the bishop, but at the time by seven priests;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the unction is not conferred only in extremis, but in slighter illness, and if possible in the church;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) it is not usually considered valid unless at least three priests are present to officiate. It has been thought well to give this slight historical sketch, as affording the best answer to the claims of Romanists by showing how they have gradually departed from the primitive custom and changed the character of the rite. But the sketch will also have shown that it is scarcely accurate to imply that unction ceased when the miraculous powers ceased. At the Reformation, when the English Church wisely rejected the mediaeval service for extreme unction, she yet retained in the first English Prayer-book a simple form of unction, to be used \"if the sick person desire it,\" consisting ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) anointing, \"upon the forehead or breast only,\" with the sign of the cross; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) prayer for the inward anointing of the soul with the Holy Ghost, and for restoration of bodily health and strength. Thus the service was entirely primitive in character, and it is hard to see what valid objection could be raised to it. It was, however, omitted from the second English Prayer-book of 1552, and has never been restored. The justification, I suppose, of this disuse of unction must be sought in the entire absence of evidence that the primitive Church understood the passage before us as instituting a religious rite to be permanently continued. All the earliest notices of unction refer simply to its use for healing purposes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTConfess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Confess therefore your sins, etc. The authority for the insertion of οῦν (omitted in the Received Text) is overwhelming (א, A, B, K, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic), as is also that for the substitution of τὰς ἁμαρτίας for τὰ παραπτώματα, which includes the three oldest manuscripts, א, A, B, the two latter of which also read προσεύχεσθε for εὔχεσθε. It is difficult to know exactly what to make of this injunction to confess \"one to another,\" which is stated in the form of an inference from the preceding. The form of the expression, \"one to another,\" and the perfectly general term, \"a righteous man,\" forbid us to see in it a direct injunction to confess to the clergy, and to the clergy only. But on the other hand, it is unfair to lose sight of the fact that it is directly connected with the charge to send for the elders of the Church. Marshall, in his' Penitential Discipline,' is perfectly justified in saying that St. James \"hath plainly supposed the presence of the elders of the Church, and their intercession to God for the sick penitent, and then recommended the confession of his faults in that presence, where two or three assembled together in the Name of Christ might constitute a Church for that purpose\" ('Penit. Discipline,' p. 80). We may, perhaps, be content with saying, with Bishop Jeremy Taylor, \"When St. James exhorts all Christians to confess their sins one to another, certainly it is more agreeable to all spiritual ends that this be done rather to the curate of souls than to the ordinary brethren\" ('Dissuasive from Popery,' II. 1:11; cf. Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 6. 4:5, 7). The effectual fervent prayer, etc.; rather, the petition of a righteous man availeth much in its working. On the distinction between δέησις the narrower, and προσευχή the wider word, see Trench on ' Synonyms,' p. 179.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - Illustration of the last statement of ver. 16, from the case of Elijah, \"a righteous man\" under the old covenant, but one \"of like passions with us,\" and therefore one from whose case it is lawful to argue to our own. Subject to like passions as we are. Ὁμοιοπαθὴς ἡμῖν: simply \"of like passions with us;\" cf. Acts 14:15, where it is used in just the same way. In the LXX. only in Wisd. 7:3. He prayed earnestly. Προσευχῇ προσηύξατο: a Hebraism, not infrequent in the New Testament (see Luke 22:15; John 3:29; Acts 4:17; Acts 5:28; Acts 23:14), in imitation of the Hebrew dissolute infinitive (cf. Winer, p. 584). For the incident alluded to by St. James, see 1 Kings 17:1; 1 Kings 18:1; but noteNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that we are never told that the famine was in consequence of Elijah's prayer; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) nothing is said of the duration of time (three years and a half) during which it rained not upon the earth. All we read is that \"after many days the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year;\" but there is no clear indication from what period this \"third year\" is dated. With regard toNEWLINENEWLINE(1), it may have been St. James's own inference from the narrative, or may have been due to tradition. With regard toNEWLINENEWLINE(2), the very same time is mentioned by our Lord in his allusion to the same incident (Luke 4:25), \"the heaven was shut up three years and six months.\" And as the same period is said to be given in the Yalkut Shimeoni on 1 Kings 16, it was probably the time handed down by tradition, being taken by the Jews as a symbol of times of tribulation (cf. Daniel 7:25; Daniel 12:7; Revelation 11:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBrethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Final exhortation; introduced, as was the opening one (James 1:2), by the emphatic \"my brethren.\" The Received Text omits μου, but it is found in א, A, B, K, Vulgate.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTJames5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Let him know. So א, A, K, L, Latt., Syriac, B has γινώσκετε, \"know ye.\" After ψυχὴν, א, A, and Vulgate add αὐτοῦ. B has it after θανάτου. And shall cover a multitude of sins (καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν). The same expression occurs in 1 Peter 4:8, \"Charity covereth a multitude of sins.\" It is founded on Proverbs 10:12, תְּכַסֶּה אַהֲבָה וְעַל כָּל־פְשָׁעִים, \"Love covereth all sins,\" where the LXX. goes entirely astray: Πάντας δὲ τοὺς μὴ φιλονεικοῦντας καλύπτει φιλία: but cf. Psalm 31:1; Psalm 84:3, in the LXX. It is difficult to believe that St. Peter and St. James independently hit upon the rendering πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν for the Hebrew כָּל־פְּשָׂעִים, as there was nothing to suggest it, the LXX. never rendering כֹּל by πλῆθος. Probably the one was consciously or unconsciously influenced by the other. The striking position which the words occupy here, as those with which the Epistle closes, would make them linger in the memory; and there is nothing to militate against the conclusion, which appeared probable on the occasion of previous coincidences between the two writers, that St. James is the earlier of the two (comp. on James 4:6). The expression used by the apostle leaves it undetermined whose sins are thus \"covered,\" whetherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) those of the man who is \"converted from the error of his way,\" orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) those of the man who wins him back, and through this good action obtains, by the grace of God, pardon for his own \"multitude of sins.\" It has been well noticed that \"there is a studied generality in the form of the teaching which seems to emphasize the wide blessedness of love. In the very act of seeking to convert one for whom we care we must turn to God ourselves, and in covering the past sins of another our own also are covered. In such an act love reaches its highest point, and that love includes the faith in God which is the condition of forgiveness\" (Plumptre). The Epistle ends abruptly, with no salutation and no doxology. In this it stands almost by itself in the New Testament; the First Epistle of St. John alone approaching it in the abruptness of its conclusion.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
