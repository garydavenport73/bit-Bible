{"Lev.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Nadab and Ahibu are said to have each taken his censer. This is the first time that the word used in the original is translated \"censer.\" It means any vessel or pan that will hold embers or tinder (see Exodus 25:38; Exodus 37:23; Exodus 38:3). They put fire therein, and put incense thereon. No doubt they used the incense ordered in Exodus 30:34. They are not found fault with for the incense, but for the fire that they used. They offered strange fire, that is, fire not taken from the altar of burnt offering, which they might have feared to approach after the miracle that had occurred. In chapter Leviticus 16:12 it is ordered that, on the Day of Atonement, the incense fire should be taken from the brazen altar, and this was no doubt the rule on all occasions, though the law has not been recorded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured. These are the exact words used in Leviticus 9:24 of the fire that consumed the sacrifices. The fire was the same; its source was the same; its effect was the same, and yet how different! They died before the Lord; that is, they were struck dead at the door of the tabernacle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This is that the Lord spake (see Exodus 19:22; Exodus 28:41; Exodus 29:44; Leviticus 8:33). God will be sanctified either by the obedience or by the punishment of those that come nigh him, that is, his priests. If they have greater privileges, they have greater perils (cf. Matthew 11:21). Aaron held his peace - in submission (see Psalm 39:9; Job 1:22), acknowledging that Moses had justified the act of God in executing so terrible a judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Uzziel was the youngest brother of Amram (see Exodus 6:18-22). His sons, Mishael and Elzaphan, were therefore second cousins of Nadab and Abihu, who are here called their brethren. (Cf. the use of the term \"brothers of the Lord,\" applied probably to his first cousins in the New Testament.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp. Their coats were the tunics which they had put on as their priestly attire (Leviticus 8:13). The lightning flash which had struck them down had not injured their clothes. As Mishael and Elzaphan became ceremonially defiled by contact with the corpses, and as the Passover was now at hand, it has been thought that it was in reference to their case that the concession was made, that those d, filed by a dead body might keep the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second instead of the first month (Numbers 9:6-11). The defilement caused by death ceased when Christ had died.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Uncover not your heads. They are to abstain from all the conventional signs of mourning, in order to show that they acknowledged the justice of the punishment. The whole house of Israel, that is, the people in general, might mourn the death of their priests, but the high priest and his remaining sons must prove their submission to the Divine chastisement by crushing their individual feelings of sorrow. A murmur on their part would have brought God's wrath on themselves and on the whole congregation, which they represented (Leviticus 4:3). Uncover not your heads may be otherwise translated, Let not your hair fall disheveled (see Leviticus 21:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The priests are not to be taken away from their duties at the door of the tabernacle, that is, the court in front of the tabernacle, even for the sake of burying their dead. They had now been in the court for eight days continuously, and they had to remain there until, in the fulfillment of their public function, they had eaten the sacrificial meal. Cf. Matthew 8:21, 22, \"Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto him, Follow me.\" God's service comes before all things.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:8-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINETO ABSTAIN FROM WINE (verses 8-11). The law given to Aaron (some manuscripts read Moses) against the use of wine by the priests during their ministrations, by its juxtaposition with what has gone before, has led to the probable supposition that Nadab and Abihu had acted under the excitement of intoxicating drink. It is possible that the sacrificial meals on the peace offerings had begun, and that at the same time that the congregation was feasting, the two priests had refreshed themselves with wine after their long service. The special ceremonial meal of the priests had not yet been eaten.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Wine and other intoxicating liquors (שֵׁכר, whence the Greek word σίκερα, Luke 1:13, was made from dates, or barley, or honey) are forbidden to the priests during their ministrations, that they may pat a difference between holy and unholy; that is, that their minds may not be confused, but be capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, what ought and what ought not to be done. Nadab and Abihu, on the contrary, had not distinguished between the sacred and profane fire, or between God's commands and their own unregulated impulses. If they had partaken too freely of the wine provided for the drink offerings, their sin would be similar to that of the Corinthians in their abuse of the Lord's Supper. As to the use of wine by the minister of God under the New Testament, see 1 Timothy 3:2, 8; 1 Timothy 5:23. The spiritual emotion, which, in the service of God, shows itself in pouring out the feelings in \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,\" is contrasted, in Ephesians 5:18, 19, with the physical excitement caused by wine, the former being commended and the latter forbidden.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - That ye may teach the children of Israel. This shows that one part of the priest's office was teaching the Law (cf. Deuteronomy 24:8; Malachi 2:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-20. - Moses takes care that the remaining part of the ritual of the day shall be carried out in spite of the terrible interruption that has occurred. Under his instructions, Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar eat the remainder of the meat offering (Leviticus 9:17), in the court of the tabernacle, and reserve the wave breast and heave shoulder to eat in a clean place, that is, not necessarily within the court; but he finds that the sin offerings (Leviticus 9:15), which ought to be eaten by the priests, had been burnt. The rule was that, when the blood was presented in the tabernacle, the flesh was burned; when it was not, the flesh was eaten by the priests. In the present case, the blood had not been brought within the holy place, and yet the flesh had been burned instead of being eaten. Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, and demanded an explanation. Aaron's plea of defense was twofold.NEWLINENEWLINE1. His sons had fulfilled aright the ritual of their own sin offering and burnt offering, that is, the offerings made for the priests, and it had been rather his duty than theirs to see that the ritual of the sin offering of the congregation had been properly carried out.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The state of distress in which he was, and the near escape that he had had from ceremonial defilement, and the sense of sin brought home to him by his children's death, had made him unfit and unable to eat the sin offering of the people, as he should have done under other circumstances. With this plea Moses was content. It was true that the letter of the Law had been broken, but there was a sufficient cause for it (see Hosea 6:6; Matthew 12:7). It appears from hence that the expiation wrought by the sin offering was not complete until the whole ceremony was accomplished, the last act of which was the eating of the flesh by the priests in one class of sin offering, and the burning the flesh outside the camp in the other. It has been questioned, what is the full meaning of the expression, God hath given it you - the flesh of the sin offering - to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord. Archdeacon Freeman expresses the view of A Lapide, Keil, and many others when he says that, by eating the flesh of the offering, the priests \"in a deep mystery neutralized, through the holiness vested in them by their consecration, the sin which the offerer had laid upon the victim and upon them\" ('Principles of Divine Service,' part 2). Oehler, on the other hand (Herzog's 'Cyclop.,' 10), maintains that the priests did no more by this act than declare the removal of the sin already taken away; with which accords Philo's explanation ('De Vict.,' 13, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 6.) that the object of the sacrificial meal was to carry assurance of acceptance to the offerer, \"since God would never have allowed his servants to partake of it had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin atoned for.\" Neither of these explanations seems to be altogether satisfactory. The former attributes more meaning to the expression bear the iniquity than it appears to have elsewhere; e.g. Exodus 28:38 and Numbers 18:1, where Aaron is said to bear the iniquity of the holy things and of the sanctuary; and Ezekiel 4:4-6, where the prophet is said to bear the iniquity of Israel and Judah. The latter interpretation appears too much to evacuate the meaning of the words. It is quite certain that the part of the ceremony by which the atonement was wrought (if it was wrought by any one part) was the offering of the blood for the covering of the offerer's sins, but yet this action of the priests in eating the flesh of the victim was in some way also connected with the atonement, not only with the assurance of its having been wrought; but in what way this was effected we are not told, and cannot pronounce. The words bear the iniquity are equivalent to making atonement for by taking the sin in some sense upon themselves (cf. Isaiah 53:11, \"He shall bear their iniquities,\" and John 1:29, \"Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away [or beareth] the sin of the world'). Accordingly, Bishop Patrick comments: \"The very eating of the people's sin offering argued the sins of the people were, in some sort, laid upon the priests, to be taken away by them. From whence the sacrifice of Christ may be explained, who is said to bear our iniquity (as the priest is here said to do), all our sins being laid on him, who took upon him to make an expiation for them by the sacrifice of himself. For the priest, hereby eating of the sin offering, receiving the guilt upon himself, may well be thought to prefigure One who should be both Priest and Sacrifice for sin; which was accomplished in Christ\" (on Leviticus 10:17).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Moses heard that, he was content.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron. Aaron, having now been consecrated high priest, is joined with Moses as the recipient of the laws on cleanness and uncleanness in Leviticus 11:1; Leviticus 13:1; Leviticus 14:33; Leviticus 15:1. His name is not mentioned in Leviticus 12:1; Leviticus 14:1; Leviticus 17:1; Leviticus 18:1; Leviticus 19:1; Leviticus 20:1; Leviticus 21:1, 16; Leviticus 22:1, 17, 26. Probably there is no signification in these omissions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - These are the beasts that ye shall eat. In order that the Israelites might know how to avoid the uncleanness arising from the consumption of unclean flesh, plain rules are given them by which they may distinguish what flesh is clean and what is unclean. The first rule is that anything that dies of itself is unclean, whether it be beast, bird, or fish. The reasons of this are plain: forNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the flesh still retains the blood, which no Israelite might eat; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) there is something loathsome in the idea of eating such flesh. Next, as to beasts, a class is marked off as edible by two plainly discernible characteristics, and instances are given to show that where there is any doubt owing to the animals possessing one of the characteristic marks only, the rule is to be construed strictly. As to fish and insects, equally plain rules, one in each case, are laid down; but as birds are not readily distinguished into large classes, the names of those that are unclean are given one by one, the remainder being all of them permissible. Thus the simple Israelite would run no risk of incurring uncleanness by inadvertently eating unclean food, whether of beast, bird, fish, or insect. The object of the regulations being to exclude all meats naturally offensive to the human taste, all carnivorous quadrupeds are shut out by the rule of chewing the cud (verse 3), with the same purpose, birds of prey and birds that eat offal are prohibited (verses 13-19), and scaleless fish on account of their repulsive appearance (verses 9-12), as well as beetles, maggots, and vermin of all sorts. In the case of beasts and fish, the rules laid down to mark off those things that are offensive, being general in their application, are such as to include in the forbidden class some few which do not appear naturally loathsome. This is owing partly to the difficulty of classification, partly to a change of feeling which experience has wrought in the sentiments of mankind with regard to such edibles as swine's flesh and shell-fish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, should rather be translated, Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and completely divides it, The camel parts but does not wholly divide the hoof, as there is ball at the back of the foot, of the nature of a heel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The coney, Hebrew, shaphan; the Hyrax Syriacus, or wabr, still called in Southern Arabia tsofun, a little animal similar to but not identical with the rabbit. \"They live in the natural caves and clefts of the rocks (Psalm 104:18), are very gregarious, being often seen seated in troops before the openings of their caves, and extremely timid, as they are quite defenseless (Proverbs 30:26). They are about the size of rabbits, of a brownish-gray or brownish-yellow color, but white under the belly; they have bright eyes, round ears, and no tail. The Arabs eat them, but do not place them before their guests\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof, There is little doubt that the same animal as our hare is meant. Neither the hare, however, nor the hyrax chews the cud in the strict sense of the words. But they have the appearance of doing so. The rule respecting chewing the cud was given to and by Moses as a legislator, not as an anatomist, to serve as a sign by which animals might be known to be clean for food. Phenomenal not scientific language is used here, as in Joshua 10:12, \"as we might speak of whales and their congeners as fish, when there is no need of scientific accuracy\" (Clark). \"All these marks of distinction in the Levitical law are wisely and even necessarily made on the basis of popular observation and belief, not on that of anatomical exactness. Otherwise the people would have been continually liable to error. Scientifically, the camel would be said to divide the hoof, and the hare does not chew the cud. But laws for popular use must necessarily employ terms as they are popularly understood. These matters are often referred to as scientific errors; whereas they were simply descriptions, necessarily popular, for the understanding and enforcement of the law\" (Gardiner).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted. Here, again, the description is not according to anatomical analysis, but to ordinary appearance. The pig appears to be cloven-footed, and it would be misleading to give any other account of his foot in ordinary speech, but scientifically speaking, he has four toes. The prohibition of the use of swine's flesh does not arise from the fear of trichinosis or other disease, but from the disgust caused by the carnivorous and filthy habits of the Eastern pig. The repulsion originally felt for swine's flesh was natural, and, where the animal is carnivorous, is still natural, but where its habits are changed, and it has become simply graminivorous, the feeling has ceased to exist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Of their carcass shall ye not touch. This prohibition is founded upon the same feeling of disgust as the prohibition of eating their flesh. Whatever is foal must be avoided.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - Whatsoever hath fins and scales. The absence of fins and scales, or their apparent absence - for phenomenal language is used, as before - gives to fish a repulsive look, on which is grounded the prohibition to eat them. Eels and shell-fish are thus forbidden, though a long course of experience has now taken away the feeling of repulsion with which they were once looked upon. The flesh of the beasts for, bidden to be eaten is only described as unclean, but that of the prohibited fish, birds, insects, and vermin, is designated as an abomination unto you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-19. - The unclean birds are those which are gross feeders, devourers of flesh or offal, and therefore offensive to the taste, beginning with the eagle and vulture tribe. It is probable that the words translated owl (verse 16), night hawk (verse 16), cuckow (verse 16) should be rendered, ostrich, owl, gull, and perhaps for swan (verse 18), heron (verse 19), lapwing (verse 19), should be substituted ibis, great plover, hoopoe. In the case of the bat, we have again phenomenal language used. Being generally regarded as a bird, it is classed with birds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the vulture, and the kite after his kind;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery raven after his kind;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-23. - All fowls that creep should rather be rendered all winged creeping things, that is, all flying insects. None are allowed except the Saltatoria, or locust family. The word translated beetle signifies a sort of locust, like the other three words. That the locust was a regular article of food in Palestine is amply proved. \"It is well known that locusts were eaten by many of the nations of antiquity, both in Asia and Africa, and even the ancient Greek thought the cicadas very agreeable in flavour (Arist. 'Hist. An.,' 5:30). In Arabia they are sold in the market, sometimes strung upon cords, sometimes by measure, and they are also dried and kept in bags for winter use.... They are generally cooked over hot coals, or on a plate, or in an oven, or stewed in butter, and eaten either with salt or with spice and vinegar, the head, wings, and feet being thrown away. They are also boiled in salt and water, and eaten with salt or butter. Another process is to dry them thoroughly, and then grind them into meal, and make cakes of them\" (Keil). (Cf. Matthew 3:4.) The expression goeth upon all four, means groveling or going in a horizontal position, in contrast with two-legged birds, just spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-28. - These verses contain an expansion of the warning contained in verse 8, to the effect that the touch of the dead bodies of the forbidden animals was defiling, as well as the consumption of their flesh. A further mark of an unclean animal is added in verse 27. Whatsoever goeth upon his paws; that is, whatever has not hoofs, but goes stealthily, like beasts of prey of the eat kind. It includes also dogs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - The creeping things that creep upon the earth. This class contains things that go on their belly, but have not wings, like the previous class of creeping things (verses 20-23). By the words translated tortoise, ferret, chameleon, lizard, snail, mole, different varieties of the lizard are probably meant.

They were to sanctify themselves, that is, to avoid uncleanness, because God is holy, and they were God's. They were thus taught that ceremonial cleanness of the body was a symbol of holiness of heart, and a means of attaining to the latter. For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt. It is possible that Egypt may be named as being the laud of animal-worship. To be your God; ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. The only way by which there can be communion between God and man is the way of holiness. Jewish industry and care has counted the number of letters in the Pentateuch, and marked by the use of the letter ו in larger type, in the word גָּחון, which occurs in verse 42, that that letter is the middle letter of the whole work from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Deuteronomy.

In accordance with these instincts, purifying rites are commanded for the restoration of those affected to ceremonial cleanness. These instincts and consequent regulations respecting women in childbirth are found in very many different nations. \"The Hindoo law pronounced the mother of a newborn child to be impure for forty days, required the father to bathe as soon as the birth had taken place, and debarred the whole family for a period from religious rites, while they were 'to confine themselves to an inward remembrance of the Deity;' in a Brahmin family this rule extended to all relations within the fourth degree, for ten days, at the end of which they had to bathe. According to the Parsee law, the mother and child were bathed, and the mother had to live in seclusion for forty days, after which she had to undergo other purifying rites. The Arabs are said by Burekhardt to regard the mother as unclean for forty days. The ancient Greeks suffered neither childbirth nor death to take place within consecrated places; both mother and child were bathed, and the mother was not allowed to approach an altar for forty days. The term of forty days, it is evident, was generally regarded as a critical one for both the mother and the child. The day on which the Romans gave the name to the child - the eighth day for a girl, and the ninth for a boy - was called lustrieus dies, 'the day of purification,' because certain lustral rites in behalf of the child were performed on the occasion, and some sort of offering was made. The amphidromia of the Greeks was a similar lustration for the child, when the name was given, probably between the seventh and tenth days\" (Clark).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-4. - She shall be unclean seven days. The mother is to be unclean seven days, and after that to be in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days (verse 4). The difference between these two states maybe seen by looking on to Leviticus 15:19-28, and comparing that passage with verse 4 of this chapter. In the first stage, during the seven days, she made all that she touched unclean; in the second stage, during the thirty-three days, she was only required to touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, as she was progressing towards cleanness. The number of days during which she is to be altogether unclean is to be according to the days of the separation for her infirmity, that is, seven days, as in the case of her monthly courses (see Leviticus 15:19). In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. The Levitical legislation recognizes the regulation as to the day of the circumcision made at the time of the covenant with Abraham. \"And he that is eight days old (or a son of eight days) shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations\" (Genesis 17:12). Until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. \"When in a state of impurity, the Hebrews were forbidden to enter the sanctuary, to keep the Passover, and to partake of holy food, whether of sacrificial meat, of sacred offerings and gifts, or of shew-bread, because the clean only were fit to approach the holy God and all that appertains to him (Leviticus 7:19-21; Leviticus 22:3; Numbers 9:6; Numbers 18:11; 1 Samuel 21:5)' (Kalisch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks;... and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. The reason why the duration of the mother's uncleanness is twice as long at a girl's birth as at a boy's, would appear to be that the uncleanness attached to the child as well as to the mother, but as the boy was placed in a state of ceremonial purity at once by the act of circumcision, which took place on the eighth day, he thereupon ceased to be unclean, and the mother's uncleanness alone remained; whereas in the case of a girl, both mother and child were unclean during the period that the former was \"in the blood of her purifying,\" and therefore that period had to be doubly long. See Luke 2:20, where the right reading is, \"When the days of their purification, according to the Law of Moses, were accomplished.\" For eight days the infant Saviour submitted to legal uncleanness in \"fulfilling all righteousness\" (Matthew 3:15), and therefore the whole forty days were spoken of as \"the days of their purification.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - The previous verses having stated the conditions and the term of continuance of the uncleanness arising from childbirth, the three final verses describe the offerings to be made by the woman for her purification. She shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering. Two things are noticeable here: first, that the burnt offering, symbolizing self-devotion, is far more costly and important than the sin offering, which had not to be offered for any individual personal sin, but only for human sin, \"which had been indirectly manifested in her bodily condition\" (Keil); and secondly, that in this one case the sin offering appears to succeed the burnt offering instead of preceding it. No doubt the changed order is owing to the cause just mentioned; the idea of sin, though it may not be altogether put aside (Genesis 3:16), is not to be prominent, as though it were peculiar to the special woman who was purified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.

A concession is made to poverty, which in later times appears to have been largely acted on. It was, as we know, taken advantage of by the mother of our Lord (Luke 2:24).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEUNCLEANNESS DERIVED FROM LEPROSY OR CONTACT WITH LEPERS AND LEPROUS THINGS (chapters 13, 14). A third cause of uncleanness is found in a third class of offensive or repulsive objects. There is no disease which produces so foul an appearance in the human form as leprosy. There was, therefore, no disease so suitable for creating ceremonial, because representing spiritual, uncleanness. The name leprosy has been made to cover a number of diseases similar but not identical in character. There are many spurious forms of leprosy, and many diseases akin to leprosy which do not now come under discussion. The disease here dealt with is elephantiasis, especially in its anesthetic form, which is otherwise called white leprosy. The two varieties of elephantiasis - the tuberculated and the anesthetic - are, however, so closely connected together that they cannot be separated, the one. often running into the other. The first symptom of the malady is a painless spot, which covers an indolent ulcer. This ulcer may continue unprogressive for months or for years, during which the person affected is able to do his ordinary business; but at the end of these periods, whether longer or shorter, it produces a more repulsive and foul disfigurement of the human face and frame than any known disease, the features of the face changing their character, and part of the body occasionally mortifying and dropping off. Death at last comes suddenly, when a vital part of the body has been affected. The home of leprosy has in all ages been Syria and Egypt and the countries adjacent to them, but Europe has not escaped the scourge. In the Middle Ages, no European country was free from it; London had at one time six leper houses; cases were found not unfrequently in Scotland till the middle of the last century; and there was a death certified by medical science to have resulted from leprosy in the city of Norwich in the year 1880. The object of the regulations relating to leprosy is no more sanitary than of those relating to unclean meats. Like the latter, they may have served a sanitary purpose, for leprosy is, according to the prevailing medical opinion, slightly, though only slightly, contagious. Because leprosy was hideous and foul, it therefore made the man affected by it unclean, and before he could be restored to communion with God and his people, he must be certified by God's priest to be delivered from the disease. As in the previous cases, physical ugliness and defilement represent spiritual depravity and viciousness. \"The Levitical law concerning leprosy reveals to us the true nature of sin. It shows its hideousness and its foulness, and fills us with shame, hatred, and loathing for it. And it reveals to us the inestimable benefit which we have received from the incarnation of the Son of God, 'the Sun of Righteousness, with healing in his wings' (Malachi 4:2); and fills us with joy, thankfulness, and love to him for his infinite goodness to us\" (Wordsworth). Leprosy, the most loathsome of all common diseases, is the type and symbol of sin, and the ceremonial uncleanness attaching to it is a parable of the moral foulness of sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The word translated plague of leprosy literally means stroke. It seems to be used in the sense of spot. Then shall he be brought unto Aaron the priest. That the regulations respecting leprosy were not sanitary arrangements, as has been sometimes represented, is indicated by the authority over the leper being vested in the priest rather than in the physician, and the question of whether a man was a leper or no being decided by the former rather than the latter. It is to be noted also that the priest is not made unclean by his contact with the leper, because he is in the performance of his duty. The supposed leper may be brought either to Aaron or unto one of his sons the priests; that is, to the high priest or to the ordinary priest, and those descendants of Aaron who were disqualified by physical infirmities from officiating at the altar were permitted to act as examiners in leprosy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When the hair in the plague is turned white. This is the first symptom, and the most noticeable as the commencement of the disease. The hair around the spot loses its colour and becomes thin and weak, the separate hairs being hardly stronger or individually thicker than down. The second symptom is when the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh; that is, below the upper skin, or cuticle, and in the real cutis. These two symptoms distinguish real leprosy from other affections which at first bear a similar appearance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-8. - In case the symptoms are not decisive, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days. The words thus translated would perhaps be better rendered, then the priest shall bind up the part affected for seven days. The priest is to delay his judgment for a week, and, if necessary, for a second week, during which period the patient is, according to the rendering, either to be confined to his house or, more probably, to have the spot bandaged. Whether the disease be or be not leprosy will probably have declared itself by the end of that time; and if the plague be somewhat dark on the fourteenth day, that is, if it has begun to lose its colour and to fade away, and has not spread in the skin, the priest is to decide that it is not real leprosy, and pronounce the man clean. He is still, however, to be kept under supervision, and if the spot is found to spread, he is to be pronounced unclean, as it is proved to be a leprosy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - The method of procedure in the case of a doubtful leprosy having been laid down in the previous verses, the rule for dealing with an unmistakable case is here given. When the characteristic white spot and white hair are present (if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white), and if a third symptom be present - if there be quick raw flesh in the rising, that is, if there be an ulcer underneath the white scab, there is to be no delay, as in the previous case, but judgment is to be passed at once.

There was a form of disease similar to true leprosy, and bearing the name of leprosy, and by some thought to be the final phase of true leprosy, which was yet not to cause legal uncleanness. It was distinguishable from the leprosy which caused uncleanness by a diffusion of the white flakes over the whole body, and by the absence of any patches bearing the appearance of raw flesh (verses 12, 13). Real leprosy might pass into this harmless kind or phase, and it was known to have done so as soon as the raw patches of flesh had disappeared (verses 16, 17). When this had taken place, the priest pronounced him clean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-23. - The method of discriminating between a leprous spot and the reappearing scar of an old ulcer.

If there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning. This rendering indicates that the authors of the Authorized Version thought a disease of the nature of a carbuncle to be meant; but it is better to take the words literally as they are translated in the margin, If there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a burning of fire; that is, a scar from a burn, The leprous spot and the scar are to be distinguished as in the previous case. An old nicer or burn is a more likely place for a leprous spot to appear than any part of the body which is sound, just as in the moral sphere sin fixes on some old wound of the soul to burst out in.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-37. - The method of discriminating between a leprous spot on the head or beard and an ulcer in the same place.

This is \"the harmless bohak (ἀλφός, LXX.), which did not defile, and which even the Arabs, who still call it bahak, consider harmless.

Though leprosy makes the hair drop off around the leprous spot, baldness is in itself no sign of leprosy, whether at the back or front of the head (verses 40, 41); but as the bald head is a not unusual place for the leprous spot to appear, any eruption upon it is therefore to be watched and tested as before.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 45, 46. - The cases for examination having been discussed, the law for the treatment of the man in whom leprosy has been proved to exist is pronounced. The leper in whom the plague is to be ex-eluded from the camp, lest others should contract defilement from him. He is for the same reason to cry, Unclean, unclean, lest any wayfarer should unwittingly come in contact with him; and his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, these being the signs of mourning for the dead. The bared or disheveled head (see chapter Leviticus 10:6) and the covered lip are incidentally mentioned as signs of mourning in Ezekiel 24:17, and the covered upper lip as a mark of shame in Micah 3:7. By the expression, He shall dwell alone, is meant he shall dwell apart from those who were clean. Of course, lepers would naturally associate with each other, and so we find that they actually did (Luke 17:12). As their presence was supposed to defile any place that they entered, they were punished in later times with forty stripes if they did not observe the restraints laid down for them. \"They were, however, admitted to the synagogue, where a place was railed off for them, ten handbreadths high and four cubits wide, on condition of their entering the house of worship before the rest of the congregation and leaving it after them\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The exclusion of the leper was not for the purpose of avoiding contagion, nor to serve as a penalty for having contracted so loathsome a disease, but primarily to prevent the spread of ceremonial uncleanness communicated by his touch, and typically and mystically to teach that the fate brought upon a man by unremoved sin is separation from the people of God here and hereafter.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus13:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - Whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment.

If the priest judges that it is leprosy, he is to burn the garment, if not, to tear out the piece affected, whether it be in the warp, or in the woof, that is, in whatever part it appears, and to wash the remainder twice.

This is the most minute of all the forms of purification, those for purification from contact with a dead body (Numbers 19) and for the cleansing of a defiled Nazarite (Numbers 6) being alone to be compared with it in this respect. Some purifications were accomplished, as we have seen, in a very summary manner: one who touched the carcass of a beast that had died a natural death had only to wash his clothes (Leviticus 11:40). The greater and more significative the defilement, the more careful and the more significative must be the cleansing. Leprous uncleanness excluded the leper both from the camp and from the sanctuary, from the rights both of citizen. ship and of Church-membership, with which the rights of the family were also associated; consequently there had to be a double form of restoration, each with its special ceremonies. The manner of the first reconciliation is detailed in verses 1-8, of the second in verses 9-32.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing. The ceremonies in the first stage of cleansing, which restored the outcast to the common life of his fellows, were the following:NEWLINENEWLINE1. The priest formally examined the leper outside the camp, and made up his mind that he was clean.NEWLINENEWLINE2. An earthen vessel was brought with fresh water, and one of two birds was killed, and its blood was allowed to run into this water.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The other bird was taken and dipped in the vessel, with a piece of cedar wood and hyssop, which had first been tied together by a band of scarlet wool; and the leper was sprinkled seven times with the blood and water dripping from the feathers of the living bird.NEWLINENEWLINE4. The priest pronounced the man clean.NEWLINENEWLINE5. The bird was let fly into the open field.NEWLINENEWLINE6. The man washed his clothes, shaved his whole body, and bathed.NEWLINENEWLINE7. He returned within the camp, but not yet to his tent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The priest. The agent is stilt the priest, not the physician. The priest shall go forth out of the camp. \"May we not (as Hesychius suggests) see a figure here of the compassion of our Great High Priest, who has gone forth out of heaven itself, the camp of angel hosts, and has come down to earth, not only to examine but to heal the moral leprosy of sin, 'to seek and to save the lost' (Luke 19:10), and who carefully examines and scrutinizes all the secrets of all hearts (Hebrews 4:12)? And he was exempt from all contagion of sin while he lived and moved among sinners (Matthew 9:11; Luke 15:1), and was 'holy, harmless, and undefiled' (Hebrews 7:26)\" (Wordsworth). And the priest shall look. In later times it was ordered that the examination was not to take place on the sabbath, nor in the early morning, nor in the late afternoon, nor inside a house, nor on a cloudy day, nor in the glare of midday, and that the priest must have good eyesight, and only determine one case at a time; nor was he allowed to pronounce judgment on his own kindred. And, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper. The plague of leprosy is healed before the ceremony of purification begins, but the leper is not pronounced clean until he has been sprinkled with the blood and water (verse 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. \"Cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet ' are also to be burnt with the red heifer for the ashes for the water of separation (Numbers 19:6), and they appear to have been commonly employed in purifications (Hebrews 9:19). The antiseptic properties of cedar made it peculiarly suitable for such occasions. The hyssop \"was probably not the plant which we call hyssop, the Hyssopus officinalis. for it is uncertain whether this is to be found in Syria and Arabia, but a species of origanum resembling hyssop, the Arabian zater, either wild marjoram, or a kind of thyme\" (Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschExodus 12:21). The Psalmist's cry, \"Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be chart\" (Psalm 51:7), shows the common use to which it was put. In the present case, the sweet smell both of the wood (one cubit's length of which was used) and of the herb would have still further adapted them for symbolizing the redemption of the leper's flesh from corruption and putrefaction. The scarlet was probably a band of scarlet wool with which the cedar and the hyssop were tied - not to the bird (for we have no account of their being after, wards removed), but (as in the burning of the red heifer) one to the other. The colour of the wool was appropriate, not only because it was about to be dipped in the blood and water, but also because it symbolized the purified and now healthy blood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - One of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water. A small quantity of water was placed in an earthenware dish, and one of the birds was killed over the dish in such a way that the blood dripped into the water. The water was needed, as there would not have been sufficient blood in the bird for the seven sprinklings which were to be made. It was to be running, literally, living, water; that is, fresh water taken from a fountain or a running stream, in order that it might be as pure as possible. Symbolically, the cleansing power of water as well as of blood is indicated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - As for the living bird, he shall take it. The wings and tail of the bird were extended, and in this position it was dipped into the blood and water in the earthenware dish, and with it, the bunch made up of cedar, hyssop, and scarlet wool.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times. It is not certain whether the seven sprinklings were made upon the forehead of the person to be cleansed, or on the back of his hand. The feathers of the bird and the bunch of hyssop would be specially instrumental in the seven sprinklings. And shall pronounce him clean. Having assured himself that he was healed (verse 3), the priest now pronounces him to be clean, he looses as well as binds. It had been his office to declare the man a leper, and thereby to shut him out from the people of the Lord (Leviticus 13:8, 15, 22, 25, 36, 44, 46). Now he pronounces him to be no leper, and therefore, after some further ceremonies, readmits him (verses 8, 20, 31). And shall let the living bird loose into the open field. The symbolism of the two birds, which has been much misinterpreted, is essentially the same as that of the two goats on the day of atonement, though each ceremony has its distinctive features. The killing of the living bird was not a true sacrifice, as was the offering of the goat to Jehovah, but by its death it represented the state in which the leper had legally been, and to which he would have been physically reduced had not a remedy been found. The deathly and unclean state of the leper having been symbolically transferred from the dead bird to the living bird by the latter's being sprinkled in the former's blood, the living bird stands in the position of the scapegoat, on whom the sins of the people were laid. The bird is then let loose into the open field; literally, upon the face of the field; and it flies off, carrying with it the leper's uncleanness, and assuring him by every forward movement that it makes that the living death has passed from him, just as each step or' the scapegoat appeared to the Israelites to remove their sins from them. A large number of commentators, on the other hand, consider the released bird to symbolize the health and freedom now given back to the leper, and they dwell on the rapid and uncontrolled movement of birds as being peculiarly suitable for representing this recovered liberty. But this interpretation, to which there are many objections, appears to be altogether incompatible with the fact that the same ceremony is used in the cleansing of the leprous house, whereas the house could certainly not be represented as \"recovered to unrestrained liberty\" (Lunge). The common patristic view, that the two birds represent the two natures of the one Great Sacrifice offered to redeem man from sin, seems to be out of place here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - After the healed leper has washed his clothes, and shaved off all his hair, and washed himself with water, so as to leave no remnant of his former defilement that can be removed, the first stage of his purification is over. He is restored to the camp, but not yet to the sanctuary, nor to his position as head or member of his family. He has still to undergo another week's purgation, and until that time has elapsed he may not live in his tent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-32. - The ceremonies in the second stage of cleansing, which restored the late outcast to his home and to his covenant-right, were the following;NEWLINENEWLINE1. At the end of seven days he repeated the process of washing, shaving, and bathing.NEWLINENEWLINE2. On the eighth day he brought a lamb for a trespass offering, a leg of oil, a meat offering, a sin offering, and a burnt offering.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The priest that officiated at the cleansing presented him and his offerings at the door of the tabernacle.NEWLINENEWLINE4. He offered the trespass offering and the log of oil for him.NEWLINENEWLINE5. He slew the trespass offering and put some of the blood of it on different parts of the man's body.NEWLINENEWLINE6. He poured some of the oil into his left hand, and having sprinkled some of it seven times before the Lord, he placed some of it on those parts of the man's body on which the blood had been placed, and poured the rest upon his head.NEWLINENEWLINE7. He offered the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the meat offering. Verse 9. - But it shall be on the seventh day. The pause for seven days, followed by placing the blood on the tip of the right ear, and on the thumb of the right hand, and on the great toe of the right foot, and the subsequent anointing with off, irresistibly call to mind the ceremonies of the consecration of priests (Leviticus 8:35, 23, 24, 12, 30), and no doubt they are intended to do so. The whole nation was in a sense a priestly nation, and the restoration of the lapsed member to his rights was therefore a quasi-consecration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - On the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour. Every sacrifice is to be provided and offered by the restored leper, except the peace offering. It is certainly singular that the peace offering should be omitted, and that the trespass offering should be required. The former fact may be accounted for by the supposition that though the peace offering was not required, the late leper was, after his other sacrifices, put in a position where he might offer it when he would of his own free will. But the requirement of the trespass offering is more difficult to explain. What wrong had the leper done? and what satisfaction had he to make? The usual answer to this question is that he had wronged Jehovah in that, however involuntarily, he had failed to bring him the offerings and service which he would have brought had he not been excluded from the camp. But this is a very forced explanation, and it is incompatible with other parts of the Law. For the leper was not the only unclean person who, owing to his uncleanness, was prevented from offering his gifts and worship at the tabernacle or temple. The woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years (Luke 8:43) during that time would have been excluded from the sanctuary. But no trespass offering is required of those that have been unclean through issues. We must therefore, look for some other explanation of the requirement in the case of the cleansed leper. And a simpler one is at hand. Leprosy was the type of sin - or all sin whatsoever. When, therefore, the expiatory sacrifices were demanded, both kinds - the trespass offering and the sin offering - had to be offered, because expiation had to be made for the uncleanness which represented all unrighteousness - trespasses as well as sins. It might be that the man had not committed a trespass; he might also not hive committed sin; but he had been stricken with the foul disease which symbolized both one and the other, and therefore he had to offer on his cleansing the sacrifice appropriate to each. There is a difference in the ritual of the trespass offering in the present ease, intended perhaps to distinguish it from those trespass offerings which were made when a man had in his mind a certain wrong or injury which he had committed, and for which he wished to make compensation. On this occasionNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the animal presented was not required to be of a particular value, as in the ordinary trespass offerings;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) it was waved, whereas the ordinary trespass offerings were not waved;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) it was waved by the priest, whereas other wave offerings were waved not by the priest, but by the offerer, whose bands were guided by the priests. NorNEWLINENEWLINE(4) did the offering of oil accompany the presentation of other trespass offerings. For whatever reason it be, the most characteristic feature of the sacrificial cleansing of the leper is the trespass offering, and the way that it was dealt with.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The log of oil, amounting to something more than half a pint, is waved by the priest, together with the lamb for the trespass offering, as a wave offering before the Lord, in order that a special consecration may be given them. They thus become qualified for the purposes for which they are presently used.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed. The Mishna describes the ceremony as follows: - \"The leper stands before the trespass offering, lays his hand upon it and kills it. Two priests catch up the blood one in a vessel, the other in his band. He who catches it up in the vessel goes and throws it on the side of the altar, and he who catches it in his hand goes and stands before the leper. And the leper who had previously bathed in the court of the lepers, goes and stands in the gate of Nicanor. Rabbi Jehudah says he needs not bathe. He thrusts in his head (viz. into the great court, which he may not yet enter), and the priest puts of the blood upon the tip of his ear; he thrusts in his hand, and he puts it upon the thumb of his hand; he thrusts in his foot, and he puts it upon the great toe of his foot\" ('Negaim,' 14:7, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 18.). No doubt, the ear, the thumb, and the great toe are selected for the purpose of showing, as in the case of the consecration of the priest, that the senses and the active powers of the restored Israelite must be dedicated hence, forth to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand. This ceremony is altogether peculiar to this purification. The joint use of blood and oil is not singular (see Leviticus 8:30), but elsewhere there is no sprinkling of the oil... seven times before the Lord, and in the consecration of priests there was no anointing of the different members with oil as well as with blood. The Mishua (as before cited) continues the description of the ceremony as follows: - \"The priest now takes from the log of oil and pours it into the palm of his colleague, though if he poured it into his own it were valid. He dips his finger and sprinkles seven times towards the holy of holies, dipping each time he sprinkles. He goes before the leper, and on the spot where he had put the blood he puts the oil, as it is written, 'Upon the blood of the trespass offering.' And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand, he pours on the head of him that is cleansed, for an atonement; if he so puts it, he is atoned for, but if not, he is not atoned for. So Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Jochanan, the son of Nuri, saith, This is only the remnant of the ordinance, whether it be done or not, the atonement is made; but they impute it to him (the priest), as if he had not made atonement.\" The double sprinkling with blood and oil betokened dedication as in the case of the priests, the blood specially denoting reconciliation, and the oil the strengthening power of God by which the new life was to be led.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - The priest shall offer the sin offering.

The subject of leprosy in houses must be regarded from the same point of view as that of leprosy in clothes. The regulations respecting it are not sanitary laws, as Lange represents them, but rest, as Keil argues, upon an ideal or symbolical basis. The same thought is attached to all species of uncleanness. Something - it matters not what - produces a foul and repulsive appearance in the walls of a house. That is in itself sufficient to make that house unclean; for whatever is foul and repulsive is representative of moral and spiritual defilement, and therefore is itself symbolically defiling and defiled. It has been suggested that the special cause of the affection of the houses in Canaan was saltpetre exuding from the materials employed in their building, or iron pyrites in the stone used. This may have been so, or more probably it was the growth of some fungus. Whatever it was, the appearance created by it was so similar to that of leprosy in the human body, as to derive its name from the latter by analogy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession. This is the first instance of a law being given which has no bearing on the present condition of the Israelites. but is to regulate their conduct when they had come into the promised land. From the time of Abraham downwards, the assurance of their entrance into that land had been possessed by the people of Israel (Genesis 17:8), and the expectation of the speedy fulfillment of that promise had been quickened by their exodus from Egypt, and the preparations made to march through the wilderness. There would, therefore, be nothing surprising to them in receiving instructions to guide their conduct when the entrance should have been effected. As the question is one of leprosy, it is natural that it should be treated of with the leprosy of the human subject and the leprosy of garments; but as it is not of immediate application, it is placed at the end, and dealt with after the rest of the subject has been discussed, being appended to the law of cleansing the leper, instead of preceding it. And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession. This expression has led to the idea that the leprosy of houses was a special infliction at God's hand in a manner different flora other inflictions or diseases; but the words do not mean that. All that is done is in a sense done by God, inasmuch as his providence rules over all; and, therefore, by whatever secondary cause a thing may be brought about, it is he that does it. It is God that feeds the birds (Luke 12:24), God that clothes the grass (Luke 12:28), nor does one sparrow fall to the ground without him (Matthew 10:29). It is he, therefore, that puts the plague in a house, as the Lord of all things (cf. Isaiah 45:6, 7, \"I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things\"). The expression militates, though not strongly, against the notion that the house caught the leprosy from the leper that lived in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-44. - The examination of the suspected house by the priest. First, the house is to be emptied of its furniture, lest the latter should contract a ceremonial uncleanness in case the house were found to be leprous, but not, it will be noted, lest it should convey contagion or infection. Then the priest is to examine the discolouration, and if it bear a suspicious appearance, the house is to be shut up for seven days. It at the end of that time the spot has spread, he is to have the part of the wall in which it shows itself taken down and carried away, and built up again with new stones and mortar and plaster, the parts adjoining to the infected place having been first well scraped. If this treatment does not succeed in getting rid of the mischief, the priest is to determine that it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - As the leper was removed from the camp, so the leprous house is to be utterly pulled down; the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and all its materials carried forth eat of the city into an unclean place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 46, 47. - The leprous house conveys uncleanness to those that enter it, but of so slight a nature that it ceases with the evening, and requires only that the clothes of the wearer be washed. Such a regulation would have been ineffectual for preventing the spread of infection, if that had been its purpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 48-53. - The ceremony of cleansing the house is as similar to that of cleansing the leper as circumstances will permit. In case there is no reappearance of the mischief after the new stones and plastering have been put in, the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. First, the priest assures himself that the plague is healed, then he pronounces the house clean, and still after that the cleansing is to take place (cf. verses 3, 7, 8). The cleansing is effected by the same ceremony as that of the leper himself, by the two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. The use of this ceremony in the cleansing of a house shows that, in the case of the leper, the symbolical meaning of letting go the living bird out of the city into the open fields cannot be, as has been maintained, the restoration of the cleansed man to his natural movements of liberty in the camp. If a bird's flight represents the freedom of a man going hither and thither as he will, it certainly does not represent any action that a house could take.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus14:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 54-57. - These verses contain the concluding formula for chapters 13, 14.

THE CEREMONIAL PURIFICATION OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION ON THE GREAT DAY OF ATONEMENT. This chapter, containing the account of the institution of the ceremonial to be used on the Day of Atonement, would take its place chronologically immediately after the tenth chapter, for the instructions conveyed in it were delivered to Moses \"after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord and died\" (verse 1), when the fate of Nadab and Abihu would naturally have led Aaron to desire a more perfect knowledge than had as yet been imparted to him as to the manner in which he was to present himself before the Lord. Logically it might either occupy its present position, as being the great and culminating atoning and cleansing ceremony, or it might be relegated to a place among the holy days in chapter 23, where it is, in fact, shortly noticed. That it is placed here shows that the most essential characteristic of the Day in the judgment of the legislator is that of its serving as the occasion and the means of \"making an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and making an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and for making an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation\" (verse 33). Annually there gathered over the camp, and over the sanctuary as situated in the midst of the camp, a mass of defilement, arising in part from sins whose guilt had not been removed by the punishment of the offenders, and in part from uncleannesses which had not been cleansed by sacrifices and the prescribed ceremonial rites. Annually this defilement had to be atoned for or covered away from the sight of God. This was done by the solemn observance of the great Day of Atonement, and specially by the high priest's carrying the blood of the sacrifices into the holy of holies, into which he might enter on no other day of the year; while the consciousness of deliverance from the guilt of sin was quickened on the part of the people by their seeing the scapegoat \"bear away upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited\" (verse 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not. Nadab and Abihu having died for their rash presumption in venturing unbidden into the tabernacle, it was natural that Aaron, who had as yet but once penetrated into the holy of holies, should be struck with fear, and that he should desire Divine instruction as to the times and manner in which he was to appear before the Lord, lest he should be struck dead like his sons. If the attempt to enter the outer chamber of the tabernacle had been so fatal to them, what might not be the result to him of entering within the vail which hung before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark? The mercy-seat - capporeth, ἱλαστήριον, propitiatorium - formed the top of the ark, and was the place where God specially exhibited his Presence, on the occasions of his manifestation, by the bright cloud which then rested upon it between the cherubim. It was this Presence which made it perilous for Aaron to appear within the vail unbidden or without the becoming ritual; for man might not meet God unless he were sanctified for the purpose (Exodus 19:14, 21-24; 1 Samuel 6:19). The words, for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat, refer to the Divine Presence thus visibly manifested (see 1 Kings 8:10-12), and not, as they have strangely been misinterpreted, to the cloud of smoke raised by the incense burnt by the high priest on his entrance. They do not, however, prove that the manifestation was constantly there, still less that it was continued, according to Jewish tradition, in later times. \"The reason for the prohibition of Aaron's entrance at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice, is to be found in the fact that the holiness communicated to the priest did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the performance of his official duties; and so long as the Law, which produced only the knowledge of sin, and not its forgiveness and removal, was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one could stand\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3 - Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place. \"Thus\" would be translated more literally by With this. He must come supplied with the specified offerings, dressed in the appointed manner and using the ceremonial here designated. The efficacy of the acts of the high priest on this day and throughout his ministrations depended not upon his individual but on his official character, and on his obedience to the various commandments positively enjoined. Personal worthiness would not qualify him for his service, nor personal unworthiness hinder the effect of his liturgical acts (cf. Art. 26, 'Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament'). Aaron's special offerings for himself on this great day are to be a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His special garments for the occasion are the holy linen coat,... the linen breeches,... a linen girdle,... and the linen mitre. In the original the definite article is not expressed. The reading should therefore be, He shall put on a holy linen coat, and he shall have linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with a linen mitre shall be attired. The clothing was white from head to foot, differing therein from the dress of the ordinary priest, inasmuch as the sash or girdle of the latter was of variegated materials, and differing also in the shape of the mitre. The white clothing was not intended to symbolize humility and penitence, as some have thought, for white is not the colour in which penitents are naturally dressed. Rather it was symbolical of the purity and holiness which the ceremonies of the day symbolically affected, and which was specially needed to be exhibited in the person of the high priest. In the visions of Ezekiel and Daniel, the angel of God is clothed in linen (Ezekiel 9:2, 3, 11; Ezekiel 10:2, 6, 7; Daniel 10:5; Daniel 12:6, 7). And the colour of the angelic raiment is described in the Gospels as white: \"his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow\" (Matthew 28:3); \"they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment\" (Mark 16:5); \"two men stood by them in shining garments\" (Luke 24:4); she \"seeth two angels in white sitting\" (John 20:12). So, too, the wife of the Lamb, in the Book of the Revelation, has it \"granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints\" (Revelation 19:7, 8). The white linen dress of the high priest, therefore (which must have given the appearance of the English surplice tied in at the waist), was intended to symbolize the purity and brightness which forms the characteristic of angels and saints, and, above all, of the King of saints. \"The white material of the dress which Aaron wore when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of his nature, effected by himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by his own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us and obtain everlasting redemption (Hebrews 1:3; Hebrews 7:26; Hebrews 9:12, 24)\" (Keil). The symbolism of the holy garments as indicating holiness and purity, is strengthened by the command that Aaron is to wash his flesh in water, and so put them on. The high priest's acts on this day, so far as they are recounted in this chapter, were the following.NEWLINENEWLINE1. He bathed.NEWLINENEWLINE2. He dressed himself in his white holy garments.NEWLINENEWLINE3. He offered or presented at the door of the tabernacle a bullock for a sin offering for himself and his house.NEWLINENEWLINE4. He presented at the same place two goats for a sin offering for the congregation.NEWLINENEWLINE5. He cast lots on the two goats, one of which was to be sacrificed, the other to he let go into the wilderness.NEWLINENEWLINE6. He sacrificed the bullock.NEWLINENEWLINE7. He passed from the court through the holy place into the holy of holies with a censer and incense, and filled the space beyond the vail with a cloud of smoke from the incense.NEWLINENEWLINE8. He returned to the court, and, taking some of the blood of the bullock, passed again within the vail, and there sprinkled the blood once on the front of the mercy-seat and seven times before it.NEWLINENEWLINE9. He came out again into the court, and killed the goat on which the lot for sacrifice had fallen.NEWLINENEWLINE10. For the third time he entered the holy of holies, and went through the same process with the goat's blood as with the bullock's blood.NEWLINENEWLINE11. He purified the other part of the tabernacle, as he had purified the holy of holies, by sprinkling with the atoning blood, as before, and placing some of it on the horns of the altar of incense (Exodus 30:10).NEWLINENEWLINE12. He returned to the court, and placed the blood of the bullock and goat upon the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice, and sprinkled it seven times.NEWLINENEWLINE13. He offered to God the remaining goat, laying his hands upon it, confessing and laying the sins of the people upon its head.NEWLINENEWLINE14. He consigned the goat to a man, whose business it was to conduct it to the border of the wilderness, and there release it.NEWLINENEWLINE15. He bathed and changed his linen vestments for his commonly worn high priest's dress.NEWLINENEWLINE16. He sacrificed, one after the other, the two rams as burnt offerings for himself and for the people.NEWLINENEWLINE17. He burnt the fat of the sin offerings upon the altar.NEWLINENEWLINE18. He took measures that the remainder of the sin offerings should be burnt without the camp. In Numbers 29:7-11, twelve sacrifices are commanded to be offered by the high priest on this day, namely, the morning and evening sacrifice; a burnt offering for the people, consisting of one young bullock, one ram (as already stated), and seven lambs; and cue goat for a sin offering; so that in all there were fifteen sacrifices offered, besides the meat and drink offerings. The punctiliousness of the Jews in later times was not content that the ceremonies should begin on the day itself. Preparations commenced a full week previously. On the third day of the seventh month, the high priest moved from his house in the city into the temple, and he was twice sprinkled with the ashes of the red heifer, by way of precaution against defilement. He spent the week in practicing and rehearsing, under the eye of some of the elders of the Sanhedrim, the various acts that he would have to perform on the great day, and on the night immediately preceding it he was not allowed to sleep. In case of his sudden death or disqualification, a substitute was appointed to fulfill his function.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats. It was necessary that the sacrifice offered for a person or class of persons should be provided by the offerer or offerers. The two kids of the goats, or rather the two he-goats, constituted together but one sin offering. This is important for the understanding of the sequel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And Aaron shall offer his bullock... and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. The first step is an expiatory offering to reconcile the officiating priest and the remainder of the priestly house to God. This was necessary before his offerings for the people could be accepted. It indicates the defects inherent in a priest whose nature was only that of man, which is compassed about with infirmities. The offering here commanded is not the slaying, but the solemn presentation, of the bullock to the Lord. In after times the following form of confession was used by the high priest when he laid his hand upon the bullock: - \"O Lord, I have committed iniquity; I have transgressed; I have sinned, I and my house. O Lord, I entreat thee, cover over the iniquities, the transgressions, and the sins which I have committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee, I and my house; even as it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, 'For on that day will he cover over for you, to make you clean; from all your transgressions before the Lord ye shall be cleansed\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - It must be carefully noted that. as the two goats made one sin offering (verse 5), so they are both presented before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. By this solemn presentation they became the Lord's, one as much as the other. After this, Aaron is to cast lots upon the two goats. The two goats, of the same size and appearance as far as possible, stood together near the entrance of the court. And by them was an urn containing two lots. These the high priest drew out at the same moment, placing one on the head of one goat, the other on the head of the other goat. According as the lot fell. one of the goats was taken and at once offered to the Lord, with a view to being shortly sacrificed; the other was appointed for a scapegoat, and reserved till the expiatory sacrifices had been made, when it too was offered to the Lord, and then sent away into the wilderness. After the lot had been chosen, the two goats were distinguished from each other by having a piece of scarlet cloth tied, the first round its neck, the second round its horn. One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat. The last word is in the original la-azazel, and being found only in this chapter, it has caused a great discrepancy of opinion among interpreters as to its meaning. It has been diversely regarded as a place, a person, a thing, and an abstraction. The first class of interpreters explain it as some district of the wilderness; the second understand by it an evil spirit; the third take it as a designation of the goat; the fourth translate it, \"for removal.\" The first interpretation may be summarily rejected. If a localized spot were meant, that spot would have been left behind by a people constantly on the move. The second hypothesis - that azazel was an evil spirit, or the evil spirit - has been embraced by so considerable a number of modern expositors, that it is necessary to dwell upon it at some length. But, indeed, it has little to recommend it. It has been argued that azazel must be a proper name, because it has no article prefixed to it, la-azazel. This is a grammatical error. When a noun expresses an office or a function, and has the preposition le or la prefixed to it, it does not take an article in Hebrew any more than in French; e.g., in the verse, \"Jehu... shalt thou anoint to be king (or for king) over Israel; and Elisha... shalt thou appoint to be prophet (or for prophet) in thy room\" (1 Kings 19:16), the Hebrew is le-melek and le-navi, without the article. The same idiom will be found in 1 Samuel 25:30; 2 Samuel 7:14. With greater plausibility it is argued that verse 8 contrasts Jehovah and Azazel, and that if la-Yehovah be translated \"for Jehovah,\" or \"for the Lord,\" la-azazel must be translated \"for Azazel.\" It may be allowed that there is a prima facie likelihood that, where words are thus contrasted, if one designates a person, the other would designate a person. But it is an incredibly rash assertion that this is always the case. All depends upon the idea which the speaker or writer has in his mind and desires to express. As part of the same argument, it is urged that the preposition, being the same in both clauses of the sentence, must be translated by the same word. This is certainly not the case. The natural meaning of le with a proper name is \"for,\" and with a word expressing the performance of some function (technically called nomen agentis) it means \"to be\" (see the passage quoted above from 1 Kings 19:16). Unless, therefore, azazel be a proper name (which has to be proved, not assumed)the preposition need not and ought not to be translated by \"for\" but by \"to be.\" The word le is used with great latitude, and often in a different sense in the same sentence; e.g., Exodus 12:24; Leviticus 26:12. The objections to the theory that azazel means an evil spirit are of overwhelming force. It will be enough to name the following.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The name azazel is nowhere else mentioned. This could not be, if he were so important a being as to divide with Jehovah the sin offering of the congregation of Israel on the great Day of Atonement.NEWLINENEWLINE2. No suitable etymology can be discerned. The nearest approach to it is very forced - \"the separated one.\"NEWLINENEWLINE3. The notion of appeasing, or bribing, or mocking the evil spirit by presenting to him a goat, is altogether alien from the spirit of the rest of the Mosaic institutions. Where else is there anything like it?NEWLINENEWLINE4. The goat is presented and offered to Jehovah equally with the goat which is slain. To take that which has been offered (and therefore half sacrificed) to God and give it to Satan, would be a daring impiety, which is inconceivable. That la-azazel means \"for removal\" is the opinion of Bahr, Tholuck, Winer, and others. There is nothing objectionable in this interpretation, but the form of the word azazel points rather to an agent than to an abstract act. Azazel is a word softened (according to a not unusual custom) from azalzel, just as kokav is a softened form of kay-kay, and as Babel is derived from Balbel (Genesis 11:9). Azalzel is an active participle or participial noun, derived ultimately from azal (connected with the Arabic word azala, and meaning removed), but immediately from the reduplicate form of that verb, azazal. The reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that while azal means removed, azalzal means removed by a repetition of acts. Azalzel, or azazel, therefore, means one who removes by a series of acts. \"In this sense the word azazel is strictly expressive of the function which is ascribed to the scapegoat in verses 21, 22; namely, that he be sent away, bearing upon him all the iniquities of the children of Israel into the wilderness.' It properly denotes one that removes or separates; yet a remover in such sort that the removal is not effected by a single act or at one moment, but by a series of minor acts tending to and issuing in a complete removal. No word could better express the movement of the goat before the eyes of the people, as it passed on, removing at each step, in a visible symbol, their sins further and further from them, until, by continued repetition of the movement, they were carried far away and removed utterly\" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). That it is the goat that is designated by the word azazel is the exposition of the LXX., Josephus, Symmachus, Aquila, Theodotion, the Vulgate, the Authorized English Version, and Luther's Version. The interpretation is founded on sound etymological grounds, it suits the context wherever the word occurs, it is consistent with the remaining ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords with the otherwise known religious beliefs and symbolical practices of the Israelites. The two goats were the single sin offering for the people; the one that was offered in sacrifice symbolized atonement or covering made by shedding of blood, the other symbolized the utter removal of the sins of the people, which were conveyed away and lost in the depths of the wilderness, whence there was no return. Cf. Psalm 103:12, \"As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us;\" and Micah 7:19, \"He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.\" The eighth verse should be translated as it stands in the Authorized Version, or, if we ask for still greater exactness, And Aaron shall east lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and one lot for a remover of sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - These verses might be translated as follows: - And Aaron shall bring in the goat upon which the lot for the Lord fell, and shall offer him for a sin offering. But the goat, upon which fell the lot for a remover of sins, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to send him away for a remover of sins into the wilderness. We are justified in inserting the words, \"of sins,\" after \"a remover,\" because \"the use of the word azal, from which the word rendered by 'remover' is derived, is confined in the Hebrew dialect to the single purpose or institution which is here under consideration; so that this particular word must have conveyed to the mind of a Hebrew hearer or reader this notion of a removal of sins, and none other\" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). The goat is both presented before the Lord, and subsequently (verse 20) offered to him, the priest laying his hands upon him and making a confession of the sins of the people. After he has thus become the Lord's, how could he be given up to Satan? The purpose of his being set apart is to make an atonement with him (not for him, as some commentators explain it wrongly). As atonement was made by the blood of the sacrificed goat ceremonially covering sin, so it was also made by the live goat symbolically removing sin. But the atonement in both cases has reference to God. How could an atonement be made by an offering to Satan, unless Satan, not God, was the being whose wrath was to be propitiated, and with whom reconciliation was sought?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - After having offered the bullock for his own sin offering, and presented the two goats, which constituted the sin offering of the people, and offered one of them, Aaron kills the bullock for the sin offering. A considerable interval had to elapse before he could make use of the bullock's blood for purposes of propitiation, and during this interval, occupied by his entrance into the holy of holies with the incense, the blood was held by an attendant, probably by one of his sons, and prevented from coagulating by being kept in motion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - This is the first entry of the high priest into the holy of holies. He takes with him a censer - literally, the censer, that is, the censer that he was to use on the occasion - full of burning coals of fire from off the altar; and his hands are full of sweet incense beaten small; his object being to fill the holy of holies with the smoke of the incense which may serve as at least a thin vail between himself and the Presence of the Lord, that he die not (cf. Exodus 33:20, \"Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live;\" cf. also Genesis 32:30; Deuteronomy 5:24; Judges 6:22; Judges 13:22). Here we see taught the lesson of the vision of God, as he is, being impossible to the human faculties. He must be vailed in one way or another. After passing through the outer chamber of the tabernacle, the high priest found himself in the smaller chamber where stood the ark. Immediately he threw the incense on the coals of the censer, until the holy of holies was filled with the smoke, after which, according to later practice, he offered a prayer outside the vail. The following form of prayer, breathing, however, the spirit of ages long subsequent to the tabernacle, or even the first temple, is found in the Talmud: - \"May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that neither this day nor this year any captivity come upon us. Yet if captivity befall us this day or this year, let it be to a place where the Law is cultivated. May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that want come not upon us this day or this year. But if want visit us this day or this year, let it be due to the liberality of our charitable deeds. May it please thee, O Lord, the God of our fathers, that this year may be a year of cheapness, of fullness, of intercourse and trade; a year with abundance of rain, of sunshine, and of dew; one in which thy people Israel shall not require assistance one from another. And listen not to the prayers of those who are about to set out on a journey (against rain). And as to thy people Israel, may no enemy exalt himself against them. May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that the houses of the men of Saron (exposed to floods) may not become their graves\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The second entry of the high priest into the holy of holies took place very soon after the first entry. Immediately that he had returned after lighting the incense, and perhaps offering a prayer, he took of the blood of the bullock, which he had previously killed, went back without delay, and sprinkled it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward, that is, on the front of the ark beneath the Presence enthroned upon the mercy seat, and shrouded by the smoke of the incense; and before the mercy seat, that is, on the ground in front of it, he sprinkled of the blood with his finger seven times. In after times, when the ark was gone, the high priest sprinkled upwards once and downwards seven times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The third entry was made as soon as he had killed the goat which formed a moiety of the sin offering of the congregation, when he brought his blood likewise within the vail, and did with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, sprinkling it the same number of times as before. \"By the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies is set forth that atonement could only be effected before the throne of Jehovah\" (Clark).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The two sprinklings, first with the bullock's blood, then with the goat's blood, on the front of the ark and on the ground before it, effected the symbolical atonement which was required annually even for the holy of holies because it was pitched in the midst of sinful men. There remained the outer chamber of the tabernacle and the altar of burnt sacrifice to be atoned for. Accordingly, the high priest proceeds to do so for the tabernacle of the congregation, that is, to make a similar atonement by similar means outside the vail as he had made inside it. He would therefore have made one sprinkling with the blood upon the vail, and seven sprinklings before it, after which he placed the blood upon the horns of the altar of incense, according to the command given in Exodus 30:10. In later times it became customary also to sprinkle the top of the altar of incense seven times.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - There shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation. From the first entry until the work of atonement was completed, both for the holy of holies and for the tabernacle, no one but the high priest was to be allowed within the door of the tabernacle, not only that there might be no witness of the withdrawal of the awful vail, but also that the rite of purification might not be interfered with by an impure presence. Even on the Day of Atonement the dwelling-place of God, typical of heaven, was closed to the eye and foot of man, \"the way into the holiest of all being not yet made manifest\" (Hebrews 9:8), until the Divine High Priest opened the way for his people by his own entrance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - The holy of holies and the outer chamber of the tabernacle having been reconciled, the high priest shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord - that is, the altar of burnt sacrifice in the court, standing in front of the tabernacle, not the altar of incense, as has been supposed by some - and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times. This completes the ceremony of \"making an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and making an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar\" (verse 33.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - The second part of the ceremonies of the day now commences. It was not enough that the defilement of the sanctuary should be covered, and the sins of the priests and people atoned for by the blood of the sacrifices. There remained a consciousness of sin. How was this to be taken away? To effect this, Aaron proceeds to the unique ceremony of the day by which the utter removal of sin from the reconciled people is typified. He shall bring the live goat; this should be translated offer the live goat. It is the word used above for the offering of the goat that was slain, and it is the word always used for offering sacrifices to the Lord. The first goat had been offered in the usual manner, the offerer laying his hand on his head and perhaps praying over him. Now the second goat is offered, the high priest having to lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,... putting them upon the head of the goat. The confession of sins, at first extempore, would naturally, as time progressed, become stereotyped into a liturgical form, as it is found in the Mishna: \"O Lord, they have committed iniquity; they have transgressed; they have sinned, - thy people, the house of Israel. O Lord, cover over, I entreat thee, their iniquities, their transgressions, and their sins, which they have wickedly committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee, - thy people, the house of Israel. As it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, saying, ' For on that day shall it be covered over for you, to make you clean; from all your sins before the Lord ye shall be cleansed'\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service '). During this confession of sins the people remained prostrate in humiliation and prayer in the court of the tabernacle, and it was the custom of the high priest to turn towards them as he pronounced the last words, \"Ye shall be cleansed.\" At the conclusion of the confession, the high priest handed over the goat to a fit man, that is, to a man who was standing ready to take charge of him, and sent him away by his hand into the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Then the goat went forth, bearing upon him all their iniquities. The slain goat had symbolized and ceremonially wrought full atonement or covering of sins; but in order to impress upon the mind of the nation a joyful sense of entire liberation from the burden of sin, the second symbol of the disappearing goat is used; so that not only sin, but the consciousness and the fear of the taint and presence of sin, might be taken away from the cleansed and delivered people. The goat is to bear the iniquities of the people unto a land not inhabited. The latter words - in the original, eretz gezerah - would be more correctly translated, a laud cut off, that is, completely isolated from the surrounding country by some barrier of rock or torrent, which would make it impossible for the goat to come back again. Thus the sins were utterly lost, as though they had never been, and they could not return to the sanctified people. The Hebrew word gazar, to cut (1 Kings 3:25; Psalm 136:18), is represented in Arabic by jazara, and the substantive gezerah by jaziruh, which means an island, or an area surrounded by rivers. The word is still in use in countries where Arabic is spoken, as the designation of a district divided from the neighbouring territories by rivers cutting it off, and making it a sort of island or peninsula. Into such a district as this, the man who led the goat was to let him go. In later times, contrary to the spirit of the Mosaic appointment, the goat was pushed over a projecting ledge of rock, and so killed, a device of man clumsily introduced for the purpose of perfecting a symbolism of Divine appointment. It was more in accordance with the original institution that \"the arrival of the goat in the wilderness was immediately telegraphed by the waving of flags, from station to station, till a few minutes after its occurrence it was known in the temple, and whispered from ear to ear, that the goat had borne upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). Both the goat that was sacrificed and the goat that served as remover of sins typified Christ. The first presents him to our faith as the Victim on the cross, the other as the Sin-bearer on whom the Lord laid \"the iniquity of us all\" (Isaiah 53:4; cf. 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 3:13). \"The reason for making use of two animals is to be found purely in the physical impossibility of combining all features that had to be set forth in the sin offering in one animal\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - In later times another scene was interposed at this point. The high priest, having sent away the man with the goat, recited the passages of Scripture which commanded the observance of the Day of Atonement (chapters 16; 23:27-32; Numbers 29:7-11), and offered prayers in which the people might mentally join. Then he went back into the tabernacle of the congregation (not into the holy of holies), and, as all the special atoning and purifying services of the day were now over, he there took off his linen dress, and put it away; and after bathing in the holy place, that is, in that part of the sanctuary set apart for that purpose, he put on his ordinary high-priestly garments, and sacrificed first a goat for a sin offering (Numbers 29:16), next his own burnt offering of a ram, and then the burnt offering of the people, which was also a ram and other victims (Ibid.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - After the flesh of the burnt sacrifice had been placed in order on the altar, the fat of the sin offering, that is, of the bullock (verse 6) and of the goat (verse 15) and of the other goat (Numbers 29:16), is placed upon it, and burnt upon the altar, according to the regular practice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The man that let go the goat which served for a remover of sins is to wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh before he comes into the camp. This is not ordered on account of any special defilement attaching to the scapegoat, but only because it had been the symbolical sin-bearer, and therefore conveyed legal uncleanness by its touch. The man who bore the flesh of the ether goat to be burnt had to do exactly the same thing (verse 25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - As the blood of the bullock and the goat which had been offered in the special expiatory sacrifices of the day had been carried within the sanctuary (verses 14, 15), their bodies had to be burnt without the camp (Leviticus 4:12). Our Lord being the antitype, not only of Aaron as the Great High Priest, but also of the expiatory sacrifices as the Great Sin Offering, the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that the fact of Christ's having \"suffered without the camp\" serves as an indication that his blood had in its atoning effects been carried by him into heaven, the antitype of the holy of holies (Hebrews 13:12). The flesh of the other goat, offered as a sin offering, would have been eaten by the priests in the evening, at a sacrificial meal (Leviticus 10:17, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-31. - The ceremonies of the Day of Atonement are not appointed for once only, but they are to be of annual observance. This shall be a statute for ever unto you, as long as the nation should exist, that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all. The seventh is the sacred month, in which the first, the tenth, the fifteenth, and following days are appointed as holy seasons. The Day of Atonement is the single fast of the Jewish Church occurring once a year only. On it all the members of that Church were to afflict their souls, on pain of death (Leviticus 23:29). The fast began on the evening of the ninth day, and ended on the evening of the tenth, when it was succeeded by general feasting. During the whole of the twenty-four hours no work at all was to be done. In this respect the Day of Atonement was put on a level with the sabbath, whereas on the annual festivals only \"servile work\" was forbidden (see Leviticus 23:7, 21, 25, 35). On this day, therefore, as on the weekly sabbath, it was not permitted to collect manna (Exodus 16:26), or to plough or reap (Exodus 34:21), or to light a fire (Exodus 35:3), or to gather wood (Numbers 15:32-36), or to carry corn or fruit (Nehemiah 13:15), or to sell food or other goods (Nehemiah 13:16), or to bear burdens (Jeremiah 17:22, 23), or to set out grain for sale (Amos 8:5). And these regulations applied to strangers that sojourned among them as well as to themselves. It was a sabbath of rest; literally, a sabbath of sabbatism. The purpose of the abstinence from food and labour was to bring the soul of each individual into harmony with the solemn rites of purification publicly performed not by themselves, but by the high priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - That there may be no mistake, it is specifically enjoined that not only Aaron, but the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate - meaning, the high priest that shall be anointed, and shall be consecrated - to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead - that is, to succeed from time to time to the high priesthood - shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments. Again it may be noticed that the white robes are termed, not the penitential, but the holy, garments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus16:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - This shall be an everlasting statute unto you. It lasted as long as the earthly Jerusalem lasted, and until the heavenly Jerusalem was instituted, when it had a spiritual fulfillment once for all. \"Of old there was an high priest that cleansed the people with the blood of bulls and goats, but now that the true High Priest is come, the former priesthood is no more. It is a providential dispensation of God that the city and temple of Jerusalem have been destroyed; for if they were still standing, some who are weak in faith might be dazzled by the outward splendor of the literal types, and not drawn by faith to the spiritual antitypes. If there are any, therefore, who, in considering the Levitical ritual of the great Day of Atonement, and in looking at the two he-goats - the one sacrificed, the other let go, charged with sins, into the wilderness - do not recognize the one Christ who died for our sins and took away our sins, and do not see there the 'everlasting statute' of which God here speaks by Moses, let him go up thrice a year to Jerusalem, and there search for the altar which has crumbled in the dust, and offer up his victims there without a priest. But no; thanks be to God, the earthly priesthood and temple are abolished, that we may raise our heart to the heavenly, and look up with faith and love and joy to him who offered himself once for all, and who ever liveth to make intercession for us\" (Origen, 'Hom.' 10, as quoted by Wordsworth). And he did as the Lord commanded Moses; that is. Moses announced to Aaron the Law which was to be carried out about five months later.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEThis chapter finds its natural place here as the supplement of all that has gone before. The first part of the book contains the institution or regulation of the sacrificial system (chapters 1-7). This chapter, therefore, which gives injunctions as to the place where all sacrifices are to be offered, might well, as Knobel has remarked, have taken its place as chapter 8. The second part contains the institution of the hereditary priesthood (chapters 8-10). This chapter, therefore, which forbids for the future all offering of sacrifices in the open fields, and commands that they shall be brought \"unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,\" would still more fitly find its place after chapter 10. But the first two sections of the third part (chapters 11-16) contain the laws and rules respecting cleansing from ceremonial defilement, and this cleansing is to be mainly effected by the means of sacrifice. Therefore the rule as to the place where sacrifice shall be offered is most naturally given here, where it is found (chapter 17), forming a close not only to Parts I and II, but also to the two sections of Part III, which contain the regulations as to purification by sacrifice. It is altogether a mistake to make a Second Book begin with chapter 17, as is clone by Lange and Keil. The first injunction contained in the chapter (verses 2-7) is very generally understood to mean that while the Israelites lived in the wilderness, all animals fit for sacrifices which were slain for food should be so far regarded as sacrifices that they should be brought to the door of the tabernacle and slain in the court, an offering of the blood and fat being made to the Lord. Thus the ordinary slaughtering of domestic animals, it is said, became sanctified, and the dignity of life made clear: God is the Lord of life; he gave it, and it must not be taken away unless the blood, which is the vehicle of life, be offered to him by being presented sacrificially on his altar, or, where this is not possible, as in the case of wild animals, by being reverently covered with earth. Such a rule as this respecting the slaughtering of domestic animals, difficult to carry out in any case, would become impossible to obey after the camp had been expanded into a nation, and it is therefore supposed that it is by anticipation repealed in Deuteronomy 12:15 (\"Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee\"), while the regulations as to restricting the offering of sacrifice to the court of the temple, and as to pouring blood on the earth, are there emphatically enforced. This view of the text is erroneous, and must be rejected. The injunction dues not refer to the ordinary slaughter of domestic animals for food, but only to sacrifices. Hitherto it had been the right and the duty of the head of each family to offer sacrifice for his household, and this he did wherever he thought proper, according to the ancient patriarchal practice, and most naturally in the open fields. This duty and liberty is now abolished. The Aaronic priesthood has superseded the older priestly system, and henceforth every sacrifice is to be offered in the court of the tabernacle, and by the hand of Aaron's sons. The change was most momentous, but it could not but be made after the consecration of Aaron and his sons for an hereditary priesthood. A second reason for the change being made was the immediate danger to which a rude and superstitious people was exposed, of offering the parts which they were bound to set aside for the altar of God to some other deity, if God's priests and altar were not at hand. The imaginations of the Israelites, corrupted by their stay in Egypt, peopled the fields with beings answering to the Pan and the satyrs of the Greeks; and to these the sacred portions of the animals slaughtered elsewhere than at the tabernacle were offered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat. The use of the word killeth, instead of sacrificeth, is one of the chief causes of the error referred to above, which represents this command as applying to the slaughter of domestic animals. But it is always permissible to use a generic in place of a specific term, and its use proves nothing. Probably the sacred writer uses it as a less sacred term, and therefore more suitable to sacrifices offered to the spirits of the fields and woods. If ordinary slaughtering were meant, there is no reason why pigeons and turtle-doves should not be added to the ox, or lamb, or goat. That every ox, or lamb, or goat, to be killed in the camp, or... out of the camp, for the food of more than 600,000 men, should be brought to so confined a space as the court of the tabernacle for slaughter, where the animals for the daily, weekly, annual, and innumerable private sacrifices were also killed, appears almost credible in itself. How would the drivers have made their way into it? and what would have soon been the state of the court? It is true that animal food was not the staple sustenance of the Israelites in the wilderness; but not unfrequently, after a successful war or raid, there must have been a vast number of cattle killed for feasting or reserved for subsequent eating.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In case a man offers a sacrifice elsewhere than at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,... blood shall be imputed unto that man; that is, it shall no longer be regarded as a sacrifice at all, but an unjustifiable shedding of blood, for which he is to be cut off from among his people, that is, excommunicated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices. This passage tells us the purpose of the previous command: it is to prevent sacrifices being sacrificed (the word is twice used in the original) in the open field, or anywhere else than in the court of the tabernacle. It follows that the command refers to sacrifice, not to mere slaughtering. Clark, taking the opposite view of the command, is obliged to change the translation, sacrifices which they offer in the open field, into \"beasts for slaughter which they now slaughter in the open field\" ('Speaker's Commentary'); but he has no authority for doing so. Zabach means always, in the Pentateuch, to slay in sacrifice. These field sacrifices, when offered to the Lord in the proper place and with the proper ceremonies, would become peace offerings unto the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The priest, that is, the Levitical priest, is henceforth to sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord... and burn the fat for a sweet savour, which were the two parts of the sacrifice which were essentially priestly in their character. The old priestly function of the head of the family is disallowed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. The word rightly translated devils means, literally, shaggy goats (see 2 Chronicles 11:15; Isaiah 13:21; Isaiah 34:14; where the word occurs). It is generally supposed that the Israelites borrowed their worship of the goat-like spirits of the woods and fields from Egypt. That goat-worship prevailed there in a very foul shape we know (Herod., 2:42), but sacrifices in the open fields are rather a Persian habit (Herod., 1:132). Pan-worship, however, was common to most if not to all agricultural nations. The injunction which follows, This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations, which cannot be confined to the last few words or verses, shows that the command of verse 3 refers to sacrifices, not to ordinary slaughtering. Had slaughtering been meant, the statute could not have been intended to be more than temporary in its obligation. The importance attributed to the regulation is further shown by the declaration previously made, that whoever transgressed it should be cut off from among his people, or excommunicated. In fact, it makes an era in the history of the chosen people. The old patriarchal priesthood having ceased, and the Aaronic priesthood substituted for it, the tabernacle is appointed to serve as a religious centre to the race. Whenever, from this time onwards, sacrifices were offered, without offense, elsewhere than in the court of the tabernacle or temple, as by Samuel (see 1 Samuel 13:8), and by Elijah (1 Kings 18:32), it was done by the direct order or dispensation of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - So essential is the regulation to the maintenance of the Israelitish polity, that it is extended to the strangers which sojourn among them, not confined to those who were of the house of Israel; and the penalty of excommunication is appointed for both classes alike in case of disobedience. It may be noticed that this verse assumes that burnt offerings and peace offerings are offered by the strangers that sojourn among them, as well as by the Israelites by race.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - The appointment made just above, that the blood of all animals slain in sacrifice should be offered to the Lord on his altar in the court of the tabernacle, leads naturally to a reiteration of the prohibition of the eating of blood, and a statement of the reason of that prohibition. \"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat,\" was given as a command to Noah (Genesis 9:4). It has already been repeated twice in the Book of Leviticus (Leviticus 3:17; Leviticus 7:26), and it is still again found in chapter Leviticus 19:26; Deuteronomy 12:16; Deuteronomy 15:23. The present is the locus classicus which explains the earnestness with which the rule is enforced. It begins with an extension of the obligation from the Israelites to the sojourners among them, and with a solemn declaration that, in case of transgression, God will take into his own bands the punishment of the offenders; not only is he to be cut off or excommunicated by political or ecclesiastical authority, but God himself will set his face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people, by death, or such means as he chooses to adopt. Then follows the reason for the prohibition. For the life of the flesh is in the blood. The blood may not be eaten because it is the vehicle of life, literally, the soul of the flesh, that is, it is the seat of the animal life of the body. \"It is the fountain of life,\" says Harvey; \"the first to live, the last to die, and the primary seat of the animal soul; it lives and is nourished of itself, and by no other part of the human body.\" In consequence of possessing this character, it is to be reserved, to make an atonement for your souls upon the altar; for thus only blood became qualified for the purpose of atonement. The clause, for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul, should be translated, for the blood maketh atonement by means of the soul, i.e., by means of the life which it contains. It is because the blood is the vehicle of the animal's life, and represents that life, that it serves to cover, or make atonement for, the soul of the offerer of the sacrifice, who presents it instead of his own life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - This verse emphatically restates that the atoning power of the blood, as being the seat of life, is the reason that the eating of it is forbidden, and the same statement is repeated in a different connexion in verse 14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - Negatively, it has been ordered that blood shall not be eaten; positively, that it is to be offered to God. But there may be cases where the latter command cannot be caused out, as when animals are killed in hunting. On such occasions the man who kills the animal, whether he be an Israelite or a sojourner, is to pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust, regarding it as a sacred thing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - There is still another possible case. The blood of an animal may not have been shed, or not shed in such a way as to make it flow abundantly, as when the animal has died a natural death, or been killed by wild beasts. In this case, as the blood still remains in the body, the flesh may not be eaten without defilement. The defilement may be cleansed by the unclean man washing his clothes and bathing, but if he neglect to do this, he shall bear his iniquity, that is, undergo the consequence of his transgression, which he would not have undergone had he been ceremonially cleansed (cf. Exodus 22:30; chapter Leviticus 11:39; Deuteronomy 14:21). The prohibition of the eating of blood was continued by the Council of Jerusalem, but the observance of the regulation was no longer commanded as a duty binding on all men, but as a concession to Jewish feelings, enabling Jewish and Gentile converts to live together in comfort (see 1 Samuel 14:32; Ezekiel 33:35; Acts 15:20).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINESECTION III.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 18. MORAL UNCLEANNESS AND ITS PUNISHMENT. This being the subject of the three following chapters (chapters 18-20), they naturally form a sequence to chapters 11-17, which have dealt with ceremonial uncleanness and its purification. It is a remarkable thing that, except by implication in connection with the sin offerings and the trespass offerings and the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, there has not yet been a single moral precept, as such, in the Book of Leviticus, and there has been very little recognition of sin as distinct from pollution. All has been ceremonial. But the ceremonial is typical of the moral, and from the consideration of ceremonial uncleanness and its remedy, we now proceed to the consideration of moral uncleanness and its penalty. It is to be noticed too that, while the ensuing laws are commanded as the positive injunction of God (verses 2, 30), which of itself is sufficient to give them their authority and force, they are still founded, like the ceremonial prohibitions, upon the feelings of repugnance implanted in the mind of man. To enter into the marriage relation with near relatives is abhorrent to a sentiment in mankind so widely spread that it may be deemed to have been originally universal, and the same abhorrence is entertained towards other foul sins of lust. Ugliness, which creates disgust by its ugliness, symbolizes sin; immorality, which inspires abhorrence by its immoral character, proves itself thereby to be sin. The section deals first with sin in the marriage relation, next with sexual impurities connected with marriage, then with other cases of immorality, and lastly with the penalties inflicted on these sins in their character of crimes. Verses 1-5 form an introduction to the Hebrew code of prohibited degrees of marriage and of forbidden sins of lust. The formal and solemn declaration, I am the Lord your God, is made three times in these five verses. This places before the people the two thoughts:NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the Lord is holy, and they ought to be like him in holiness;NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the Lord has commanded holiness, and they ought to obey him by being holy. Because the Lord is their God, and they are his people, they are, negatively, to refrain from the vicious habits and lax customs prevalent in the land of Egypt wherein they dwelt, and in the land of Canaan whither they were going, the sensuality of which is indirectly condemned by the injunctions which command purity in contrast to their doings; and, positively, they are to keep God's statutes, and his judgments, as laid down in the following code, which if a man do, he shall live in them. The latter clause is of special importance, because it is repeated in the same connection by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 20:11, 13, 21), and in the Levitical confession in the Book of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 9:29), and is quoted by St. Paul in a controversial sense (Romans 10:5; Galatians 3:12). Its full meaning is that by obedience to God's commands man attains to a state of existence which alone deserves to be called true life - \"the life which connects him with Jehovah through his obedience\" (Clark). And this involves the further truth that disobedience results in death. Accordingly, St. Paul uses the text as being the testimony of the Law with regard to itself, that salvation by it is of works in contrast with faith. (Cf. Luke 10:28.) We have no evidence to tell us what were the doings of the land of Canaan in respect to the marriage relation, but this chapter is enough to show that the utmost laxity prevailed in it, and we may be sure that their religious rites, like those of Midian (Numbers 25), were penetrated with the spirit of licentiousness. With regard to the doings of the land of Egypt, we have fuller information. We know that among the Egyptians marriage with sisters and half-sisters was not only permissible, but that its propriety was justified by their religious beliefs, and practiced in the royal family (Died. Sic., 1:27; Die. Cass., 42). Other abominations condemned in this chapter (verse 23) also, as we know, existed there (Herod., 2:46), and if queens could be what in later times Cleopatra was, we may imagine the general dissoluteness of the people. Among Persians, Medes, Indians, Ethiopians and Assyrians, marriage with mothers and daughters was allowed, and from the time of Cambyses, marriage with a sister was regarded as lawful (Herod., 3:31). The Athenians and Spartans permitted marriage with half-sisters. All these concessions to lust, and ether unclean acts with which the heathen world was full (verse 22; Romans 1:27), were fallings away from the law of purity implanted in the heart of man and now renewed for the Hebrew people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The next thirteen verses contain the law of incest, or the prohibited degrees of marriage. The positive law of marriage, as implanted in the human heart, would be simply that any man of full age might marry any woman of full age, provided that both parties were willing. But this liberty is at once controlled by a number of restrictions, the main purpose of which is to prevent incest, which, however much one nation may come to be indifferent to one form of it, and another to another, is yet abhorrent to the feelings and principles of mankind. The Hebrew restrictive law is contained in one verse. None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord. All that follows (verses 9-18) is simply an amplification and an explanation of the words, near of kin to him. These words would be literally rendered, flesh of his flesh, or less probably (as in the margin), remainder of his flesh. They certainly include within the compass of their meaning those that are near by affinity, as much as those that are near by consanguinity. This is proved by the instances given below, where no difference is drawn between blood relations and relations by marriage, the latter being supposed to become the former, in consequence of the marriage that has taken place. Nearness of kin is generally counted by \"degrees;\" but, unfortunately, this word is itself ambiguous, for it is used in different senses by canonists and by civilians. So far as the direct line is concerned, the same method of calculation is observed by the canon and by the civil law. There is one degree from the son to the mother, two degrees to the grandmother; one degree from the father to the daughter, two degrees to the granddaughter. But this is not so with the collateral lines. A brother and sister, for example, are regarded by the canon law as in the first degree of kinship, because there is only one step to the father, in whom their blood meets; but the civil lawyers consider them as being in the second degree, because, as they calculate, there is one step from the brother to the father, and a second from the father to the sister. An aunt is, according to the canonists, in the second degree of propinquity, because there are two steps from her nephew to his grandfather, who is likewise her father, in whom their blood unites; but, according to the civilian's calculation, there are three steps, namely, from her nephew to his grandfather, two steps, and a third from that grandfather to his daughter the aunt; and therefore the aunt and nephew are in the third degree of propinquity. The case of an uncle and niece is exactly the same as that of a nephew and aunt. On the same principle, according to the canonists, first cousins are in the second degree of kinship; according to the civilians, in the fourth. Propinquity by affinity is calculated in just the same way; so that the brother's wife is in the same degree of relationship as the brother, and wife's sister as the sister by blood. In the code before us, confirmed by that in Deuteronomy, marriage is forbidden with the following blood relations: mother (verse 7), daughter (verse 17), sister (verse 9; Leviticus 20:17; Deuteronomy 27:22), granddaughter (verse 10), aunt (verses 12, 13; Leviticus 20:19); and with the following relations by affinity: mother-in-law (verse 17; chapter Leviticus 20:14; Deuteronomy 27:23), daughter-in-law (verse 15; Leviticus 20:12), brother's wife (verse 16; Leviticus 20:21), stepmother (verse 8; chapter 20:11; Deuteronomy 22:30; see Genesis 49:4; 1 Corinthians 5:1), stepdaughter and step-granddaughter (verse 17), uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage (verse 14; Leviticus 20:20); putting aside for the present the question of who is meant by a wife to her sister, in verse 18. In these lists, according to the canonists' method of reckoning, the mother, the daughter, and the sister are related in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, the brother's wife, are related in the first degree of affinity. The granddaughter and the aunt are in the second degree of consanguinity; the wife's granddaughter and the uncle's wife in the second degree of affinity. According to the civilians' reckoning, the following would be the degrees of propinquity: - The mother and the daughter would be in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, would be in the first degree of affinity. The sister and the granddaughter would be in the second degree of consanguinity; the brother's wife and the wife's granddaughter would be in the second degree of affinity. The aunt by blood would be in the third degree of consanguinity, and the uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage, would be in the third degree of affinity. The wife's sister, with regard to whom it is questioned whether she is referred to or not in verse 18, is in the first degree of affinity (a man's wife being regarded as himself) according to the canonists' reckoning, and in the second according to the civilians'. There is no mention made in the code of the grandmother, the niece, and the cousin-german. All of these are in the second degree of consanguinity according to the canon law; and according to the civil law, the grandmother would be in the second degree, the niece in the third, and the cousin-german in the fourth. It may reasonably be supposed that by the expression, None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness, intercourse is forbidden between all those who are related by consanguinity or affinity in the first and second degrees according to the canonists' reckoning (except cousins-german, whose case is considered below); in the first, second, and third degrees 'according to the civilians' method of calculating; whether they are mentioned by name in the list or not. It is only by implication, not by direct injunction, that marriage even with a daughter is forbidden (verse 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - Incest with a stepmother is placed next after that with a mother. On account of the unity caused by marriage (\"they shall be one flesh,\" Genesis 2:24), the stepmother's nakedness is the father's nakedness. The tie of affinity is thus declared to be similar in its effects to the tie of consanguinity. Reuben's sin, by which he forfeited his birthright, is connected with this offense, but is of a more heinous character, as his father was alive at the time of his transgression (Genesis 49:4). It is one of the sins which Ezekiel enumerates as those which brought the judgment of God on Israel (Ezekiel 22:10). \"That one should have his father's wife\" is declared by St. Paul to be \"such fornication as is not named among the Gentiles,\" and to call for the excommunication of the offender (1 Corinthians 5:1-5). Adonijah's marriage with Abishag, so strongly resented by Solomon on political grounds, is not denounced as morally reprehensible, probably because Abishag was not the wife of David in such a way as to cause the marriage with his son to be abominable in the eye of the law (cf. 1 Kings 1:4 with Amos 2:7). Absalom's\" going in unto his father's concubines\" was regarded as the final act which made reconciliation with his father impossible (2 Samuel 16:22; 2 Samuel 20:3). The history of the Church has shown that marriage with the stepmother has had to be again and again prohibited by Council after Council (see Smith and Cheetham's 'Dictionary of Antiquities,' s.v. 'Prohibited Degrees').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In the third place, incest with a sister is forbidden, and it is specifically stated that under the term \"sister\" is meant the half-sister, the daughter of thy father, or... thy mother,... born at home, as would naturally be the case if she were the father's daughter, or born abroad, that is, the daughter of the mother by a previous marriage, when she belonged to a different household. Tamar's appeal to Amnon, \"I pray thee speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee,\" exhibits to us the poor woman grasping at any argument which might save her from her half-brother's brutality, and does not indicate that such marriages were, in the time of David, permissible (2 Samuel 13:29). The exact degree of relationship which existed between Abraham and Sarah is not altogether certain (cf. Genesis 20:12 with Genesis 11:29). Ezekiel reckons this sin in the catalogue of the iniquities of Jerusalem (Ezekiel 22:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The fourth case of incest which is prohibited is that with a granddaughter, whether the daughter of son or daughter, for, as they are descended from the grandfather, their's is thine own nakedness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Incest with a half-sister on the father's side is again forbidden.

Yet this is commanded under certain circumstances in the Book of Deuteronomy, and was practiced in patriarchal times (Genesis 38:8). The following are the circumstances under which it is commanded. \"If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her\" (Deuteronomy 25:5). It has been asked, \"How can the same thing be forbidden as immoral in Leviticus, and commanded as a duly in Deuteronomy?\" Bishop Wordsworth replies, \"In a special case, for a special reason applicable only to the Jews, God was pleased to dispense with that law, and in the plenitude of his omnipotence to change the prohibition into a command.... God cannot command anything that is sinful. For sin is 'transgression of the Law' (1 John 3:4), and whatever he commands is right. But it would be presumptuous to say that we may dispense with God's law concerning marriage, because he in one case dispensed with it; as it would be impious to affirm that murder is not immoral, and may be committed by us, bemuse God, who is the sole Arbiter of life and death, commanded Abraham to slay his son Isaac.\" The levirate marriage was not a concession to the desires of the second brother, but a duty enjoined for a family or tribal purpose, and it was plainly at all times must distasteful. Thus Onan refused to perform his duty to Er's wife (Genesis 38:9); the legislation in Deuteronomy anticipates objection on the part of the brother, and institutes an in-suiting ceremony to be gone through by him if he declines to do his duty to his dead brother (Deuteronomy 25:9, 10), which we see carried out in some of its details in the case of Ruth's kinsman (Ruth 4:7, 10). Indeed, in such a marriage, the second husband seems rather to have been regarded as the continuation of the first husband than as having a substantive existence of his own as a married man. He performed a function in order \"that the name of his brother which is dead may not be put out of Israel\" (Deuteronomy 25:6), \"to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren\" (Ruth 3:10). The second husband's position may be compared to that of the concubine presented by Rachel to her husband. \"Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her\" (Genesis 30:3). The whole object of the rule was that, as the elder brother could not keep up the flintily by begetting an heir, the younger brother should do it for him after his death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The ninth form of incest prohibited is intercourse with a stepdaughter, or step-granddaughter, or mother-in-law. The expression made use of, Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, covers the case of a man's own daughter, and it is singular that it is only in this incidental manner that it is specifically named. But it has been already disposed of by the general command, None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness. The daughter being nearest of kin, this command was sufficient without further specification. The niece and probably the wife's sister are forbidden by the same general rule (see following note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time. Do these words refer to the marriage of two sisters or not? It has been passionately affirmed that they do, by those who are opposed to permission being granted for marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and by those who are in favour of that measure, each party striving to derive from the text an argument for the side which they are maintaining. But Holy Scripture ought not to be made a quarry whence partisans hew arguments for views which they have already adopted, nor is that the light in which a commentator can allow himself to regard it. A reverent and profound study of the passage before us, with its context, leads to the conclusion that the words have no bearing at all on the question of marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and thus it may be removed from the area and atmosphere of angry polemics. It is certain that the words translated a wife to her sister may be translated, in accordance with the marginal rendering, one wife to another. The objections made to such a version are arbitrary and unconvincing. It is in accordance with the genius of the Hebrew language to take \"father,\" \"son, brother,\" \"sister,\" in a much wider acceptation than is the case in the Western tongues. Anything that produces or causes is metaphorically a \"father;\" anything produced or caused is a \"son;\" any things akin to each other in form, shape, character, or nature, are \"brothers\" and \"sisters.\" This is the name given to the loops of the curtains of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:3, 5, 6), the tenons of the boards (Exodus 26:17), and the wings of the cherubim (Ezekiel 1:11, 23). Indeed, wherever the expression, \"a man to his brother,\" or \"a woman to her sister,\" is used (and it is used very frequently) in the Hebrew Scriptures, it means not two brothers or two sisters, but two things or persons similar in kind. This does more than raise a presumption - it creates a high probability - that the expression should be understood in the same way here. But a difficulty then arises. If the right reading is, Neither shalt thou take one wife to another, does not the verse forbid polygamy altogether, and is not polygamy permitted by Exodus 21:7-11; Deuteronomy 21:15-17; Deuteronomy 17:17? Certainly, if so important a restriction was to be made, we should expect it to be made directly, and in a manner which could not be disputed. Is there any way out of the difficulty? Let us examine each word of the Law. Neither shalt thou take one wife to another, to vex, to uncover her nakedness upon her in her life time. The two words, to vex, have not been sufficiently dwelt on. The Hebrew, tsarar, means to distress by packing closely together, and so, to vex, or to annoy in any way. Here is to be found the ground of the prohibition contained in the law before us. A man is not to take for a second wife a woman who is likely, from spiteful temper or for other reasons, to vex the first wife. Rachel vexed Leah; Peninnah vexed Hannah; the first pair were blood relations, the second were not; but under the present law the second marriage would in both cases have been equally forbidden, if the probability of the provocation had been foreseen. It follows that polygamy is not prohibited by the text before us, but that the liberty of the polygamist is somewhat circumscribed by the application of the law of charity. It follows, too, that the law has no bearing on the question of marriage with a deceased wife's sister, which is neither forbidden nor allowed by it. Are we then to conclude that the Law of Moses leaves the case of the wife's sister untouched? Not so, for the general principle has been laid down, None of you shall approach to any, that is near of kin to him, to uncover his nakedness, and, as we have seen, the expression, near of kin, includes relations by affinity equally with blood relations; as therefore the wife's sister is in the canonists' first degree of affinity (and in the second according to the civilians), it is reasonably inferred that marriage with her is forbidden under the above law, and this inference is confirmed by marriage with the other sister-in-law - the brother's wife - being, as the rule, prohibited. It can hardly be doubted that marriage with the grandmother and with the niece - both in the second degree of consanguinity according to the canonists, and the third degree according to the civilians - and incest with a daughter are forbidden under the same clause. The present verse completes the Levitical code of prohibited degrees. The Roman code of restrictions on marriage was almost identical with the Mosaic tables. It only differed from them by specifically naming the grandmother and the niece among the blood relations with whom a marriage might not be contracted, and omitting the brother's wife among relatives by affinity. In the time of Claudius, a change was introduced into it, for the purpose of gratifying the emperor's passion for Agrippina, which legalized marriage with a brother's daughter. This legalization con-tinned in force until the time of Constantius, who made marriage with a niece a capital crime. The imperial code and the canon law were framed upon the Mosaic and the Roman tables, and under them no question arose, except as to the marriage of the niece, the decreased wife's sister, and the first cousin. Marriage with the niece was forbidden by Constantius, as we have said, in the year 355, on penalty of capital punishment for committing the offense, and marriage with a deceased wife's sister was declared by the same emperor to be null. The canons of Councils and the declarations of the chief Church teachers are in full accordance with the imperial legislation, condemning these marriages without a dissentient voice. The only ease in which no consensus is found is that of the marriage of first cousins. By the earliest Roman law these marriages had been disallowed (Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 12:6), but in the second century B.C. they had become common (Livy, 42:34), and they continued to be lawful till the year A.D. or 385, when Theodosius condemned them, and made them punishable by the severest penalties possible. This enactment lasted only twenty years, when it was repealed by Arcadius, A.D. 404 or 405. No adverse judgment respecting the marriage of first cousins was pronounced by the Church until after the legislation of Theodosius, but it appears that that legislation was promoted at her instance, and from that time forward the tendency to condemn these marriages became more and more pronounced. See the canons of the Councils of Agde, Epaone, Auvergne, Orleans, Tours, Auxerre, in the sixth century, and of the Council in Trullo in the seventh century. The reformers of the sixteenth century in England, entrenching themselves, as usual, behind the letter of Scripture and the practice of the primitive Church, forbade marriages of consanguinity and affinity in the first, second, and third degrees according to the reckoning of the civil law, and in the first and second degrees according to the reckoning of the canon law, excepting those of first cousins, on which the early Christians pronounced no decisive judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The marriage restrictions having been laid down, there follows in the five next verses the prohibition of five sexual impurities unconnected with marriage except by their subject-matter. The first is to approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness, that is, either for seven days at the time of her ordinary illnesses (Leviticus 15:19), or any longer time that her illness might last (Leviticus 15:25), or for forty days after the birth of a man child (chapter 12:2-4), or for eighty days after the birth of a girl (Leviticus 12:5). The penalty for the offense within the seven days is death if committed willfully (Leviticus 20:18); if fallen into unknowingly, a ceremonial penalty of seven days' uncleanness is incurred (Leviticus 15:24). It is twice referred to by Ezekiel as a gross sin (Ezekiel 18:6; Ezekiel 22:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The second prohibition is, Thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife - a prohibition already made in other words in the ten commandments. The punishment for adultery is death by stoning (chapter 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22; John 9:5) - a more severe penalty than was usually inflicted in other nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The third prohibition is, Thou shall not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech. The words the fire are properly inserted, though not expressed in the original (cf. Deuteronomy 18:10; 2 Kings 22:10). What was the nature and purpose of the idolatrous rite in question is, however, uncertain. It is generally assumed that reference is made to the practice of offering children in sacrifice to Molech, Deuteronomy 12:31, Ezekiel 16:20, and Psalm 106:37 being quoted in support of that view. But it is by no means certain that this was the case. It might have been a rite by which children were dedicated to Molech - a baptism by fire, not resulting in the death of the child. Its mention here, in close connection with carnal sins, has led some to regard it as an impure rite; but this is a mistaken inference, for the prohibition of adultery naturally suggests the prohibition of a spiritual unfaithfulness. That it was some kind of idolatrous ceremony is shown by the addition of the words, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God. But if the children were burnt to death in honour of the idol, from the beginning, we should expect to find a notice of the fact in less ambiguous language than the expression, pass through the fire, conveys, earlier than the days of Ahaz. It is easy to imagine that what began as a dedication ceremony may have become converted into an absolute sacrifice, retaining still its original designation. Molech was a Canaanitish and Phoenician deity, the name meaning King, just as Baal means Lord (see Selden, 'De Diis Syris,' 1:6). Jarchi, quoted by Wordsworth, describes the idol as \"made of brass, having the face of an ox, with arms stretched out, in which the child was placed and burnt with fire, while the priests were beating drums, in order to drown the noise of its shrieks, lest the fathers might be moved with pity thereby.\" The place where the children were offered, in the later period of the Jewish history, was the valley of Hinnom (Jeremiah 7:31; Jeremiah 32:35; 2 Kings 23:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The fourth prohibition forbids the sin of Sodom (see Genesis 19:5; Judges 11:22; Romans 1:27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:10).

The reason why the Canaanites were east out before the Israelites was that they were defiled in all these things,... and the land was defiled by them. God visited the iniquity of these debased races, and the land itself vomited out her inhabitants on account of their abominations. The fate of the Canaanites was therefore a witness to them of what would be their fate if they did like them. Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things.... Ye shall not commit any of these abominations,... that the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it. Special penalties are appointed for particular sins further on. Here there are but two punishments denounced, one for individual sinners, the other national. The individual sinner is to be cut off from the nation by excommunication, For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. The nation, if it does not thus purify itself by cutting off from itself the authors of these corruptions, is to perish like the Canaanites. The words vomiteth (verse 25) and spued out (verse 28) are in that tense of the Hebrew verb which is generally called by grammarians a preterite, but this tense does not necessarily imply a past time; the time referred to depends on the context. The previous verbs, \"I cast out,\" \"I do visit,\" being present in sense, the two verbs, \"vomiteth out (her inhabitants),\" and \"spued out (the nations that were before you),\" are present also (see Introduction).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEFrom the prohibition of moral uncleanness exhibiting itself in the form of incest and licentiousness, the legislator proceeds to a series of laws and commandments against other kinds of immorality, inculcating piety, righteousness, and kindness. Chapter 19 may be regarded as an extension of the previous chapter in this direction, after which the subject of chapter 18, is again taken up in chapter 20. The precepts now given are not arranged systematically, though, as Keil has remarked, \"while grouped together rather according to a loose association of ideas than according to any logical arrangement, they are all linked together by the common purpose expressed in the words, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.' \" They begin by inculcating (in verses 3, 4) duties which fall under the heads ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the fifth commandment of the Decalogue,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the fourth,NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the first,NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the second.NEWLINENEWLINEThese four laws are, in their positive aspects,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the religious law of social order, on which a commonwealth rests;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the law of positive obedience to God's command because it is his command;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the law of piety towards the invisible Lord;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the law of faith, which trusts him without requiring risible emblems or pictures of him. In verses 11, 14, 16, 35, 36, obedience is inculcated to the eighth and the ninth commandments, which are the laws of honesty and of truthfulness; in verse 12 to the third commandment, which is the law of reverence; in verses 17, 18, 33, 34, to the sixth commandment, which is the law of love; in verses 20, 29, to the seventh commandment, which is the law of purity; in verses 9, 10, 13, the spirit of covetousness is prohibited, as forbidden in the tenth commandment, which is the law of charity. Thus this chapter may in a way be regarded as the Old Testament counterpart of the Sermon on the Mount, inasmuch as it lays down the laws of conduct, as the latter lays down the principles of action, in as comprehensive though not in so systematic a manner as the ten commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.

So in the new dispensation, \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect\" (Matthew 5:48). \"As he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation\" (1 Peter 1:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father. The words fear and reverence are in this connection interchangeable. So Ephesians 5:33, \"Let the wife see that she reverence her husband,\" where the word \"reverence\" would be more exactly translated by \"fear.\" St. Paul points out that the importance of the fifth commandment is indicated in the Decalogue by its being\" the first commandment with promise,\" that is, with a promise attached to it (Ephesians 6:2). The family life is built upon reverence to parents, and on the family is built society. Obedience to parents is a duty flowing out of one of the first two laws instituted by God - the law of marriage (Genesis 2:24). The second law instituted at the same time was that of the sabbath (Genesis 2:3), and in the verse before us observance of the sabbatical law is likewise inculcated, in the words that immediately follow - ye shall keep my sabbaths.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Turn ye not unto idols. The word used for idols, elilim, meaning nothings, is contrasted with Elohim, God. Psalm 115 exhibits this contrast in several of its particulars. Cf. St. Paul's statement, \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one\" (1 Corinthians 8:4). \"If the heart of man becomes benumbed to the use of images of false gods of any kind, he sinks down to the idols which are his ideals, and becomes as dumb and unspiritual as they are\" (Lunge). The remainder of the verse forbids the transgression of the second commandment, as the earlier part of the verse forbids the transgression of the first commandment: nor make to yourselves molten gods, as was done by Jeroboam when he set up the calves (1 Kings 12:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-8. - The unsystematic character of this chapter is indicated by prohibitions under the fifth, fourth, first, and second commandments (verses 3, 4) being succeeded by a ceremonial instruction respecting the peace offerings, repeated from Leviticus 7:16-18. The words, ye shall offer it at your own will, should rather be, for your acceptance, as in chapter Leviticus 1:3. In the seventh chapter a distinction is drawn between the peace offerings that are thank offerings, which must be eaten on the first day, and the peace offerings which are vow or voluntary offerings, which may be eaten on the first or second day. In the present resume this distinction is not noticed. Whoever transgresses this ceremonial command is to bear his iniquity and to be cut off from among his people, that is, to be excommunicated without any appointed form of reconciliation by means of sacrifice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - The injunction contained in these verses, to not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither... gather the gleanings of thy harvest, is twice afterwards repeated (Leviticus 23:22; Deuteronomy 24:19-22). In Deuteronomy, the oliveyard is specified together with the harvest-field and the vineyard, and it is added that, if a sheaf be by chance left behind, it is to remain for the benefit of the poor. The object of this law is to inculcate a general spirit of mercy, which is willing to give up its own exact rights in kindness to others suffering from want. The word here used for vineyard covers also the oliveyard. The expression, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard, would be more literally rendered, neither shalt thou gather the scattering of thy vineyard, meaning the berries (grapes or olives)which had fallen or which were left singly on the boughs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Stealing, cheating, and lying are classed together as kindred sins (see chapter Leviticus 6:2, where an example is given of theft performed by means of lying; cf. Ephesians 4:25; Colossians 3:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And ye shall not swear by my name falsely. These words contain a positive permission to swear, or take a solemn oath, by the Name of God, and a prohibition to swear falsely by it (see Matthew 5:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Cheating and stealing are again forbidden, and, together with these, other forms of oppression although legal. The command to pay labourers their hire promptly - which covers also the case of paying tradesmen promptly - is repeated in Deuteronomy 24:14 (cf. James 5:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou shalt not curse the deaf. The sin of cursing another is in itself complete, whether the curse be heard by that other or not, because it is the outcome of sin in the speaker's heart. The suffering caused to one who hears the curse creates a further sin by adding an injury to the person addressed. Strangely in contrast with this is not only the practice of irreligious men, who care little how they curse a man in his absence, but the teaching which is regarded by a large body of Christians as incontrovertible. \"No harm is done to reverence but by an open manifestation of insult. How, then, can a son sin gravely when he curses his father without the latter's knowing it, or mocks at him behind his back, inasmuch as in that case there is neither insult nor irreverence? And I think that the same is to be said, even though he does this before others. It must be altogether understood that he does not sin gravely if he curses his parents, whether they are alive or dead, unless the curses are uttered with malevolent meaning.\" This is the decision of one that is called not only a saint, but a \"doctor of the Church\" (Liguori, 'Theol. Moral.,' 4:334). \"Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put ant in obscure darkness,\" says the Word of God (Proverbs 20:20). Nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God. By the last clause the eye is directed to God, who can see and punish, however little the blind man is able to help himself. (Cf. Job 29:15, \"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Justice is to be done to all. The less danger of respecting the person of the poor has to be guarded against, as well as the greater and more obvious peril of honouring the person of the mighty. The scales of Justice must be held even and her eyes bandaged, that she may not prefer one appellant to another on any ground except that of merit and demerit. \"If ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors\" (James 2:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people. For the evil done by mere idle talebearing, see Bishop Butler's sermon, 'Upon the Government of the Tongue,' and four sermons by Bishop Jeremy Taylor, on 'The Good and Evil Tongue; Slander and Flattery; the Duties of the Tongue.' Neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; that is, thou shalt not endanger his life, which is the result of the worst kind of talebearing, namely, bearing false witness against him. Thus the effect of the false witness of the two men of Belial against Naboth was that \"they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died\" (1 Kings 21:13; cf. Matthew 26:60; Matthew 27:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - On the one side we are not to hate our brother in our heart, whatever wrongs he may commit; but on the other side, we are in any wise to rebuke our neighbour for his wrong doing. So our Lord teaches, \"if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him\" (Luke 17:3); and he appoints a solemn mode of procedure, by which this fraternal rebuke is to be conveyed in his Church: \"If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican\" (Matthew 18:15-17). Therefore St. Paul warns his delegates, Timothy and Titus, \"Them that sin rebuke before all\" (1 Timothy 5:20). \"Reprove, rebuke\" (2 Timothy 4:2). \"Rebuke them sharply\" (Titus 1:13). \"Rebuke with all authority\" (Titus 2:15). By withholding reproof in a bitter spirit, or from a feeling of cowardice, we may become partakers of other men's sins. Whoever fails to rebuke his neighbour when he ought to do so, bears sin on his account (the more correct and less ambiguous rendering of the words translated in the Authorized Version, suffer sin upon him, cf. Numbers 18:22, 32). God's people are their brothers' keepers (Genesis 4:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Revenge and malice are forbidden as well as hatred, and the negative precepts culminate in the positive law. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, which sums up in itself one half of the Decalogue (Matthew 22:40). \"For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law\" (Romans 13:8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Ye shall keep my statutes. Having arrived at the general conclusion, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, in the previous verse, the legislator pauses, and then presents a collection of further laws, arranged as before in no special order. The first is a mystical injunction against the confusion of things which are best kept apart, illustrated in three subjects - diverse kinds of cattle in breeding, mingled seeds in sowing a field, and mixed materials in garments. In Deuteronomy 22:10, a fresher illustration is added, \"Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.\" The existence of mules, which we find frequently mentioned in the' later history (2 Samuel 13:29; 2 Samuel 18:9; 1 Kings 1:33), may be accounted for by supposing that the positive precept with regard to breeding cattle here laid down was transgressed, or that the mules were imported from abroad (see 1 Kings 10:25). The word used here and in Deuteronomy 22:11 for a garment mingled of linen and woolen, is shaatenez, an Egyptian word, meaning probably mixed. The difficulty raised on this verse by the allegation that the high priest's dress was made of mixed materials, is met by the answer that, if it were of mixed materials (which is uncertain, for wool is not mentioned in Exodus 28, nor is it quite determined that shesh means linen), the mixture was not such as is here forbidden. The moral meaning of the whole of this injunction is exhibited in the following passages from the New Testament, \"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils\" (1 Corinthians 10:21). \"Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?\" (2 Corinthians 6:14-16). \"He cannot love the Lord Jesus with his heart,\" says Hooker, \"who lendeth one ear to his apostles and another to false teachers, and who can brook to see a mingle-mangle of religion and superstition' ('Serm.' 5:7, quoted by Wordsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-22. - A distinction is drawn between adultery with a free woman, or a betrothed free virgin, which was punishable with death (Leviticus 20:20; Deuteronomy 22:23), and with a slave betrothed to another man (probably a slave also). In the latter ease a lesser punishment, no doubt that of scourging (according to the Mishna to the extent of forty stripes), was to be inflicted on one or both, according to the circumstances of the case. The words, she shall he scourged, should be translated, there shall be investigation, followed, presumably, by the punishment of scourging, for both parties if both were guilty, for one if the woman was unwilling. The man is afterwards to offer a trespass offering. As the offense has been a wrong as well as a sin, his offering is to be a trespass offering (see on Leviticus 5:14). In this case the fine of one-fifth could not be inflicted, as the wrong done could not be estimated by money, and the cost of the ram seems to be regarded as the required satisfaction. No mention is made of damages to be paid to the man to whom the slave-girl was betrothed, probably because he was himself a slave, and had not juridical rights against a freeman.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-25. - The eating of the fruit of young trees by their owners for five years is forbidden, on the principle that such fruit is unclean until it has been sanctified by the offering of a crop as firstfruits to the Lord for the use of the servants of the tabernacle, and a full crop is not to be expected until the fourth year from the time that the trees were planted. The fruit is at first to be counted as uncircumcised, being regarded in a position similar to that of the heathen, that is, unclean, from not having been yet sanctified by the offering of the firstfruits. This sanctification takes place in the fourth year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-28. - After a repetition of the fundamental ceremonial law against eating things which have the blood in them (the LXX. rendering, ἐπὶ τῶν ὀρέων, \"upon the mountains,\" arises from a mistaken reading), follow prohibitionsNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to use enchantment, literally, to whisper or mutter after holding communication with serpents (if the word nichesh be derived from nachash, a serpent);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to observe times, or rather, according to a more probable etymology, exercise the evil eye;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) to round the corners of your heads, that is, use a sort of tonsure, as was done by some Arabian tribes (Herod., 3:3) in honour of their god Orotal, and by the Israelites as a form of mourning (Deuteronomy 14:1; Isaiah 22:12);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) to mar the corners of thy beard, a fashion of mourning which accompanied the tonsure of the head (see Leviticus 21:5; Isaiah 15:2; Jeremiah 48:37;NEWLINENEWLINE(5) to make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, another form of mourning, associated with the two previously mentioned practices (see chapter Leviticus 21:5; Deuteronomy 14:1; Jeremiah 16:6; Jeremiah 41:3; Jeremiah 48:37);NEWLINENEWLINE(6) to print any marks upon you, that is, tattoo themselves in memory of the dead. All these customs were unbecoming the dignity of God's people, and had been connected with idolatrous practices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Do not prostitute thy daughter. This is a peremptory prohibition, applying to every Jewish maiden, introduced in this place with a primary relation to the sanctification of lust by the dedication of young girls at some heathen temples; but by no means confined in its application to such practices. All legal sanction of the sin of prostitution is forbidden, for whatever purpose it may be given; and the certain result of such sanction is indicated in the final words of the verse, lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness (cf. Deuteronomy 23:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The command in this verse differs from that in verse 3 by adding the injunction to reverence my sanctuary to that requiring the observance of the sabbath. It is a matter of experience that where the sabbath is not kept, God's sanctuary is not reverenced, and that that reverence increases or fails away according as the obligation of the sabbatical law, whether in its Jewish form or its Christian form, be more or less recognized. The sabbatical ordinance is necessary as a previous condition of religious worship. Without it, the business and pleasure of the world are too strong to give way to the demands upon time made by the stated service of God. The verse is repeated in Leviticus 26:2. \"When the Lord's day is kept holy, and a holy reverence for the Lord's sanctuary lives in the heart, not only are many sins avoided, but social and domestic life is pervaded by the fear of God, and characterized by devoutness and propriety\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRegard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - This verse contains a prohibition of all dealings with those that have familiar spirits or are wizards. The punishment of such persons is appointed in the next chapter. Both in the Old and the New Testament, the real existence of evil spirits and their power of communicating with the human spirit is assumed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Reverence for the old is inculcated as being a part, not merely of natural respect, but of the fear of God. In the East this virtue, implying deference on the part of the strong to the weak, and of the inexperienced to the wise, exists in larger influence for good than in the West, where, however, its place has been, but only partially, supplied by the greater deference paid by man to woman (cf. Proverbs 16:31; Proverbs 20:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33, 34. - The command already given \"neither to vex a stranger, nor oppress him\" (Exodus 22:21), on the pathetic ground that \"ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 23:9), is broadened in these verses to the positive law, thou shalt love him as thyself. \"The royal law of verse 18 is expressly extended to the stranger, and notwithstanding the national narrowness necessary to preserve the true religion in the world, the general brotherhood of mankind is hereby taught as far as was possible under the circumstances\" (Gardiner).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35, 36. - These verses, beginning with the same words as verse 15, Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, contain another and wider application of that principle. Verse 15 prohibited unrighteousness in the judge, or in one who was in the position of a judge; these verses forbid it in merchants and tradesmen. It is the more necessary to condemn dishonesty, in unmistakable terms, as men who make a profession of religion, and therefore would be shocked at stealing, have often less scruple in cheating. Here and in Deuteronomy, where the Law is repeated, a religious sanction is given to the command; \"For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the Lord thy God\" (Deuteronomy 25:16). Cf. Proverbs 11:1, \"A false balance is abomination to the Lord: but a just weight is his delight;\" and Proverbs 20:10, \"Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord;\" see also Micah 6:10, 11 and Ezekiel 45:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJust balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus19:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Moral precepts are rested on their right foundation - the command of God and the religious motive.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And the LORD called unto Moses. The first word of the verse, in the original Vayikra, meaning \"and called,\" has been taken as the designation of the book in the Hebrew Bible. The title Leviticon, or Leviticus, was first adopted by the LXX., to indicate that it had for its main subject the duties and functions appertaining to the chief house of the priestly tribe of Levi. The word \"and\" connects the third with the second book of the Pentateuch. God is spoken of in this and in the next book almost exclusively under the appellation of \"the LORD\" or \"Jehovah,\" the word \"Elohim\" being, however, used sufficiently often to identify the two names. Cf. Leviticus 2:13, 19:12. And spake unto him. The manner in which God ordinarily communicated with a prophet was by \"a vision\" or \"in a dream;\" but this was not the case with Moses; \"My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently\" (Numbers 12:8). The Levitical code of laws, therefore, was delivered to Moses in his ordinary mental state, not in trance, or dream, or ecstasy. Out of the tabernacle of the congregation. The tabernacle had just been set up by Moses (Exodus 40:16). It derives its name of the congregation, or rather of meeting, from being the place where God met the representatives of his people (see Numbers 16:42). Hitherto God had spoken from the mount, now he speaks from the mercy-seat of the ark in the tabernacle. He had symbolically drawn near to his people, and the sacrificial system is now instituted as the means by which they should draw nigh to him. All the laws in the Book of Leviticus, and in the first ten chapters of the Book of Numbers, were given during the fifty days which intervened between the setting up of the tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the departure of the children of Israel from the neighbourhood of Mount Sinai (Numbers 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - If any man of you bring. Sacrifices are not now being instituted for the first time. Burnt offerings at least, if not peace offerings, had existed since the time of the Fall. The Levitical law lays down regulations adapting an already existing practice for the use of the Israelitish nation; it begins, therefore, not with a command, \"Thou shalt bring,\" but, if any man of you (according to custom) bring. Any member of the congregation might bring his voluntary offering when he would. The times at which the public offerings were to be made, and their number, are afterwards designated. An offering. This verse is introductory to the ensuing chapters, and speaks of \"offerings\" in general. \"Kor-ban,\" which is the word here used for \"offering,\" derived from karab, meaning \"to draw near for the sake of presentation,\" is the generic name including all offerings and sacrifices. It is used in speaking of animal sacrifices of various kinds, including peace offerings and sin offerings (Leviticus 3:1; Leviticus 4:23 and it is applied to vegetable offerings (Leviticus 2:1, 13) and to miscellaneous offerings for the service of the tabernacle, such as wagons and oxen, silver vessels for the altar, gold, jewels, etc. (Numbers 7:3, 10; Numbers 31:50). It is translated by the LXX. into Greek by the word δῶρον, equivalent to the Latin donum, and our \"gift.\" These offerings are now distinguished into their different kinds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If his offering be a burnt sacrifice. The Hebrew term for \"burnt sacrifice\" is olah, meaning \"that which ascends;\" sometimes kaleel \"whole offering,\" is found (Deuteronomy 33:10); the LXX. use the word ὁλοκαύτωμα, \"whole burnt offering.\" The conditions to be fulfilled by an Israelite who offered a burnt sacrifice were the following: -NEWLINENEWLINE1.

To carry them outside the camp to a clean place, the bearer being dressed in his ordinary costume (Leviticus 6:11). There were, therefore, four essential parts in the ritual of the burnt offering - the oblation of the victim (verses 3, 4), the immolation (verse 5), the oblation of the blood, representing the life (ibid.), and the consumption (verse 9) - the first two to be performed by the offerer, the third by the priest, the fourth by the fire representing the action of God. The moral lesson taught by the burnt offering was the necessity of self-surrender and of devotion to God, even to the extent of yielding up life and the very tenement of life. As the offerer could not give up his own life and body and still live, the life of an animal belonging to him, and valued by him, was substituted for his own; but he knew, and by laying his hand on its head showed that he knew, that it was his own life and his very self that was represented by the animal. The mystical lessons taught to those who could grasp them were -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The doctrine of substitution or vicarious suffering.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The fact that without the shedding of blood there was no acceptance.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The need of One who, being very man, should be able to perform an action of perfect surrender of his will and of his life. The fulfilment of the type is found in the perfect submission of Christ as man, throughout his ministry, and especially in the Garden of Gethsemane, and in the offering made by him, as Priest and willing Victim, of his life upon the altar of the cross. the burnt offering is to be without blemish, for had not the animal been perfect in its kind, it would not have served its moral, its mystical, or its typical purpose. The word ἄμωμος, used by the LXX. as equivalent to the Hebrew term, is applied to Christ in Hebrews 9:14 and 1 Peter 1:19; and St. Paul teaches that it is the purpose of God that those who are adopted in Christ should also be \"holy and without blemish\" (Ephesians 1:4). A priest had to certify that the victim was free kern all defects. He shall offer it of his own voluntary will should rather be translated, He shall offer it for his own acceptance. The animal, representing the offerer, was presented by the latter in order that he might be himself accepted by the Lord. This aspect of the offering is brought out more clearly by the minchah, or meat offering, which always accompanied the burnt offering. The place where the presentation took place was the door of the tabernacle, that is, the space immediately within the eastern entrance into the court of the tabernacle, immediately facing the brazen altar, which stood before the east end of the tabernacle, where was the door or entrance which led into the holy place. \"The presenting of the victim at the entrance of the tabernacle was a symbol of the free will submitting itself to the Law of the Lord\" (Clarke). Cf. Romans 12:1: \"I beseech you that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering. This putting, or forcibly leaning, the hand on the victim's head, which is the most essential part of the oblation of the victim, was a symbolical act implying \"This animal is now for present purposes myself, and its life is my life.\" It was this act of identification with the offerer which made it be accepted for him to make atonement (literally, covering) for him. The sin offering is the sacrifice which especially symbolizes and ceremonially effects atonement, but the idea of atonement is not absent from the burnt sacrifice. The aspect under which atonement is presented here and elsewhere in the Old Testament is that of covering. But it is not the sin that is covered, but the sinner. Owing to his sin, the latter is exposed to the wrath of a just God, but something intervenes whereby he is covered, and he ceases, therefore, to attract the Divine anger and punishment. No longer being an object of wrath, he becomes at once an object of benevolence and mercy. The covering provided by a sacrifice is the blood or life of an animal, symbolically representing the offerer's own life freely surrendered by him for his acceptance, and typically foreshadowing the blood of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And he shall kill the bullock. After having made the presentation, the offerer proceeds to the second part of the sacrifice, the immolation or slaying, which was to be performed before the Lord, that is, in front of the tabernacle, on the north side of the brazen altar. Then follows the third part of the sacrifice: the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar. The priests caught the blood (sometimes the Levites were allowed to do this, 2 Chronicles 30:16), and sprinkled or rather threw it round about on the altar, that is, so as to touch all the inner sides of the altar. \"A red line all round the middle of the altar marked that above it the blood of sacrifices intended to be eaten, below it that of sacrifices wholly consumed, was to be sprinkled\" (Edersheim, 'The Temple'). This was in some respects the most essential part of the ceremony, the blood representing the life (chapter 17:11), which was symbolically received at the hands of the offerer, and presented by the priests to God. In the antitype our Lord exercised the function of the sacrificing priest when he presented his own life to the Father, as he hung upon the altar of the cross.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He shall flay the burnt offering. The hide was given to the priest (Leviticus 7:8). The whole of the remainder of the animal was consumed by the fire of the altar; none of it was eaten by the offerer and his friends as in the peace offerings, or even by the ministers of God as in the sin offerings; it was a whole burnt offering. His pieces, into which it was to be cut, means the customary pieces.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The priest shall put fire upon the altar. The fire once kindled was never to be allowed to go out (Leviticus 6:13). Unless, therefore, these words refer to the first occasion only on which a burnt sacrifice was offered, they must mean \"make up the fire on the altar\" or it might possibly have been the practice, as Bishop Wordsworth (after Maimonides) supposes, that fresh fire was added to the altar fire before each sacrifice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the priests shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order. The head and the fat are designated by name, because, with the \"pieces,\" they complete the whole of the animal with the exception of the hide. The order in which they were laid is said to have been the same approximately as that which the members held in the living creature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The priest shall burn all on the altar, etc. The fourth and last part of the sacrifice. The word employed is not the common term used for destroying by fire, but means \"make to ascend.\" The life of the animal has already been offered in the blood; now the whole of its substance is \"made to ascend\" to the Lord. Modern science, by showing that the effect of fire upon the substance of a body is to resolve it into gases which rise from it, contributes a new illustration to the verse. The vapour that ascends is not something different from that which is burnt, but the very thing itself, its essence; which, having ascended, is of a sweet savour unto the Lord, that is, acceptable and well-pleasing to him. The burnt offering, the meat offering, and the peace offering, are sacrifices of sweet savour (Leviticus 2:2; Leviticus 3:5); the expression is not used with regard to the sin offering and trespass offering. St. Paul applies it to the sacrifice of Christ, in Ephesians 5:2, \"As Christ also loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour;\" thus indicating, in an incidental manner, the connection between the Jewish sacrifices and the sacrifice of Christ, as type and antitype.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - If his offering be of the flocks. The ritual of the burnt offering was the same. whether the victim was a hull, sheep, or goat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He shall kill it on the side of the altar, northward before the Lord. In the sacrifice of the bullock it is only \"before the Lord\" (verse 5). No doubt the same place is meant in both cases, but it is specified with more exactness here. On the western side of the altar was the tabernacle, on the east side the heap of ashes (Leviticus 1:16), on the south side probably the ascent to the altar (see Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5:05, 6); on the north side, therefore, was the most convenient slaughtering place, and this is probably the reason for the injunction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - If the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls. A comparison of Leviticus 12:8 leads us to infer that the permission to offer a bird was a concession to poverty. The pigeon and the turtle-dove were the most easy to procure, as the domestic fowl was at this time unknown to the Hebrews. The first and only allusion in the Bible to the hen occurs in the New Testament (Matthew 23:37; Luke 13:30, nor is there any representation of the domestic fowl in ancient Egyptian paintings. The domicile of the bird was still confined to India. A single pigeon or turtle-dove formed a sacrifice, and there was no rule in respect to sex, as there was in the case of the quadrupeds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The priest shall bring it unto the altar. The difference in the ritual for the burnt sacrifice of fowls is:NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the offerer is not commanded to lay his hand on the bird.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That the altar is the place of maciation, instead of the space on the north side of the altar.NEWLINENEWLINE3. That the priest slays it instead of the offerer.NEWLINENEWLINE4. That the blood (owing to its smaller quantity) is pressed out against the side of the altar instead of being caught in a vessel and thrown on it. There is no essential variation here; the analogy of the sacrifice of the animal is followed so far as circumstances permit. It is not certain that the word malak, translated wring off his head, means more than \"make an incision with the nail;\" but in all probability the head was to be severed and laid on the fire separately, after the manner of the other sacrifices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - With his feathers, rather the contents of the crop. This and the ashes are to be placed beside the altar on the east part, as being furthest from the tabernacle and nearest to the entrance of the court, so that they might be readily removed.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEThe subject of chapter 18, is resumed in this chapter; but that which was before considered as sin only is now regarded as crime, and penalties are attached according to the heinousness of the offense. For example, the sin of \"giving of his seed to Molech,\" or which is the same thing, \"letting any of his seed pass through the fire to Molech,\" had been forbidden as a sin in chapter Leviticus 18:21; now it is condemned as a crime. The various penalties assigned in this chapter areNEWLINENEWLINE(1) burning with fire (verse 14);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) stoning with stones (verses 2, 27);NEWLINENEWLINE(3) being put to death in a manner not specified (verses 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16);NEWLINENEWLINE(4) being cut off from among his people, either by God himself (verses 4, 5, 6) or by an agency not specified (verses 17, 18);NEWLINENEWLINE(5) bearing his iniquity (verses 17, 19, 20);NEWLINENEWLINE(6) childlessness (verses 20, 21).NEWLINENEWLINEThe first of these penalties, burning with fire, does not mean that those on whom it was inflicted were burnt alive, but that their dead bodies were burnt after they had been stoned to death, as in the case of Achan (Joshua 7:25). It is the punishment for taking a mother and daughter together into the same harem (verse 14). Stoning with stones is appointed for crimes which are at once offenses against religion and morals, viz. giving of his seed to Molech (verse 2), and witchcraft (verse 27). The other form of putting to death, which no doubt was strangling, is the penalty assigned to cursing parents (verse 9), adultery (verse 10), marriage or intercourse with a stepmother (verse 11) or stepdaughter (verse 12), the sin of Sodom (verse 13), and bestiality (verses 15, 16). Cutting off from his people may be effected either by death (verses 4, 5, and perhaps 6), which is the penalty for Molech-worship, connivance at Molech-worship, and dealing with witches; or by excommunication (verses 17, 18), which was the punishment for intercourse with a sister, or with one who was unclean by reason of her monthly sickness (see Exodus 31:14). The phrase, bearing his iniquity, means that the man continues in the state of a criminal until he has been cleansed either by suffering the punishment of his offense or making atonement for it, which sometimes he might, sometimes he might not, do. The man who committed incest with a sister would \"bear his iniquity\" (verse 17), because he would be put in a state of excommunication without permission of restoration by means of sacrificial offerings. And so with the man who took his aunt by blood (verse 19) or by marriage (verse 20) as his wife, - he would not be allowed to recover his status by offering sacrifice. Childlessness, the punishment for marrying an uncle's or brother's wife, probably means that in those cases the offender's children should not be counted as his own, but should be entered in the genealogical register as his uncle's or his brother's children. (Cf. Deuteronomy 25:10, where it is noticeable that the penalty is retained, even though the marriage with the brother's wife, which had been prohibited in general, had in the particular case become a duty for family or tribal reasons.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - The close connection between giving of his seed unto Molech and defiling my sanctuary, and profaning my holy name, is explained and illustrated by Ezekiel in the judgment on Aholah and Aholibah. \"They have caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house\" (Ezekiel 23:37-39). Not only was the juxtaposition and combination of the worship of Molech and Jehovah an offense to him whose name is Jealous, but at the time that Molech-worship was carried on in the valley of Hinnom, idols were set up in the court of the temple itself, as we learn from the Book of Kings and from Jeremiah. \"But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my Name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which! commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin\" (Jeremiah 32:34, 35). And of Manasseh it is related, \"He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my Name. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire\" (2 Kings 21:4-6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - There is to be no connivance with Molech-worship. The penalty is death, and is to be carried out by the proper tribunals, whose business it was to see that the stoning took place. So in Deuteronomy the duty of killing those who entice to idolatry is laid down. \"Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shall thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people\" (Deuteronomy 13:8, 9). In the case of Molech-worship God declares that, if the tribunals of the nation fail to adjudge the penalty of death to the offender, he will himself lake the matter into his hands, and cut him off with his family and all that follow him in his sin of unfaithfulness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - God will also himself cut off from among his people any that, not content with lawful and godly knowledge, turn after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - A positive command, Sanctify yourselves therefore, and he ye holy: for I am the Lord your God, is introduced early in the list of penalties to show what is the main purpose of the latter. The only way in which the nation can recover holiness lost by the sins of its members, is by the punishment of the latter, or by their purification by means of sacrifice, according to the nature of the offense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - See above, the note on chapter Leviticus 19:14, which shows how God's word is made of none effect by man's traditions. God says that a man who curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death. Human authority, incontrovertible throughout a great part of Christendom, declares that in most cases it is no grave sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The Hebrew punishment for adultery is more severe than that of most other nations. Death is again pronounced as the penalty of both adulterer and adulteress in Deuteronomy 22:22. The crime is that of a man with a married woman, whether the man be married or not; it is not that of a married man with an unmarried woman, which, in a country where polygamy was allowed, could not be regarded in the same light.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - It should be noted that intercourse with a stepmother or daughter-in-law are put, by the punishment inflicted upon them, on the same level with adultery and unnatural crimes (verses 10, 13, 15, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-19. - (See Leviticus 18:22, 17, 23, 9, 19, 12.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - They shall die childless;... they shall be childless. \"It cannot be supposed that a perpetual miracle was to be maintained through all the ages of Israel's history; but the meaning evidently is that the children of such marriages should be reckoned, not to their actual father, but to the former husband of the woman.

The priest may not take part in any funeral rites, the effect of which was legal defilement, except in the case of the death of his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, and unmarried sister. These are all that appear to be mentioned. But what, then, are we to understand regarding his wife? Was the priest allowed to lake part in mourning ceremonies for her or not? It is thought by some that her case is met by verse 4, But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. The literal translation of this verse is. He shall not be defiled, a lord (haul) among his people. The word baal, or lord, is commonly used in the sense of husband. The clause, therefore, may be understood to forbid the priest to mourn for his wife, being rendered, He shall not defile himself as an husband (i.e., for his wife) among his people. This, however, is something of a forced rendering. The words arc better understood to mean, He shall not defile himself as a master of a house among his people; that is, he may not lake part in the funeral rites of slaves or other members of the household, which ordinarily brought defilement on the master of a house. Then is the priest forbidden to mourn for his wife? This we can hardly believe, when he might mourn for father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. Nor is it necessary to take this view. For the case of the wife is covered by the words. For his kin, that is near unto him.... he may be defiled. The wife, being so closely attached to the husband, is not specifically named, because that was not necessary, but is included under the expression, his kin, that is near unto him, just as daughter, grandmother, niece, and wife's sister, are covered by the phrase, \"near of kin,\" without being specifically named in chapter Leviticus 18 (see note on chapter Leviticus 16:18). Even when mourning is permitted, the priest is to use no excessive forms of it, still less any that have been used by idolaters. They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard (see Leviticus 19:27), nor make any cuttings in their flesh (see Leviticus 19:28). And the reason why they are to avoid ceremonial uncleanness in some cases, and to act with sobriety and gravity in all, is that they are dedicated to God, to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the bread of their God; that is, the sacrifices which are consumed by the fire of the altar symbolizing the action of God (see note on Leviticus 3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-9. - Moral uncleanness or defilement passes to the husband and father kern an immoral wife or daughter, and therefore the priest is to be specially careful in the selection of his wife; and his daughter, if she leads a licentious life, is to be stoned to death, and then burnt with fire, because she profaneth her father (cf. 1 Samuel 2:17). In a similar spirit, St. Paul gives directions as to the families of those to whom the ministry of the Spirit is assigned (1 Timothy 3:11; Titus 1:6). Keil would unite verse 4 in sense with verses 7-9, and argues that he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself, refers to the kind of marriage which the priest is to make, but the interposition of verses 5 and 6 forbid this explanation of verse 4.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-15. - The high priest, upon whose head the anointing off was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, symbolizing in his person the Holy One in a more special manner than the other priests, has to aim so much the more at symbolical holiness. He may not, therefore. incur legal uncleanness by taking part in the funeral rites, even of his father or mother, not being permitted to absent himself from the sanctuary, which he would have to do if he had thus ceremonially defiled himself. Nor is it enough that he should abstain from taking an immoral or a divorced wife; he may only wed a virgin and of his own people, whereas the other priests might marry widows and the daughters of strangers dwelling among the Israelites. In the ordinances for priests given in Ezekiel 44, the ordinary priests, as well as the high priest, are forbidden to marry widows, unless they be the widows of priests (Ezekiel 44:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take a wife in her virginity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-24. - Perfection of the body being typical of perfection of the mind and of the whole man, and symbolical perfection being required of the priest of God, none may be admitted to the priesthood with bodily defects, or excrescences, or grievous blemishes. The translation dwarf, in verse 20, is better than the marginal rendering \"too slender,\" or withered. Being the descendants of Aaron, these priests, blemished as they were, were to be supported as the other priests were supported. He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy; that is, the priests' portions of the meat offerings (Leviticus 2:3, 10; Leviticus 6:17), of the sin offerings (Leviticus 6:29), of the trespass offerings (Leviticus 7:1), of the shewbread (Leviticus 24:9), which were most holy, and of the heave offerings, wave offerings, firstfruit offerings, firstlings, and things devoted (Numbers 11:11-19), which were holy. They were also apparently employed in the less formal and conspicuous duties of the priests, such as examining lepers, and any other functions which did not bring them nigh unto the altar. But they were not to profane God's sanctuaries, by which is meant the holy of holies, the holy place, and the court in which the altar stood. To none of these is the blemished priest to be admitted for the purpose of officiating, though he might enter the court and probably the holy place for other purposes, and might eat the offerings of the priests in the accustomed place.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-9. - In the previous chapter, the priests have been commanded to avoid occasions of ceremonial defilement, but there are times in which they must be unclean. At these times they are here instructed that they must abstain from their priestly functions, and not even eat of the priests' portions until they have been cleansed. The command to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, in verse 2, must be read in the light of the following verses, and understood to mean that they are to separate themselves from the holy things when they are unclean. The different forms of uncleanness which are to produce this effect are enumerated in verses 4-6. In most cases the uncleanness would not last beyond sunset on the day on which it was incurred, but occasionally, as when a priest became a leper, a permanent disqualification would be caused, or one that lasted for a considerable length of time. The law with respect to abstaining from holy things while unclean is to be of permanent obligation. Whoever disobeys it is to be cut off from God's presence; that is, he is to be excluded from the sanctuary by being deprived of his priestly office. Verse 8 repeats the prohibition of eating flesh containing blood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSay unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.

The answer is, the priest's family. The members of the priest's family here specified are those only about whom any question might have arisen, namely, the slaves, who, as bring incorporated into the priest's household, have a right of eating of the priestly food not enjoyed by lodgers in his house or by servants hired with his money; and married daughters who have returned to their father's roof in consequence of the death of their husband, or of being divorced, without any children of their own. Under these circumstances, it is ruled that they become once more a part of the priest's family, and able to exercise the privileges of that position. The priest's wife and sons and unmarried daughters are not here mentioned, as no question arose about them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As the sacrificial meals made a part of the stipends of the priestly body, any one who inadvertently took a share in them by eating of the holy thing unwittingly, when he had no right to do so, had to refund the value of the meat, with one fifth, that is, twenty percent, added to it. He thus acknowledged that he had \"committed a trespass in the holy things of the Lord,\" the case falling under the rule given in chapter Leviticus 5:15, 16, \"And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest.\" In the fifth chapter a trespass offering of a ram is also ordered, which, though not specified, is probably understood here also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - These verses present some difficulties of construction. The rendering of the Authorized Version is as follows: And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord; or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the Lord do sanctify them. If this rendering is accepted, it would mean that the priests are not to profane the holy things by any irregularity on their part as to the eating of them, nor to suffer laymen to incur the guilt of a trespass by eating them. The marginal rendering, which is to be preferred, gives the passage as follows: And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord; or lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass in their eating. According to this translation, the meaning would be that laymen (who had been spoken of in the previous verse) should not profane the holy things, or become guilty of a trespass (as defined in verse 15) by eating them. Technically and literally, David was guilty of this trespass in an aggravated form, when he and his followers ate the shewbread at Nob (1 Samuel 21:6), for the shewbread was not only holy, but most holy. But his act is excused by our Lord, on the plea of necessity (Matthew 12:3, 4), even though it was done on the sabbath day (1 Samuel 21:5, margin).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-25. - Just as the priests who offer to the Lord are to be ceremonially and morally holy, so the animals offered to him are to be physically perfect, in orderNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to be types of a future perfect Victim,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to symbolize the \"perfect heart\"which God requires to be given to him, andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) to teach the duty of offering to him of our best. Whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer. The list of blemishes and malformations which exclude from the altar is given; they are such as deform the animal, and make it less valuable: blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, nor any animal that is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, that is, castrated in any manner. The clause following the mention of castration - neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land - literally translated, neither shall ye make in your land, probably forbids castration altogether, not merely the offering of castrated animals in sacrifice. The expression, Ye shall offer at your own will, should be understood, as before, for your acceptance (see note on Leviticus 2:1). Only one exception is made as to blemished offerings: an animal that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts may be offered for a freewill offering, but not for a vow (for the distinction of these offerings, see note on chapter Leviticus 2:1). These rules as to unblemished victims are to apply to the offerings of strangers as well as of Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEither a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - Extreme youth is to be regarded as a blemish in an animal in the same way as other defects. During the young creature's first week of existence it is not considered as having arrived at the perfection of its individual and separate life, and therefore only from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the Lord. Up to what ago an animal might be offered is not stated. Gideon is narrated as offering a bullock of seven years old (Judges 6:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - A lesson of charity is added. A young animal and its mother are not to be killed (though reference is specially made to sacrifice, the general word, not the sacrificial term, for slaying is used) on the same day, just as the kid is not to be seethed in its mother's milk (Exodus 23:19; Deuteronomy 14:21), nor the mother bird be taken from the nest with the young (Deuteronomy 22:6). Thus we see that the feelings of the human heart arc not to be rudely shocked by an act of apparent cruelty, even when no harm is thereby done to the object of that act. Mercy is to be taught by forbidding anything which may blunt the sentiment of mercy in the human heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - Two forms of peace offerings, the vowed and the voluntary offerings, having been mentioned in verse 21, the law as to the third form, thanksgiving offerings, is repeated from chapter Leviticus 7:15 (where see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-33. - These verses form the conclusion of the Section and of the Part, enjoining obedience to God's commandments, reverence for his Name, and consequent holiness.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus22:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEPART IV.NEWLINEHOLY DAYS AND SEASONS: WEEKLY, MONTHLY, ANNUAL,NEWLINESEPTENNIAL, AND EVERY HALF-CENTURY.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 23. THIS Part consists of chapters 23, and 25, with chapter 24 parenthetically introduced. Every religion must have its round of holy days and seasons:NEWLINENEWLINE1. To give occasion for manifesting joyous thankfulness to the Giver of all good things.NEWLINENEWLINE2. To keep alive the memory of past events around which religious associations cling.NEWLINENEWLINE3. To impress upon the hearts of the worshippers those sacred mysteries which are regarded as essential characteristics of the system.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The duty and happiness of rejoicing before the Lord find a prominent place under the Mosaic dispensation, as they must in any religion where man feels himself in a covenant relation with God, brought nigh to him by himself, and no longer estranged from him who is his only true life and happiness. Accordingly, the first thought of the annual Jewish festivals is that of joyous thankfulness, such as is becoming to reconciled children grateful to their Father for the many bounties that they receive at his hands. The first gift of God of which man becomes conscious is that of the daily sustenance provided for him, and therefore we should expect holy days to be appointed to commemorate the goodness of God in bestowing the gifts of the earth. The first aspect, therefore, in which to regard the three great annual festivals - the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles - is that they were days of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth dispensed by God to man. First, with regard to the Passover. We read at verses 10, 11, \"When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf [or an omer] of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.\" The words, \"the morrow after the sabbath,\" mean, as we shall see, the day after the first day of Unleavened Bread, that is, the second day of the feast, Nisan 16, which fell early in April, when the first barley was ripening in Palestine. On the 14th day of Nisan (the day of the Paschal sacrifice) a certain quantity of standing barley was marked off, by men specially appointed for the purpose, in a field ploughed the previous autumn and sown at least ten weeks before the Passover, but not prepared artificially in such a way as to hasten the crop. On the following day, Nisan 15, at sunset, three men were sent to the selected field, and, in the presence of witnesses, cut the ears of corn before marked, and brought them into the temple. On the next day, Nisan 16, this corn, whether in the form of a sheaf or of flour, was offered to the Lord by being waved before him, and then consigned to the priest. Here, by the presentation of the firstfruits of the year, an acknowledgment is made that the products of the earth are by right God's. This is one of the objects of the Feast of the Passover. Secondly, as to Pentecost. After the sheaf, or omer, had been offered on Nisan 16, it was allowable to make the new year's barley into bread, but the dedication of the grain crops was not complete until a portion of the wheat crop had also been offered. This was done a week of weeks later, at the Feast of Pentecost, forty-nine days after the presentation of the barley, and fifty days after the first day of Unleavened Bread. On this day, two leavened loaves, of the same size as the shewbread loaves, were waved before the Lord, and then delivered to the priest. These loaves were made out of ears of corn selected and reaped as the barley had been seven weeks before, and then threshed and ground in the temple. They were regarded as the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, though they were not made of the first cut wheat; and from their presentation the festival has the name of the Feast of Harvest (Exodus 23:16); the Feast of the Firstfruits of the Wheat Harvest (Exodus 24:22); the Day of the Firstfruits (Numbers 28:26); while, from its date relatively to the Passover, it is called the Feast of Weeks (Exodus 34:22; Deuteronomy 16:10). The name, Feast of Pentecost, is found only in the Apocrypha (Tobit 2:1; 2 Macc. 12:32), and in the New Testament (Acts 2:1; Acts 20:16; 1 Corinthians 16:8). The meat offerings might not be made of the new year's flour until these two loaves had been offered. Thirdly, with regard to the Feast of Tabernacles. The festivals connected with the seasons of the year and the products of the soil were not ended until the Feast of Ingathering (Exodus 23:16; Exodus 34:22), or Tabernacles (verse 34; Deuteronomy 16:13; Ezra 3:4; Zechariah 14:16; Jeremiah 7:2), had been celebrated. This festival occurred about the beginning of October, and commemorated the final gathering in of all the fruits of the year, specially of the olives and the grapes. It was observed by a general dwelling in booths made of the branches of palms, willows, olives, pines, myrtles, and other close-growing trees (verse 40; Nehemiah 8:15), in which all the Israelite males, with the exception of the sick, lived for seven days, and kept harvest home.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The second aspect in which to regard the annum festivals is the historical one. The Passover is characterized by its historical associations to a greater degree than either of the other festivals. The whole national life of the Israelites received its character from the Egyptian Exodus, and accordingly the anniversaries of their religious year began with its commemoration. It was the events which had taken place in Egypt which gave to the Paschal sacrifice and the Paschal feast their primary signification; and while to us the Passover festival serves as a proof of the truth of those events, to the Jew it served as a memorial of them, preventing them from ever being forgotten or disregarded (cf. Exodus 13:3-16). The ancient Christian Fathers suggested that the Feast of Pentecost commemorated the institution of the old dispensation at Sinai, as, to Christians, it recalled the institution of the new Law by the gift of the fiery tongues at Jerusalem. This suggestion was adopted by Maimonides and the later school of Hebrew commentators, and it is a very probable conjecture; but as no appearance of it is found in the Old or New Testaments, nor even in early Hebrew writers, it cannot be regarded as a certainty. Historically, the Feast of Tabernacles is generally considered to commemorate the dwelling in tents throughout the forty years' wandering in the wilderness; but if this were so, it would have been called the Feast of Tents, for the words \"tent\" and \"tabernacle\" differ, and the Israelites did not dwell in tabernacles in the wilderness. Rather, it commemorates the first encampment of the Israelites after setting forth from Egypt, which took place at \"Succoth,\" the meaning of which word is \"tabernacle\" (Exodus 12:37). Thus, as the event historically associated with the first harvest festival, the Passover, was the setting forth from Egypt, that associated with the last, the Feast of Tabernacles, was the resting at the end of the first day's journey at Succoth, where the people now felt that they were free, and began to rejoice in their freedom.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The typical character of the feasts, as well as their historical character, is more apparent in the Passover than in the other two feasts. St. Paul's testimony on this point is sufficient: \"For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth\" (1 Corinthians 5:7). Here we have the typical character of the Paschal lamb, and of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, authoritatively declared to us. The blood of the lamb slain on the night before the Exodus, being the means whereby the Israelites were delivered from the destruction which fell on all the rest of the inhabitants of the land, typified the still more efficacious bloodshedding by which the redemption of Christ's people was wrought. The Feast of Pentecost, if it commemorated the gift of the Law at Mount Sinai, pointed thereby to the giving of the better Law on the day when the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles in Jerusalem; and in any case, as a Feast of Firstfruits, it was emblematic of those firstfruits of the Christian Church presented to God on that day (Acts 2:41). The Feast of Tabernacles, in which God's people commemorated their rejoicing in their newly found liberty after the slavery of Egypt, awaits its full typical fulfillment in the spiritual joy of the redeemed after they have been delivered from the burden of the flesh and the sufferings of the world; but its typical meaning is partially fulfilled in the blessed peace and joy spread abroad in the hearts of the children of God by reason of their adoption in Christ, whereby we have obtained an inheritance with the saints (Ephesians 1:11, 18). In the annual fast held on the 10th of Tisri, the great Day of Atonement, the typical element outweighs any other. The present and the past sink away in comparison with the future. The day suggests no thought of the seasons or of the products of the earth, and it recalls no event of past history. It teaches a lesson - the need of reconciliation; and by the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies with sacrificial blood, and by the ceremony of the scapegoat, it typically foreshadows how that reconciliation is to he effected. The monthly festivals had a purpose different from the annual. They occurred on the new moon, or the first day of each month, and their intention was to dedicate each month to God. Only one of these monthly festivals is mentioned in this chapter the Feast of Trumpets. It is the feast of the new moon of the sacred seventh month, with which the civil year began. Because it was New Year's Day, it had more ceremonies attached to it than the first days of the other months. Whereas the feasts of the new moons in other months only sanctified the special month which they began, the Feast of Trumpets sanctified also the whole year, and was therefore an annual as well as a monthly feast. The weekly festival was the sabbath (see Exodus 20:10; Deuteronomy 5:15). This feast sanctified each week, as the monthly feasts sanctified each month; and like the annual festivals, it looked both backwards and forwards: backwards, to the sanctification bestowed upon it \"Because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made\" (Genesis 2:3); forwards, to the great sabbath in which Christ rested in the grave, and yet further onwards to another sabbath still to be enjoyed by the people of God. The sabbatical year and the jubilee were extensions of the sabbatical principle - certain civil and religious institutions and regulations being attached to each of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Concerning the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts. The translation should rather be, The appointed times which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, these are my appointed times. The appointed times (mo'adin) include the great fast as well as the festivals, and the weekly and monthly as well as the annual holy days. The primary purpose with which the following enumeration of holy days is introduced, is to give a list of the holy convocations. While the Israelites were still dwelling in the wilderness, a holy convocation appears to have been a religious assembly of all the males in the court of the tabernacle. After the settlement in Canaan, a religious gathering for prayer or festive rejoicing in all their dwellings, that is, wherever they lived, would have satisfied the command to hold a holy convocation, except on the three great festivals, when all who could, \"kept the feast\" at Jerusalem. There were in all seven holy convocations in the year, besides the sabbath, namely, the first and last days of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Pentecost, the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Trumpets, the first and last days of the Feast of Tabernacles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The seventh day is the sabbath of rest. This is a very strong expression, literally, the sabbath of sabbatism, which doubles the force of the single word. Ye shall do no work therein. The sabbath and the Day of Atonement were the only days in which no work might be done, whereas on the other festivals it was only no servile work that might be done. It is not to be observed solely where the tabernacle is pitched or the temple is built, but in every town and village of Canaan - in all your dwellings. In the sanctuary itself the peculiar characteristics of the sabbath were a holy convocation, the renewal of the shewbread, and the burnt offering of two lambs with their meat and drink offerings (Numbers 28:9, 10); elsewhere it was observed only by the holy convocation and rest from all labour. It commenced at sunset on Friday evening, and continued till sunset on Saturday evening. In later days the hour at which it began was announced by three blasts of the priests' trumpets, immediately after which a new course of priests entered on their ministry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - This verse repeats the statement or heading contained in verse 2, with reference to the annual holy day, the sabbath having been disposed of in verse 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD'S passover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's passover. The month of Nisan was made the first month of the religious year in consequence of the original Passover having taken place in it (Exodus 12:2). On the occasion of the first, or Egyptian, Passover, all heads of a family, either singly or two or three heads of families in conjunction, provided themselves with a lamb or a kid on the 10th day of Nisan, killed it in the evening of the 14th, and, taking a bunch of hyssop, dipped it in the blood and struck the lintel and two side posts of the doors of their houses with the blood. They then roasted the animal whole for eating, added to it unleavened bread, and garnished it with bitter herbs. They made themselves ready to eat it by dressing themselves for a journey, \"with their loins girded, their shoes on their feet, and their staff in their hands\" (Exodus 12:11), and thus they ate it in haste, in a standing position. The meaning of the ceremony is explained by what was taking place at the same time. On the same night, after the blood had been sprinkled upon the lintel and side posts, God slew the firstborn of all who had not exhibited this symbol of their having been brought into covenant with himself, and the Israelites set off hurriedly on their departure from Egypt. It was commanded that the day should be kept hereafter in like manner as a memorial, and that the following seven days should be kept as a Feast of Unleavened Bread (Exodus 12:14, 15). This command is here concisely repeated, as it is again repeated in Deuteronomy 16:1-8. One very considerable change was, however, necessarily made in the method of its observance. Originally, each head of a household or combination of households sacrificed the lamb himself, and sprinkled the blood upon the doorposts and lintel. But after the establishment of the Aaronic priesthood and the withdrawal of the priestly authority previously vested in each head of a house (chapters 8, 9), and after the stringent prohibition of sacrificing elsewhere than in the court of the tabernacle had been issued (chapter 17), this could not continue. Accordingly, we find in the Book of Deuteronomy the direct injunction, \"Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee: but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his Name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt\" (Deuteronomy 16:5, 6). A result from this rule was that every male Israelite had to present himself at Jerusalem, and there slay his lamb on the day of the Passover, which in the time of Nero, brought between two and three million pilgrims to Jerusalem each year. The crowd of pilgrims took their way to the temple, and were admitted into the court in three divisions. There they slew each man his lamb, while the priests offered the blood on the altar, and the Levites sang the Hallel (Psalm 113-118). Then they bore away the lambs, roasted them whole on a spit of pomegranate wood, taking care that no bone should be broken, and prepared the Paschal supper. At the supper, as well as at the sacrifice, a change of manner was introduced. \"As the guests gathered round the Paschal table, they came no longer, as at the first celebration, with their loins girded, with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hands; that is, as travelers waiting to take their departure. On the contrary, they were arrayed in their best festive garments, joyous and at rest, as became the children of a king. To express this idea, the rabbis also insisted that the Paschal supper, or at least part of it, must be eaten in that recumbent position with which we are familiar from the New Testament. 'For,' say they, 'they use this leaning posture, as free men do, in memorial of their freedom.' And again, 'Because it is the manner of slaves to eat standing, therefore now they eat sitting and leaning, in order to show that they have been delivered from bondage into freedom.' And finally, 'No, not the poorest in Israel may eat till he has sat down, leaning.' But though it was deemed desirable to sit leaning during the whole Paschal supper, it was only absolutely enjoined while partaking of the bread and the wine\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The essentials of the Paschal feast were the Paschal lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs (Exodus 12:8). To these were afterwards added a dish formed from an animal sacrificed on the Passover day, a composition of dates and other dried fruits, and four cups of red wine mixed with water, the last of which came to be regarded as essential as that which had been commanded in the Law. The Rabbi Gamaliel is reported by the Mishna to have said, \"Whoever fails to explain three things in the Passover fails to fulfill his duty. These are the Paschal lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. The Paschal lamb means that God passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt, which were sprinkled with blood; the unleavened bread, that our fathers were hurried out of Egypt; the bitter herbs, that the Egyptians made the lives of our fathers in Egypt bitter\" (Pes. 10:15). The wine was regarded so necessary an adjunct, that it is ordered that every householder must provide himself with four cups, even if he had to sell or pawn his coat, or hire himself out for a servant, or receive money from the poor's box, in order to do so (Pes. 1). The supper began with drinking the first cup of wine, before which a grace, or thanksgiving, of the following character was said: - \"Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, who hast created the fruit of the vine! Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from among all people, and exalted us from among all languages, and sanctified us with thy commandments! And thou hast given us, in love, the solemn days for joy, and the festivals and appointed seasons for gladness, and this, the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the season of our freedom, a holy convocation, the memorial of our departure from Egypt. For us hast thou chosen; and us hast thou sanctified from among all nations, and thy holy festivals with joy and with gladness hast thou caused us to inherit. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the appointed seasons! Blessed art thou, Lord, King of the universe, who hast preserved us alive, and sustained us, and brought us to this season\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). After drinking the first cup, there followed a general washing of hands, after which the company ate some of the bitter herbs. Then the second cup was filled, and in order to carry out the injunction of Exodus 12:26, 27, the youngest member of the company inquired, \"What mean ye by this service?\" And the president of the feast replied, \"It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.\" At the same time, he explained the purport of the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, and called upon the company to give thanks for what God had wrought for them and for their fathers, ending with Psalm 113, 114, sung by all present. The second cup was then drunk, and after second washing of hands, the unleavened bread was broken, and thanks again given, after which the pieces of bread, the bitter herbs, the other sacrificial dish (if any), and the Paschal lamb were partaken of in turn. The third cup was then filled, thanks were again given, and the cup was drunk. This cup had the name of the \"cup of blessing,\" owing to the blessing said over it, and it was succeeded after an interval by the fourth cup, when Psalm 115-118 (which, with Psalm 113, 114, made up the Hallel) were sung, followed by a prayer of thanksgiving.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 23:6-44NEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Feast of Unleavened Bread was instituted at the same time with the Feast of the Passover (Exodus 12:15-17), and from the beginning the two festivals were practically but one festival, never separated, though separable in idea. The Passover, strictly so called, lasted but one day, Nisan 14; the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted seven days, Nisan 15-21. The whole made a festival of eight days, called indifferently the Feast of the Passover, or the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The bread to be eaten throughout the festival was unleavened, in order to remind the Israelites of the historical fact that on account of the urgency of the Egyptians, \"the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders\" (Exodus 12:34), and quitted the land of their affliction in haste. Accordingly, in the Book of Deuteronomy it is appointed, \"Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the laud of Egypt all the days of thy life\" (Deuteronomy 16:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - The first and the last day were to be days of holy convocation, on which no servile work might be done. It was on the first day, Nisan 15, that our Lord was crucified. The Pharisees found nothing in the holiness of the day to prevent their taking virtual part in his seizure and condemnation and death; but we are told by St. John that \"they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover\" (John 18:28). What is meant in this passage by \"the Passover\" is not the Paschal lamb which had already been consumed, but probably the peace offering, or chagigah, which had to be offered and eaten on the first day of Unleavened Bread. The public sacrifices on each of the seven days of the week were two young bullocks, one ram, and seven Iambs for a burnt offering, with the accompanying meat offerings, and one goat for a sin offering (Numbers 28:19-24). And these were followed by peace offerings made at the discretion of individuals, \"according to the blessing of the Lord which he had given them\" (Deuteronomy 16:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-14. - A second command is given on the subject of the Feast of Unleavened Bread respecting those ceremonies which were only to be made use of when the Israelites had reached Canaan. It has reference to the second day of Unleavened Bread, which is called the morrow after the sabbath, the first day of the feast being meant by the sabbath, on whatever day of week it may have occurred. It was on this second day that the presentation of the first or wave sheaf of barley took place, according to the command, Ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. Which command was fulfilled in the following manner. \"Already, on the 14th of Nisan, the spot whence the first sheaf was to be reaped bad been marked out by delegates from the Sanhedrim, by tying together in bundles, while still standing, the barley that was to be cut down. Though for obvious reasons it was customary to choose for the purpose the sheltered Ashes valley across Kedron, there was no restriction on that point, provided the barley had grown in an ordinary field - of course in Palestine itself - and not in garden or orchard land, and that the soil had not been manured nor yet artificially watered. When the time for cutting the sheaf had arrived, that is, on the evening of the 15th of Nisan (even though it was a sabbath)just as the sun went down, three men, each with a sickle and basket, formally set to work. But in order clearly to bring out all that was distinctive in the ceremony, they first asked of the bystanders three times each of these questions: 'Has the sun gone down?' 'With this sickle?' 'Into this basket?' ' On this sabbath?' (or first Passover day); and lastly, 'Shall I reap?' Having been each time answered in the affirmative, they cut down barley to the amount of one ephah, or ten omers, or three seahs, which is equal to about three pecks and three pints of our English measure. The ears were brought into the court of the temple\" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The sheaf composed of these ears (for the Authorized Version is right in considering that it is the sheaf, and not the omer of flour made out of the ears of barley, that is meant by עֹמֶר, though Josephus and the Mishna take it the other way) was on the following day waved by the priests before the Lord, in token of its consecration, and through it, of the consecration of the whole barley crop to the Lord. With it was offered the burnt offering of a lamb, a meat offering double the usual quantity, and a drink offering. This passage and verses 18 and 37, are the only places in the Book of Leviticus where the drink offering is mentioned. Until the waving of the sheaf, neither bread nor parched corn, nor green ears, that is, no grain in any form, might be eaten. We may imagine how delicacies made of the new flour would at once appear in the streets as soon as the sheaf had been waved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-21. - The Feast of Pentecost lasted but one day. From the morrow after the sabbath - that is, from the second day of Unleavened Bread - the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths, i.e., weeks, were to be counted, making forty-nine days, and on the day following the completion of the seventh sabbath (meaning here the seventh week), the festival was to be held, whence its later name of Pentecost, or Fiftieth-day Feast. It would have fallen about the beginning of June - a season of the year which would have made the journey to Jerusalem easy. The characteristic offering of the day was that of two wave loaves of two tenth deals... of fine flour... baken with leaven. These loaves were regarded as the firstfruits unto the Lord of the wheat harvest, although the greater part of the crop had now been reaped and housed. They were to be leavened and brought out of your habitations; that is, they were to consist of such bread as was ordinarily used in daily life. They were made out of ears of wheat selected and cut like the barley in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then threshed and ground in the temple court. Each loaf contained an omer of flour, amounting to about five pints, and would therefore have weighed about five pounds. With these were offered two lambs, which were waved before the Lord by being led backwards and forwards before the tabernacle or the temple, and then the loaves were waved also, but they were not placed upon the altar, as they were leavened. The twentieth verse, which is somewhat obscure in the Authorized Version, should be punctuated as follows. And the priest shall wave them (the two lambs) with the bread of the firstfruits (the two loaves) for a wave offering before the Lord; with the two lambs they (the loaves) shall be holy to the Lord for the priest. The other sacrifices to be offered on this day are described in the text as seven lambs,... one young bullock, and two rams... for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings,... and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. In the Book of Numbers (Numbers 28:27) they are stated to be \"seven lambs,\" \"two young bullocks,\" \"one ram,\" with meat and drink offerings, and \"one kid of the goats.\" Seeing that in Leviticus one young bullock and two rams are commanded, and in Numbers \"two young bullocks and one ram,\" it is reasonable to suppose that a copyist's error has found its way into one or the other text. The feast was to be kept as a day of holy convocation, and no servile work was to be done upon it. The number of sacrifices offered by individuals who had come to Jerusalem caused the festivity to be in practice continued for several days subsequent to the festival itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - When ye reap the harvest of your land. The legislator pauses in his enunciation of the festivals to add the rule of charity, already laid down in the nineteenth chapter, as to leaving the gleanings unto the poor, and to the stranger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-25 - In the seventh month, in the first day of the month. Only one of the monthly festivals is named in this chapter, because it is the only one on which a holy convocation was to be held. The first day of the seventh month we should expect to be holier than the first day of any other month, on account of the peculiar holiness of the seventh month, and because it was the beginning of the civil year. It is to be a sabbath; that is, a festival observed by rest, and a memorial of blowing of trumpets. The latter words should be rather rendered a memorial of a joyful noise. That these joyful sounds were made by blowing the cornet, we may well believe from the testimony of tradition, but the text of Holy Scripture does not state the fact, and the use of the word trumpets in place of \"cornets\" leads to a confusion. Every new moon, and among them that of the seventh month, was observed by the blowing of trumpets (Numbers 10:10), but the trumpets then blown differed in their use and shape from the cornet. The trumpet was a long-shaped, metal instrument, at first used to give the signal for marching, afterwards to serve as the sign of the arrival of the monthly festival; the cornet was an animal's horn, or, if not a real horn, an instrument formed in the shape of a horn, and it was used to express joyful emotions, answering somewhat to our modern bell-ringing in the West, or firing unloaded guns in the East. Besides the blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices were appointed for the first of each month, \"two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs,\" with their meat and drink offerings, for a burnt offering, and \"one kid of the goats\" for a sin offering (Numbers 28:11-15). On New Year's Day, which, from its difference from the other new moons, was an annual as well as a monthly feast, the special offerings were \"one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs,\" with their meat and drink offerings for a burnt offering, and \"one kid of the goats\" for a sin offering; and these were to be in addition to the offerings made on the first day of each month (Numbers 29:2-6). It became a custom for the Levites to chant at the morning sacrifice Psalm 81, and at the evening sacrifice Psalm 29. The great joyfulness of the day is shown by the account given of its observance in the Book of Nehemiah. It was on the first day of the seventh month that Ezra read the Book of the Law publicly to the people, and when \"the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law,\" Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites said, \"This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep.... Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength. So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them\" (Nehemiah 8:9-12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-32. - The ceremonies to be observed on the day of atonement have been already described in chapter 16, where it found its place as the great purification of the people and of the sanctuary. Here it is reintroduced as one of the holy days. It is the one Jewish fast; to be observed as a day of holy convocation, a day in which to afflict your souls and to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, and in which no manner of work was to be done; inasmuch as, like the weekly sabbath, it was a sabbath of rest from the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even. The time of year at which it was appointed shows that one purpose of its institution was to make solemn preparation for the joyous festival of Tabernacles, which was to follow in five days' time, when the people ought to be in a state of reconciliation with God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-36. - The third of the great festivals, the Feast of Tabernacles - beginning on the 15th of Tisri, as the Feast of Unleavened Bread began on the 15th of Nisan - lasted seven days, and was followed by an octave; on two days, the first day and its octave, there is to be an holy convocation, and on these no servile work is to be done. The eighth day is also a solemn assembly. The meaning of the word atzereth, translated a solemn assembly, is doubtful. It occurs ten times in the Hebrew Scriptures, and appears to signifyNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the last day of a feast (see John 7:37, where mention is made of \"the last day, that great day of the feast\");NEWLINENEWLINE(2) a solemn assembly held on the last day of a feast; whence it comes to meanNEWLINENEWLINE(3) a solemn assembly. The Jews gave the name to the Feast of Pentecost, as being the close of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. On each of the seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles was to be offered an offering made by fire unto the Lord. The sacrifices to be offered are enumerated in Numbers 29:12-38. There were to be sacrificed two rams, and fourteen iambs, and bullocks diminishing by one a day from thirteen on the first day to seven on the last. These formed the burnt sacrifices. The sin offering on each day was one kid of the goats. On the eighth day the burnt offering consisted of one bullock, one ram, seven lambs, and the sin offering, as before, of one kid of the goats. Thus there were offered in all, in the eight days, seventy-one bullocks, fifteen rams, one hundred and five lambs, and eight kids, beside meat and drink offerings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 37, 38. - These verses form the conclusion of the immediate subject.

When ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, not necessarily at the completion of the ingathering, but at the time at which the festival is held, ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees. The word in the Hebrew, in its literal acceptation, means fruits of goodly trees, and hence in later times a misunderstanding arose (see 2 Macc. 10:6, 7), which led to the graceful practice of carrying in the left hand citrons (the fruit of goodly trees), and in the right hand myrtles, palms, and willows. It appears, however, that the word signifies in this place rather products than fruits, namely, leaves and branches. The command, therefore, would be, ye shall take you... products of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brooks. Originally, the purpose of these boughs was to make booths, as is shown by Nehemiah 8:15, 16, \"Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths.\" And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. Accordingly we find when the feast was observed by Ezra, after the long interval from the days of Joshua, \"there was very great gladness\" (Nehemiah 8:17). The reason of the injunction to dwell in booths is that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; that is, on the first night after they had been delivered from Egypt, and encamped at Succoth (Exodus 12:37).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus23:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year.

The oil to be used for the lamps was to be pure oil olive, that is, oil made of picked berries, without any intermixture of dust or twigs; and it was to be beaten instead of \"pressed,\" because when the berries were crushed in the olive-press, small portions of them became mixed with and discoloured the oil, which was, therefore, less pure than when the fruit was simply beaten and then left to drain. The lamps were to burn continually; that is, from evening to morning every night. Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation; that is, in the holy place, as distinct from the holy of holies. Aaron, either personally or by his sons (see Exodus 27:21), was to dress the lamps every morning, and light them every evening (Exodus 30:7). The lamps were upon the seven-branched candlestick, which is called the pure candlestick, because made of gold. The light of the seven-branched candlestick symbolized the enlightening power of the Holy Spirit, which should illumine God's Church (Zechariah 4:2-6; Revelation 1:12, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommand the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWithout the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-9. - The shewbread, or bread of the face, that is, of the presence, was to be made of fine flour, that is, of wheat, and to consist of twelve cakes or loaves, to represent the twelve tribes of Israel, each loaf containing upward of six pounds of flour. The loaves were placed upon the pure table before the Lord; that is, on the golden table of shewbread within the sanctuary - which stood not far from the vail which partitioned off the holy of holies - toward the north, as the candlestick was toward the south. The loaves were set, not, probably, in two rows, six on a row, as they could have hardly stood in that position on so small a table as the table of shewbread (which was only three feet by one foot and a half), but in piles, six in a pile. Upon them, or more probably between the two piles, were placed two vials or cups filled with frankincense (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:07, 6). The shewbread was renewed every sabbath day, with much ceremony. \"Four priests,\" says the Mishna, \"enter, two of them carrying the piles of bread, and two of them the cups of incense. Four priests had gone in before them, two to take off the two old piles of shrewbread, and two to take off the cups of incense. Those who brought in the new stood at the north side facing southwards; those who took away the old, at the south side, facing northwards. One party lifted off and the other put on, the hands of one being over against the hands of the other, as it is written, Thou shalt set upon the table bread of the Passover always before me\" ('Men.,' 11:7). The loaves that were removed were delivered to the priests for their consumption within the tabernacle, the whole quantity amounting to seventy-five pounds of bread per week. It was this bread which, in the pressure of necessity, Abimelech gave to David and his men (1 Samuel 21:4-6). At the same time that the old loaves were changed, the frankincense was burned on the golden altar of incense for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord. There is nothing in Scripture to prove whether the loaves were leavened or unleavened. As being the meat offering of the tabernacle, we should expect them to be unleavened, like the meat offering of the court, but there was a reason why the meat offering of the court should be unleavened, which did not operate in the case of the shewbread. A part of the ordinary meat offering had to be burnt on the altar of burnt sacrifice; therefore it could not be leavened, because no leaven might be burned on the altar; but the shewbread was not burnt on any altar, and consequently it need not for that reason be unleavened. The two Pentecostal loaves, which were offered to the Lord by waving instead of burning, were leavened. The probabilities derived from Scripture appear to be equally strong on either side. Josephus states that they were unleavened ('Ant.,' 3:06, 6; 10, 7).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 24:10-23 The reason why the narrative of the blasphemer's death (verses 10-23) is introduced in its present connection, is simply that it took place at the point of time which followed the promulgation of the last law. It serves, however, to vindicate by a memorable example the principle which is at the foundation of every Mosaic law. \"I am the Lord\" is the often-repeated sanction, whether of a moral law or of a ceremonial regulation. But this bastard Israelite, one of the mixed multitude that had followed in the flight from Egypt (Exodus 12:38), blasphemed the Name of the Lord. If such blasphemy were to go unpunished, the obligation of law was dissolved. For, as Lange has said, \"A community which suffers the reviling of the principle of their community without reaction, is morally fallen to pieces.\" He was brought, therefore, to Moses, and so solemn was the occasion, that Moses reserved the case, for which no provision had yet been made, for the special decision of God. The specific judgment on the man is that he shall die by stoning at the hands of the congregation, after the witnesses of his sin had laid their hands upon his head; and a general law is founded on the special case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The son of an Israelitish woman. This is the only place where the adjective Israelitish is found; and the word \"Israelite\" only occurs in 2 Samuel 17:25. Whose father was an Egyptian. The man could not, therefore, be a member of the congregation, as, according to the subsequently promulgated law (Deuteronomy 23:8), the descendant of an Egyptian could not be admitted till the third generation. He seems to have committed two offenses which led up to his great crime. First, he went out among the children of Israel, that is, he did not confine himself to his own part of the encampment, where the mixed multitude lived, but he intruded into the part set aside for pure Israelites; and next, having thus put himself already in the wrong, this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp. According to Jewish tradition, the cause of quarrel was a claim set up by the Egypto-Israelite to encamp in the Danite quarters, on the ground that his mother was a Danite - a claim which he insisted on enforcing, although the judges gave a decision against him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the LORD, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - In the course of the straggle the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. The word nakav is here rightly translated blasphemeth (cf. verses 14, 16, 23), but the words of the Lord should be omitted, as they are not found in the original, and are not required. The LXX. have rendered nakav by a word meaning pronounced, and on this misunderstanding, adopted by the Jews, has been founded the Jewish precept forbidding the utterance of the Divine Name. Owing to that prohibition, the true pronunciation of the word written and called \"Jehovah\" has been lost. Wherever the Name occurred in Scripture, that of Adoring, meaning Lord, was substituted for it in public reading, the consonants only of the original name, Y H V H, being preserved in the written text, and the vowels of Adonai, namely a o a, being written underneath them in lieu of the original vowels. From the consonants Y H Y H and the vowels a o a would be formed Yahovah or Jahovah, but the laws of the Hebrew language required the first a to be changed into e, and hence the name Jehovah. It is almost certain that the original vowels were a and e, which would form the name Yahveh, the Samaritans having always so pronounced it, according to the testimony of Theodoret. It is said that the high priest continued to utter the very name Yahveh on the Day of Atonement long after it had ceased to be used in the reading of the Scriptures, and that when he did so, those who heard it prostrated themselves, saying, \"Blessed be the Name!\" After a time, however, he ceased to pronounce it aloud on that day also, lest it should be learnt and used for magical purposes. In consequence, perhaps, of the substitution of Adonai for Yahveh, the Septuagint version always reads for Yahveh, Κύριος: and the English version the LORD. In French and other versions the name is represented by the Eternal, and it has been proposed to substitute the latter rendering for the Loud in our own version. But it is more than doubtful whether we should then come nearer to the true sense of the original Yahveh, although at first sight it appears that this would be the case. For the word Yahveh is part of the causative form of the verb havah, or hayah, to be; but this verb is not used to express unchangeable or absolute existence, but rather an occurrence: its causative form, therefore, would signify that which brings about events; and the substantive derived from that causative form would signify, not one that eternally exists, but one that providentially governs. For an induction of instances for the further proof of the above meaning of the word Yahveh, we refer the reader to Sir William Martin's essay 'On the Divine Name' ('Semitic Languages,' part 2), from which we transcribe the concluding paragraph. \"This view of the Divine Name, to which we are led by the evidence of the Hebrew language itself, is in full conformity with the general religious teaching of the Old Testament, which is practical and moral; setting forth in form readily intelligible, the character of God in his relations to man. It does not concern itself with those problems which philosophy has ever been seeking to solve. It addresses itself to human needs and human duties, and not to abstract inquiries. Not that the highest abstract truths were unknown or untaught. Lawgiver and prophet and psalmist set before the people the greatness and the eternity of God in language most clear and impressive. Yet the Name whereby he was put before them as the object of their daily worship, was not one which would exalt him to the utmost above the frail and changeful and transitory lives of his worshippers, and thereby remove him far away from them into the height of a Being beyond man's search or comprehension; but rather a Name which should bring him nigh to them, as One ever mindful of them, ever carrying forward his great purpose for their good, working for their deliverance in every time of need; as One 'whose providence ordereth all things in heaven and on earth.' If this Name did convey to the mind of a Hebrew hearer the thought above expressed, it follows that the old rendering Adonai, Κύριος, or Lord, is to be preferred to that which has of late been substituted for it.\" And they brought the blasphemer unto Moses. This was in accordance with the counsel of Jethro, accepted by Moses (Exodus 18:13-26): \"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge:... and they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And they put him in ward. The same course was followed in the case of the man found gathering sticks upon the sabbath day: \"And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him\" (Numbers 15:34). The same penalty was awarded in both cases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; - lest the camp should become polluted by his death - and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head. The ceremony of laying on of hands in all cases set apart the person or thing on whom or on which they were laid for some special purpose. Its further signification was determined by the particular circumstances of the case. Here it probably returned back on the head of the blasphemer the guilt which otherwise would have adhered to the witnesses from the fact of their hearing his blasphemy, and appearing to acquiesce in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - In accordance with the judicial decision on the man is framed the general law against blasphemy and its penalty. It runs as follows: Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him. It has been questioned whether two offenses or one are here contemplated, whether cursing his God is one offense, bearing his sin being its punishment, and blaspheming the Name of the Lord another and greater offense, for which the punishment is stoning; or whether the latter offense and punishment are a more specific statement of the offense and punishment which had only generally been described before. Those who take the first view point out that the present offender was an Egyptian, and urge that had he cursed his God, that is, the Egyptian god or gods, he would only have had to bear his sin; but that as he had blasphemed the Name of Israel's God, Jehovah, he was to be stoned. The second explanation, however, is the truer one. The Scriptures recognize but one God, and he is the Lord Jehovah. Whoever curses him shall bear his sin, that is, shall be guilty in such a way that his sin must be purged either by punishment or by sacrifice, and it is then further declared that this particular sin can be purged only by the death of the offender at the hand of the congregation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In close connection with the command to slay the blasphemer is repeated the prohibition of murder, and the injunction that the murderer shall surely be put to death. Thus a distinction is sharply drawn between the judicial sentence carried out by the congregation, and the unsanctioned smiting the life of a man by another, and a warning is given against any man fanatically taking the law into his own hands, even in the case of a blasphemer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-21. - A summary of the law respecting minor injuries is added to that respecting murder.

And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The penalty is inflicted on the offender solemnly as an act of the Law, not of mob fury. So it was by a judicial or semi-judicial proceeding that St. Stephen was stoned: \"They brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the Law\" (Acts 6:12, 13). And in spite of the violence exhibited, there was still some form of law, according to Jewish practice, observed in his stoning (Acts 7:58). In the case of our Lord, on the other hand. when they regarded him as guilty of blasphemy on his saying, \"Before Abraham was, I am\" (John 8:58), and \"I and my Father are one\" (John 10:30), the Jews \"took up stones to cast at him,\" not waiting for a judicial condemnation, but, as they supposed, taking the law into their own hands. Had his death been by Jewish hands, it would at the last have been by stoning under this law. But the power of life and death had been taken away from the Jews by the Romans, \"that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die\" (John 18:32).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai. The purpose of the words, in Mount Sinai, is not to distinguish the place in which the sabbatical law and the law of the jubilee were given from that in which the preceding laws were delivered. The words mean only, \"in the Sinai district;\" and they are employed because these laws form the conclusion of the series of laws given while the people were en-camped under Mount Sinai. The law on vows is, it is true, added to them, but it is by way of appendix.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-7. - The sabbath of the seventh year could only be observed when ye come into the land which I give you. The habit of making no distraction in the seventh year during the whole of the life in the wilderness may have led to the neglect of the law after the settlement in Canaan. Another excuse for the neglect may have been a difficulty which would have presented itself of fixing the date from which to count up to the seventh year, as different parts of the land were conquered at different times. According to the law, from New Year's Day of the seventh year (the 1st of Tisri, which occurred about the middle of September) to the following New Year's Day, there was to be neither sowing nor pruning, reaping or gathering. The expression, Neither shalt thou gather the grapes of thy vine undressed, would be more literally rendered, the grapes of thy Nazarite vine, the vine with its unpruned tendrils, being likened to the Nazarite with his unshorn locks. As to sowing and reaping, an exception was made with respect to the barley sown and reaped for the Passover sheaf, and the wheat sown and reaped for the Pentecost loaves. The spontaneous fruits of the earth, and they were very large in the rich fields of the valleys and plains, were to be the property of all alike, whether the owners of the land or not, \"that the poor of thy people might eat\" (Exodus 23:11). And what was left by man was to be food for the cattle and beasts of the field. The cessation of agricultural labours must have served, and may have been intended to serve, as an encouragement to mercantile pursuits, as well as to the study of the Divine Law (Deuteronomy 31:10-13). The Feast of Tabernacles of the seventh year was specially appointed by Moses as a day for reading the Law to the assembled people (Deuteronomy 31:10-13). And the Mishna appoints the following passages of Deuteronomy to be read on that day: - Deuteronomy 1:1-6; Deuteronomy 6:4-8; Deuteronomy 11:13-22; Deuteronomy 14:22; Deuteronomy 15:23; Deuteronomy 17:14; Deuteronomy 26:12-19; Deuteronomy 27, 28. ('Mish. Sotah.,' 7:8). The other ordinance connected with the sabbatical year, the release of debts to the poor (Deuteronomy 15:1-6), was, like the fifth commandment, made of none effect by rabbinical traditions - notably by one which required a debtor, when his creditor said, \"I remit,\" to insist that nevertheless he should accept payment. The moral purpose of the sabbath of the seventh year is well drawn out by Keil: - \"In the sabbatical year the land which the Lord had given his people was to observe a period of holy rest and refreshment to its Lord and God, just as the congregation did on the sabbath day; and the hand of man was to be withheld from the fields and fruit gardens from working them that they might yield their produce for his use. The earth was to be sacred from the hand of man, exhausting its power for earthly purposes as his own property, and to enjoy the holy rest with which God had blessed the earth and all its productions after the Creation. From this, Israel, as the nation of God, was to learn, on the one hand, that although the earth was created for man, it was not merely created for him to draw out its power for his own use, but also to be holy to the Lord and participate in the blessed rest; and on the other hand, that the great purpose for which the congregation of the Lord existed did not consist in the uninterrupted tilling of the earth, connected with bitter labour in the sweat of the brow (Genesis 3:17, 19), but in the peaceful enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, which the Lord their God had given them and would give them still, without the labour of their hands, if they strove to keep his covenant and satisfy themselves with his grace.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The word jubile (as it is always spelt in the Authorized Version) is taken from the Hebrew word yovel, and it came to mean a year of liberty (Ezekiel 46:17; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:12, 3), because it freed men and lands from the obligations to which they would otherwise have been liable; but originally it signified no more than a cornet-blast, and thence the year of the cornet-blast. The way to find the jubilee year was to number seven sabbaths of years, that is, seven weeks of years (chapter 22:15), seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years: then by a blast of the cornet (the word is inexactly rendered trumpet) on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement, the approach of the jubilee in the following year was announced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This verse contains a short statement of the two purposes of the jubilee:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) to proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) ye shall return every man unto his possession.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - So far as the tillage of the land went, the jubilee year was to have the same effect as a sabbatical year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-17. - The Israelites were only tenants of God. They might regard themselves as owners for fifty years, but at the end of every fifty years the land was to come back to him to whom the Lord had assigned it, or to his representative. It might be bought and sold on that understanding, the value of the purchase being four. d by reckoning the price of the harvests up to the next jubilee day; but in this period only \"the years of the fruits\" were to be counted, that is, the sabbatical years, in which there would be no harvests, were to be deducted. Ye shall not therefore oppress (or overreach) one another by demanding more for the hind than would be its just value under the limitation of the jubilee law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-22. - \"Not only the year of jubilee, but the sabbatical year also, commenced in the autumn, when the farmers first began to sow for the coming year; so that the sowing was suspended from the autumn of the sixth year till the autumn of the seventh, and even till the autumn of the eighth whenever the jubilee year came round, in which case both sowing and reaping were omitted for two years in succession, and consequently the produce of the sixth year, which was harvested in the seventh month of that year, must have sufficed for three years, not merely till the sowing in the autumn of the eighth or fiftieth year, but till the harvest of the ninth or fifty-first year, as the Talmud and rabbins of every age have understood the law\" (Keil). The question, What shall we eat? would present itself with double force when the sabbatical and the jubilee years came together. It and the answer to it therefore properly follow on the institution of the jubilee, instead of preceding it, as Ewald, Knobcl, and others demand that it should do.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - For the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. Many incidental advantages, if some difficulties, arose from the jubilee law (which will be the more appreciated if we compare the evils resulting from slavery and the accumulation of land in a few hands, found in the history of Rome or any other ancient nation); but its essential features, so far as the land was concerned, was its inculcation of the lesson of the proprietorship of the Lord. Palestine was God's land: he divided it once for all in the time of Joshua among his people, and every fifty years he required that recourse should be had to that original division, in order that in each generation the people might feel themselves to be his tenants, not independent owners, possessores, not domini.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-28. - The right of redemption of land sold continued always alive, and might be exercised by the original owner or his kinsman. If not exercised, the owner returned into his possession at any rate in the jubilee year. If a man had to sell his land, he was bound to offer it to his nearest kinsman first (see Jeremiah 32:7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-31. - Houses in walled cities are not subject to the law of restoration at the jubilee, as that law applies only to lands and to men; but houses in the country are subject to the law, as they are regarded only as appurtenances of the land. Houses in cities, being occupied by artisans and built by human industry, not originally assigned in the territorial division, are not considered in so strict a sense the property of the Lord as the soil is, and may be parted with more readily. Yet the owners, if obliged to part with them, are allowed a year's grace, during which they are to have the right of buying them back. The expression, within a full year, would be more literally rendered during a fixed time, that fixed time having just before been declared to be a year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32-34. - The houses of the Levites are, by an exception, subject to the law of jubilee. They constituted the share of the national property which was assigned to the tribe of Levi, and so far stood in the same relation to them as the land did to the other tribes. They therefore returned to the original possessor or his representative in the year of jubilee, and might at any earlier time be redeemed. The words, Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, should rather be rendered, But in respect to the cities of the Levites. There is a difficulty also as to the translation of the clause, And if a man purchase of the Levites, for the word rendered purchase menus elsewhere redeem; but here the Authorized Version would seem to be correct. The sense that it gives is that if any one bought a house of the Levites, he had to render it back in the year of jubilee, just as though it had been land. On the other hand, the land belonging to the Levites, in the suburbs of the Levitical cities, which was used for the pasturage of the flocks of the Levites, could not be sold except to a Levite, and therefore no question between the Levites and members of the other tribes could arise regarding it. The phrase, the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, must be understood, by a hendiadys, to mean, the house that was sold in the city of his possession (see Gesenius, 'Lex.,' s.v. לְ i.b.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-38. - Slavery. It is presumed that no Hebrew will become a slave except on the pressure of poverty, and this poverty his brethren are commanded to relieve; but foreseeing that either want of charity on the part of the rich or unthrift on the part of the poor would certainly bring about slavery, the legislator makes regulations so as to soften its character as far as possible. The literal translation of verse 35 is as follows: If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth by thee, thou shalt lay hold of him; a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee. The translation of the latter clause adopted by the Authorized Version, yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee, makes the duty of giving charitable support and loans of money to apply to the case of the stranger and sojourner as well as of the Israelite. The other and more probable rendering confines its application to native Israelites. If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth, thou shalt support him as a stranger or a sojourner, that is, treat him with the forbearance shown to resident foreigners, to whose state he had reduced himself by the loss of his land. The command in verse 36, Take thou no usury of him, or increase, does not bear upon the general question of taking interest for money when lent to wealthy men or companies for business purposes. It simply forbids the taking of interest or increase of a brother Israelite who had become poor. The history of Rome shows how much cruelty and revolution such an injunction may have prevented. The words, or increase, added to usury, forbid the exaction of any greater quantity of food or clothing (a method of evading the law against usury) than that which had been lent. The injunction was transgressed in the time of Nehemiah, when \"he rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.... Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer\" (Nehemiah 5:7, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 39-42. - We see the way in which a poor Israelite might become a slave in the case of the sons of the widow whose oil was multiplied by Elisha. \"Thy servant my husband is dead; (and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord:) and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen\" (2 Kings 4:1). And in the time of Nehemiah, \"Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.... And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards\" (Nehemiah 5:3-5). But the fact that an Israelite could not be kept in slavery for more than six years (Exodus 21:2), and that the period of his service had to be still shorter if the jubilee fell before the seventh year, and the further fact that at the time of the jubilee he would not only he free, but recover any ancestral property that he had forfeited, so that he might become once more on an equality with his master, would have made his position totally different from the hopeless, helpless state of the Greek or Roman slave, even without the positive command that he was to be treated, not as a bondservant: but as an hired servant, and as a sojourner. All alike, master and bondsman, were the slaves of God, and therefore not only were they, so far, on an equality one with another, but the master would be encroaching on the right of God if he claimed God's slaves for his own inalienably.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God, is paralleled by the New Testament injunction, \"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him\" (Ephesians 6:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBoth thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 44-46. - Slavery is not forbidden in respect to non-Israelites. The world was not yet ready for it, as it was not ready in the days of St. Paul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 47-55. - Rules are laid down for the case of an Israelite who has sold himself for a slave to a non-Israelite. In this case he is not set free at the end of six years, as he would be if his master were a countryman, but in other respects his treatment is to be like that of the man with an Israelite master. He may be redeemed by the value of his work down to the jubilee being paid by himself or his kinsman; he is to be set free when the jubilee comes at any rate; he is to be treated kindly while continuing in his master's service, and his countrymen are to see that no over-severity is used.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEither his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus25:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it. The word idols (elilim) means the \"nothings\" which the heathen substituted for the Lord God. The graven image (here meaning a carved wooden image), the standing image (meaning a sacred pillar), and the image of stone (that is, a sculptured stone idol), are the three forms of images under which adoration was paid, whether to the true God or to a false doily. The expression, to bow down unto (or towards) it, forbids worshipping before an image as well as worshipping an image.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.

In Leviticus we find, Then I will give you rain in due season; in Ezekiel, \"And I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.\" In Leviticus, And the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit; in Ezekiel, \"And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth her increase.\" In Leviticus, Ye shall dwell in your land safely; in Ezekiel, \"They shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.\" In Leviticus, And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land; in Ezekiel, \"And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land.... And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.\" The promise, Your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time, is similar to that in the prophet Amos, \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed\" (Amos 9:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And five of you shall chase an hundred.

This was fulfilled, spiritually, as shown to St. John in his vision of the new Jerusalem: \"I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God\" (Revelation 21:3). And my soul shall not abhor you. The result of God's abhorrence being his rejection of those whom he abhors (see Leviticus 20:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.

This expression, used also in the parallel passage of Ezekiel above referred to (Ezekiel 34:27), and Jeremiah 27:2 receives an illustration from the ancient method of harnessing oxen, still kept up in the East and South. The band means the straight piece of wood laid across the necks of the oxen, by which their heads are fastened together to keep them level with each other, and by which they are attached to the pole of the wagon.

So in the case of the Assyrians transported to Palestine, \"At the beginning of their dwelling there, they feared not the Lord: therefore the Lord sent lions among them, which slew some of them\" (2 Kings 17:25) - and your high ways shall be desolate.

I will bring a sword upon yon, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant:... I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy - that is, ye shall go into captivity... and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. Cf. Ezekiel 5:12, \"A third part of thee shall die with pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.\" The famine that is to come upon them is described as making ten women bake bread in one oven, - whereas in ordinary times one oven was only sufficient for one woman's baking - and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight; that is, the quantity baked will have to be weighed out in rations, before any one is allowed to take it. See 2 Kings 6:25; Isaiah 3:1; Jeremiah 14:18; and as illustrative of the last point, Ezekiel 4:16, \"Behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-33. - Punishment in the fifth degree. Ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. We find that this threat was fulfilled in Samaria (2 Kings 6:28), and in Jerusalem at the time both of the earlier siege by the Chaldaeans, and of the later siege by the Romans (see Lamentations 2:20; Lamentations 4:10; Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:09, 3; and the terrible case of Mary daughter of Eleazar. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.' 6:03, 4). And I will destroy your high places. By high places is meant the tops of hills or eminences chosen for worship, whether of Jehovah (see Judges 6:26; 1 Kings 3:2; 2 Kings 12:3; 1 Chronicles 21:26), or of false gods. The high places intended here are the spots where the \"sun-images\" were erected (see 2 Chronicles 14:5; Isaiah 17:8; Ezekiel 6:4) - and cut down your images, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols - that is, they should roll in the dust together. And I will make your cities waste - as Samaria and Jerusalem - and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, - by the sanctuaries, which are to be desolated, is meant all the consecrated things: the holy of holies, the holy place, the court, the ark, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt sacrifice - and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours - so in Jeremiah 6:20, \"To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet\" (cf. Isaiah 1:11-15). And I will bring the land into desolation (cf. Jeremiah 9:11): and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it (cf. Ezekiel 5:15). And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you. See Jeremiah 9:16, \"I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - The land had not participated in the sins of its inhabitants. The latter had thought that, by the neglect of the sabbatical years, they had enriched themselves by the fruits of those years which would otherwise have been wasted. The result was that they lost the land altogether for a period equal to that during which it ought to have kept sabbath, and the land \"as long as she lay desolate kept sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years\" (2 Chronicles 36:21). From the entrance into the holy land until the Babylonish Captivity there elapsed eight hundred and sixty-three years, in which time there ought to have been kept one hundred and twenty-three sabbatical years. As only seventy are made up by the duration of the Captivity, it may be concluded that fifty-three sabbatical years were observed by the Israelites; but this conclusion is very doubtful. It is more likely that seventy, being a multiple of the sacred number seven, was regarded as sufficient to purge all previous neglects, whatever they might have been.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36-39. - The final punishment. Upon them that are left, that is, the surviving captives and exiles, I will send a faintness into their hearts, - so Ezekiel 21:7, \"And every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water\" -... and the sound of a shaken (or driven) leaf shall chase them;... and they shall fall,... and ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands. This is the concluding threat. It is conditional in its nature, and the condition having been fulfilled, we may say with reverence that it has been accomplished. Those of the ten tribes who did not find their way to Babylon, and so became absorbed in the body which returned to Jerusalem, have been eaten up by the land of their enemies, and have pined away in their enemies' lands. Neither they nor their descendants are to be found in any part of the globe, however much investigation may employ itself in searching for them. They have been absorbed by the populations among which they were scattered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 40-45. - God's pardon will, even yet, as always, follow upon confession of sin and genuine repentance. They must recognize not only that they have sinned, but that their sufferings have been a punishment for those sins at God's hand. This will work in them humble acquiescence in God's doings, and then he will remember his covenant with Jacob, and also his covenant with Isaac, and also his covenant with Abraham, and for the sake of the covenant of their ancestors, he will not east them away, neither will he abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break his covenant with them. Whether Jewish repentance has been or ever will be so full as to obtain this blessing, cannot be decided now. Perhaps it may be the case that all the blessings promised by Moses and by future prophets to repentant and restored Israel are to find their accomplishment in the spiritual Israel, the children of Abraham who is \"the father of all them that believe\" (Romans 4:11), seeing that \"God is able of stones to raise up children unto Abraham\" (Matthew 3:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus26:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - This is the closing paragraph of the Book of Leviticus; to which another chapter has been added, in the form of an appendix, on the subject of vows.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINELeviticus 27:1NEWLINENEWLINEAPPENDIX.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 27. The final chapter, attached to the book after the concluding exhortation, is a short treatise on persons (verses 2-8), animals (verses 9-13), houses (verses 14, 15), lauds (verses 16-24), vowed to God; and on the commutation of vows. A man might vow to the service of God whatever he had a right over, that is, himself, his wife, his children, his slaves, his beasts, his houses, his fields. In case persons were vowed, the rule was that they should be redeemed at a certain price, though occasionally the redemption was not made. Vowing a person to God thus, was, as a rule, no more than vowing so much money to the use of the sanctuary as was fixed as the price of the redemption of the person vowed. Yet there is a great difference between the two acts of vowing a person and vowing the correlative sum of money. A man in great danger or distress might devote himself (Genesis 28:20) or another (Judges 11:30; 1 Samuel 1:11) to God, when he never would have vowed money. Such vows were redeemable, and, as a rule, were redeemed, though there were some exceptions, as in the case of Samuel. If beasts were vowed to the Lord (verses 9-13), they could not be redeemed if they were such as could be sacrificed to him; if they were not such as could be sacrificed, they were to be valued by the priest, and either retained as a possession of the sanctuary, or, if the owner preferred it, redeemed by him at the price fixed and out-fifth additional. If houses were vowed to the Lord (verses 14, 15), they became the property of the sanctuary, unless they were redeemed at the valuation set upon them by the priest, with one-fifth additional. If hereditary lands were vowed to the Lord (verses 16-21), they became the possession of the sanctuary at the year of jubilee, unless they had been previously redeemed; redemption, however, was in this case the ordinary rule, and we do not hear of any accumulation of landed property in the hands of the priests from this source. In the case of a field which was not an hereditary possession, but a purchase, being vowed to the Lord (verses 22-24), the commutation sum was paid down \"in that day,\" that is, on the spot in a lump sum, the land going back at the jubilee to the original owners from whom the temporary possession had been bought by the man who made the vow. A section is added forbidding the firstborn of animals, things devoted, and tithes to be vowed, because they were already the Lord's; allowing the redemption of the firstborn of unclean animals, and of the tithes of corn and fruits, but prohibiting redemption in the case of sacrificial animals, of things devoted, and of the tithes of animals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When a man shall make a singular vow, - literally, when a man shall separate a vow, that is, make a special vow (see Numbers 6:2) - the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation; that is, when a man has vowed himself or another person to the Lord, the priest shall declare the amount at which the person vowed is to be redeemed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-7. - The sum at which a man between twenty and sixty years of age was to be redeemed was fifty shekels, equal to £6 9s. 2d.; a woman, thirty shekels, or £3 17s. 6d.; a youth between five and twenty years of age, twenty shekels, or £2 11s. 8d.; a maiden between the same ages, ten shekels, or £1 5s. 10d.; a boy between one month and five years, five shekels, or 12s. 11d.; a girl between the same ages, three shekels, or 7s. 9d.; a man above sixty years, fifteen shekels, or £1 18s. 9d.; a woman of the same age, ten shekels, or £1 5s. 10d.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - A discretion is left with the priest to lower these valuations in case the man who has made the vow is very poor. According to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - In case a clean animal is vowed to the Lord, it is not to be exchanged for another on the plea of not being good enough or being too good for sacrifice. If any such attempt is made, both animals are to be given up and sacrificed, or, if blemished, added to the herd of the sanctuary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - An unclean animal, which might not be sacrificed, if vowed, was to be valued at a price fixed by the priest. If its original owner took it back again, he was to pay this price and one-fifth more than the sum named; if he did not, it became the property of the sanctuary. The words, the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad, should rather be rendered, the priest shall estimate it between good and bad, that is, at a moderate price, as though it were neither very good nor very bad. And so in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - The rule as to the redemption of houses is the same as that regarding the redemption of unclean animals. The ordinary practice was to redeem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-21. - In case a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of his possession, that is, of his hereditary lands, the redemption price is fixed by the quantity of seed required for sowing it. If it requires a homer, or five bushels and a half, of barley seed to crop it, the redemption price is fifty shekels, or £6 9s. 2d., plus one-fifth, that is, £7 15s., supposing that the vow had been made in the year succeeding the jubilee; but if the vow was made at any time after the jubile, the value of the previous harvests was deducted from this sum. The amount does not seem to have been paid in a lump sum, but by annual installments of one shekel and one-fifth of a shekel, equal to 3s. 1 1/5 d., each year. In case he had sold his interest in the field up to the approaching jubilee before making his vow, then no redemption was allowed; he paid nothing, but the field passed from him to the sanctuary at the jubilee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-24. - The case of a man who shall sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession, or inheritance, is necessarily different, because he was not the owner of the land, but only the possessor of it until the next jubilee. For this reason he had to pay the redemption price immediately in that day, the land, of course, reverting to the original owner at the jubilee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The estimation is to be made according to the shekel of the sanctuary, that is, the shekel at its full value, before worn by use in traffic (see Exodus 30:13; Numbers 3:47; Numbers 18:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD'S.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-33. - The law of vows and their commutation is further declared in four subjects:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the firstborn of animals;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) things already devoted;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) tithes of the produce of the land;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) tithes of the produce of the cattle. Verses 26-28. - The firstborn of animals were already the Lord's, and they could not, therefore, be vowed to him afresh; the sacrificial animals were to be offered in sacrifice (Exodus 13:15); the ass was to be redeemed by a sheep or be put to death (Exodus 13:13; Exodus 34:20); other unclean animals are to be either redeemed at the fixed price, plus one-fifth, or, if not redeemed, sold for the benefit of the sanctuary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28, 29. - Whatever is already cherem (a word here first used as a term well understood), that is, devoted to God, whether devoted for the purpose of destruction or of entire surrender to him, may be neither redeemed nor sold. Whether it be of man, like the Canaanites at Hormah (Numbers 21:2), or of beast, as the sheep and oxen of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15:21), or of the field, as referred to in verse 21, or of other inanimate objects, as the cities of Hormah (Numbers 21:2), it is either to be put to death or given up without reserve or commutation to God's ministers. In the case of men they must be put to death. \"This provision would have applied only to the devoting of those who were already manifestly under the ban of Jehovah those guilty of such outrageous and flagrant violation of the fundamental law of the covenant that they manifestly came under the penalty of death. Such persons, instead of being tried and condemned, might be at once devoted and put to death\" (Gardiner). \"To this it may be added that the devotion by ban (cherem) of any object or person was not to be done by private persons, at their own will, but was performed by the civil magistrates, under known conditions and laws; e.g. the cities of idolaters, such as Jericho, were so devoted, and the inhabitants, by the command of God himself, who made his people to be the executioners of his judgments against inveterate idolatry (see Deuteronomy 13:13; Joshua 6:17)\" (Wordsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNone devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-32. - Tithes, like the cherem, are introduced as things well known. Abraham gave tithes to Melchizedek (Genesis 14:20; Hebrews 7:4). Jacob vowed the tenth to the Lord (Genesis 28:22), whence we see that the practice of the payment of tithes was not of Mosaic institution, but immemorial. The duty was, however, commanded afresh for the Israelites. \"I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle\" (Numbers 18:21), and of this tithe they were to pay a tenth to the priests (Numbers 18:26). Being already the Lord's, the tithe of the corn and fruits could not be vowed to the Lord, but it could be redeemed, or commuted, by the owner paying one-fifth more than the price at which it was valued.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - The tithe of the cattle could neither be vowed nor redeemed. As the young oxen and sheep passed under the rod by which they were counted by the herdsman, the tenth animal was touched (the rod, according to tradition, having been dipped in red paint), and handed over to the Levites. There was to be no change made in the animals, nor was commutation allowed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus27:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The final verse of the previous chapter is repeated after the further legislation on vows and on their commutation has been added, to show that it too makes part of the Sinaitic code.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord. The word used in the original for \"meat offering\" (minchah), means, like its Greek equivalent, δῶρον, a gift made by an inferior to a superior. Thus the sacrifices of Cain and Abel were their \"minchah\" to God (Genesis 4:3, 4), the present sent to Esau by Jacob was his \"minchah\" (Genesis 32:13), and the present to Joseph was his brethren's \"minchah\" (Genesis 43:11). It is therefore equivalent to a gift of homage, which recognizes the superiority of him to whom it is offered, and ceremonially promises loyal obedience to him. Owing to its use in this passage, it came gradually to be confined in its signification to vegetable gifts, - unbloody sacrifices, as they are called sometimes, in contrast to animal sacrifices - while the word \"corban\" crone to be used in the wider acceptation which once belonged to \"minchah.\" The conditions to be fulfilled by the Israelite who offered a meat offering were the following.NEWLINENEWLINE1. He must offer eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) uncooked flour, with oil, salt, and frankincense, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) flour made into an unleavened cake (whether of the nature of biscuit or pancake), with oil, salt, and frankincense; orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) roasted grains, with oil, salt, and frankincense.NEWLINENEWLINE2. He must bring his offering to the court of the tabernacle, and give to the priests at least as much as one omer (that is, nearly a gallon), and not more than sixty-one omers. The priest receiving it from him must:NEWLINENEWLINE1. Take a handful of the flour, oil, and salt, or a proportionate part of the cake (each omer generally made ten cakes) in place of the flour, and burn it with all the frankincense as a memorial upon the altar of burnt offering.NEWLINENEWLINE2. With his brother priests he must eat the remainder within the precincts of the tabernacle. Here the essentials of the sacrifice are the presentation made by the offerer, and the burning of the memorial on the altar, followed by the consumption of the remainder by the priests. The moral lesson taught to the Israelite completed that of the burnt offering. As the burnt offering taught self-surrender, so the meat offering taught recognition of God's supremacy and submission to it, the first by the surrender of a living creature substituted for the offerer, the second by the gift of a part of the good things bestowed by God on man for the preservation of life which, being given back to God, serve as a recognition of his supremacy. Spiritually the lesson taught the Jew was that of the necessity of a loyal service to God; and mystically he may have learnt a lessonNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as to the force of prayer rising up to heaven as the incense which had to be offered with each form of the meat offering;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) as to the need of purity and incorruption, symbolized by the prohibition of leaven and honey, and the command to use salt. The supplemental character of the meat offering accounts for the order in which it here stands, not arbitrarily interposed between two animal sacrifices, but naturally following on the burnt offering, as an adjunct to it and the complement of its teaching. So close was the union between the two sacrifices, that the burnt offering was never offered without the accompaniment of the meat offering (Numbers 15:4). It has been also maintained that the meat offering, like the drink offering, was never made independently of the animal sacrifice; but this cannot be proved. On the contrary, the manner in which laws regulating it are here laid down, lead to the inference that it might be offered, when any willed it, by itself. The close connection between the sacrifice of an animal and the offering of cakes of flour, and of wine, is noticeable in heathen sacrifices likewise. The very word, immolare, translated \"to sacrifice,\" is derived from the mola or salt-cake offered with the animal; and the other word ordinarily used in Latin for \"sacrifice,\" that is, mactare, is derived from the victim being enriched (magis auctus) with the libation of wine. Thus we see that the offering of the fruits of the earth was regarded, elsewhere as well as in Judaea, as the natural concomitant of an animal sacrifice, and not only that, but as so essential a part of the latter as to have given a name to the whole ceremony, and not only to the whole ceremony, but to the specific act of the slaughter of the victim. The thought of the heathen in offering the fruits of the earth was probably not much different from that of the Israelites. It was his gift to the superhuman power, to which he thus acknowledged that he owed submission. We may further notice that salt was enjoined in the heathen as in the Jewish sacrifices as indispensable. Pliny says that the importance of salt is seen especially in sacrifices, none of which are completed without the salt-cake ('Hist. Nat.,' 31, 7) The now obsolete use of the word \"meat\" in the sense of \"food,\" in contrast to \"flesh,\" creates some confusion of thought. \"Fruit offering\" would be a better title, were it not that the signification of \"fruit\" is going through a similar change to that which \"meat\" has undergone. \"Flour offering\" might be used, but an alteration in the rendering is not imperative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He shall take there out his handful. This was the task of the priest. The handful that he took and burnt upon the altar has the technical and significative name of the memorial. It acted as a memorial before God, in the same way as Cornelius's prayers and alms - \"Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God\" (Acts 10:4) - being something which should cause God to think graciously of the offerer. The frankincense is not mixed with the flour and the oil and the salt, as a constituent element of the offering, but is placed upon them, and is all of it burnt in \"the memorial,\" symbolizing the need of adding prayer to sacrifice, that the latter may be acceptable to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. The meat offerings must have gone far to supply the priests with farinaceous food, as, for every handful of flour burnt on the altar, nearly a gallon went to the priests. They had to eat it within the precincts of the tabernacle, as was the case with all meats that were most holy, viz. the minchahs, the shew-bread, and the flesh of the sin offering and of the trespass offering (Leviticus 10:12). Other meats assigned to the priests might be eaten in any clean place (Leviticus 10:14). The priests' own meat offerings were wholly burnt (Leviticus 6:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-11. - The second form of meat offering, when the flour and oil were made up into four varieties of cakes. The ritual of offering is not different from that of the first form. The frankincense is not mentioned, but doubtless is understood. The rabbinical rule, that meat offerings, when following upon burnt offerings or peace offerings, had no frankincense burnt with them, rests on no solid foundation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - Ye shall burn no leaven nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire. Leaven and honey are not forbidden to be offered to the Lord; on the contrary, in the next verse they are commanded to be offered. The prohibition only extends to their being burnt on the altar, owing, no doubt, to the effect of fire upon them in making them swell and froth, thus creating a repulsive appearance which, as we shall see, throughout the Mosaic legislation, represents moral evil. The firstfruits of honey are to be offered (cf. Exodus 22:29), and leaven is to be used in the two wave loaves offered at the Feast of Pentecost as firstfruits (Leviticus 23:17). the words translated, As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord, should be rendered, As an oblation of firstfruits ye shall offer them (that is, leaven and honey), but they shall not be burnt on the altar. The mark in A.V. denoting a new paragraph at the beginning of verse 12, should be removed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt. Salt is commanded as symbolizing in things spiritual, because preserving in things physical, incorruption (cf. Matthew 5:13; Mark 9:49; Luke 14:34; Colossians 4:6). It is an emblem of an established and enduring covenant, such as God's covenant with his people, which is never to wax old and be destroyed, and it is therefore termed the salt of the covenant of thy God. Hence \"a covenant of salt\" came to mean a covenant that should not be broken (Numbers 18:19; 2 Chronicles 13:5). The use of salt is not confined to the meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. Accordingly we find in Ezekiel 43:24, \"The priest shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-16. - The third form of meat offering, parched grains of corn, with oil, salt, and frankincense.

The conditions to be fulfilled by a Jew who offered a peace offering were the following: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. He must bring eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) a young bull or cow, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) a young sheep of either sex, orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) a young he-goat or she-goat.NEWLINENEWLINE2. He must offer it in the court of the tabernacle.NEWLINENEWLINE3. In offering it he must place, or lean, his hand upon its head.NEWLINENEWLINE4. He must kill it at the door of the tabernacle.NEWLINENEWLINE5. He must provide three kinds of cakes similar to those offered in the meat offering, trod leavened bread (Leviticus 7:11-1-3). The priest had:NEWLINENEWLINE1. To catch the blood, and strike the sides of the altar with it, as in the burnt sacrifices.NEWLINENEWLINE2. To place upon the burnt offering, smoldering upon the altar, all the internal fat of the animal's body, together with the kidneys enveloped in it, and, in the case of the sheep, the fat tails, for consumption by the fire.NEWLINENEWLINE3. To offer one of each of the three different kinds of unleavened cakes, and one loaf of the leavened bread, as a heave offering.NEWLINENEWLINE4. To wave the breast of the animal backwards and forwards, and to heave the leg or haunch upwards and downwards, in token of consecration (see notes on Leviticus 7:14, 30, 31).NEWLINENEWLINE5. To take for his own eating, and that of his brethren the priests, the three cakes and loaf and haunch that had been heaved and waved.NEWLINENEWLINE6. To return the rest of the animal, and the remaining cakes and loaves, to the offerer, to serve as a feast for him and his, to be eaten the same or the next clay, in the court of the tabernacle. The lesson taught by the peace off, ring was the blessedness of being in union with God as his covenant people, and the duty and happiness of exhibiting a joyous sense of this relation by celebrating a festival meal, eaten reverently and thankfully in the house of God, a part of which was given to God's priests, and a part consumed symbolically by God himself. The burnt offering had typified self-surrender; the meat offering, loyal submission; the peace offering typified the joyous cheerfulness of those who, having in a spirit of perfect loyalty surrendered themselves to God, had become his children, and were fed at the very board at which he deigned symbolically to partake. The most essential part of the meat offering was the presentation; of the burnt offering, the consumption of the victim on the altar; of the peace offering the festive meal upon the sacrifice. The combined burnt and meat offering was the sacrifice of one giving himself up to God; the peace offering, that of one who, having given himself up to God, is realizing his communion with him. In this respect the peace offering of the old dispensation foreshadows the Lord's Supper in the new dispensation. Several other names have been proposed for the peace offering, such as thank offering, salvation offering, etc. No name is more suitable than peace offering, but the word must be understood not in the sense of an offering to bring shout peace, but an offering of those who arc in a state of peace, answering to the Greek word αἰρνηική, rather than to the Latin word pacifica. \"A state of peace and friendship with God was the basis and sine qua non to the presentation of a shelem, and the design of that presentation, from which its name was derived, was the realization, establishment, verification, and enjoyment of the existing relations of peace, friendship, fellowship, and blessedness\" (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - \"There were four parts to be burned upon the altar:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the fat that covereth the inwards, i.e., the large net, omentum, ἐπίπλους, caul, or adipose membrane found in mammals, attached to the stomach and spreading over the bowels, and which in the ruminants abounds with fat;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) all the fat which is upon the inwards, i.e., the fat attached to the intestines, and which could be peeled off;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, or loins, i.e., the kidneys and all the fat connected with them; the kidneys are the only thing to be burnt except the fat;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) the smaller net, omentum minus, or caul above the liver, which stretches on one side to the region of the kidneys, hence on the kidneys; עַל = by them, not with them' (Gardiner).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Upon the burnt sacrifice. The peace offering is to be placed upon the burnt offering previously laid upon the fire. Symbolically and actually the burnt offering serves as the foundation of the peace offering. Self-surrender leads to peace; and the self-sacrifice of Christ is the cause of the peace subsisting between God and man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The whole rump should no doubt be the whole tail, consisting chiefly of fat, and always regarded as a great delicacy in the East (see Herod., 3:113; Thompson, 'Land and the Book,' page 97). The burning of the fat tail upon the altar, together with the internal fat, is the only point in which the ritual to be used when offering a sheep (verses 6-11) differs from that used in offering a bull or cow (verses 1-5), or a goat (verses 12-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - It is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord; literally, It is the bread of the offering by fire to the Lord. The idea of the peace offering being that of a meal at God's board, the part of the animal presented to God upon the altar is regarded as his share of the feast, and is called his food or bread. Cf. Revelation 3:20, \"I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD'S.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Eat neither fat nor blood. These are forbidden to be eaten, as belonging to God. The fat, that is, the internal fat, is his portion in the common feast of the peace offering, and the blood is presented to him in all the animal sacrifices, as the material vehicle of life (see Leviticus 7:22-27). The remaining regulations as to the various sorts of the peace offerings, the priests' portions of them, and the festive meal on the sacrifices, are given in Leviticus 7:11-34.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Lev.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINETHE SIN OFFERING (Leviticus 4; Leviticus 5:1-13). At the time of the Mosaic legislation, burnt offerings and meat offerings were already in existence, and had existed from the time of the Fall. A beginning, therefore, is made with them, and the regulations of the peace offerings naturally follow, because these sacrifices succeed in order to the burnt and meat offerings, and because sacrifices in some respects of the same nature as peace offerings had previously existed under a different name (cf. Exodus 10:25 with Exodus 24:5, and see above notes on chapter 3). The sin and trespass offerings, therefore, are left to the last, though, owing to their meaning, they were always offered first of all, when sacrifices of all three kinds were made together. They are the means of ceremonially propitiating God when alienated from his people, or from any individual member of it, by sin, which they legally atone for. The need of expiation is implied and suggested by the offering of the blood, both in the burnt sacrifice and the peace offering (cf. Job 1:5). But this was not sufficient; there must be a special sacrifice to teach this great truth as its primary lesson. The sin offering typifies the sacrifice of our Lord JESUS CHRIST upon the cross, as the great Sin Offering for mankind, whereby the wrath of God was propitiated, and an expiation for the sins of man was wrought, bringing about reconciliation between God and man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - If a soul shall sin. The conditions to be fulfilled in presenting a sin offering differed according to the position held by the offerer in the state. If it were the high priest, he hadNEWLINENEWLINE(1) to offer a young bull in the court of the tabernacle;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) to place his hand upon it;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) to kill it;NEWLINENEWLINE(4) to take the blood into the holy place of the tabernacle, and there sprinkle some of it seven times in the direction of the vail that divided off the holy of holies within which the ark was placed, and to smear some of it on the horns of the golden altar of incense;NEWLINENEWLINE(5) to pour out the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offering in the court of the tabernacle;NEWLINENEWLINE(6) to burn all the internal fat upon the altar of burnt offering;NEWLINENEWLINE(7) to carry the whole of the remainder of the animal outside the camp, and there to burn it. If it were the congregation that made the offering, the same conditions had to be fulfilled, except that the elders of the congregation had to lay their hands on the animal. If it were a ruler, the animal offered was to be a male kid, and the priest, instead of taking the blood into the sanctuary, was to smear it on the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice in the court. If it were an ordinary member of the congregation, the animal was to be a female kid, or ewe lamb, which was to be dealt with in the same manner; or in some cases two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering (whose blood was all sprinkled round the inner side of the altar), the other for a burnt offering (which was to be treated according to the ritual of the burnt offering), or even the tenth part of an ephah of flour (without oil or frankincense), a handful of which was to be burnt, and the remainder delivered to the priest for his consumption. The moral lesson taught to the Jew by the sin offering was of the terrible nature of sin, and of the necessity for an expiation for it in addition to penitence. Mystically he might see that, as the blood of bulls and goats could not of its own virtue take away sin, there must be an offering, foreshadowed by the sacrifice of the animals, which should be effectual as these were symbolical The type is fulfilled by the atonement wrought by Christ's blood shed on the cross (see Hebrews 10:1-21). Further, the ceremonial cleansing of the sinful Israelite by the sin offering in the old dispensation foreshadows the effect of baptism in the new dispensation, for, as Calvin has noted in his Commentary, \"As sins are now sacramentally washed away by baptism, so under the Law also sacrifices were expiations, although in a different way.\" If a soul shall sin through ignorance. The expression, \"through ignorance\" (bishgagah), is intended to cover all sins except those committed \"with a high hand,\" or defiantly, whether the agent was ignorant that they were sins or was led into them by inconsiderateness or infirmity (cf. Psalm 19:12, 13, \"Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins\"). A better translation of bishgagah would be by want of consideration, or by inadvertence. Our Lord could say, even of those who crucified him, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do;\" and therefore even for them a sin offering might be made and be accepted. But for deliberate and determined sin the Law has no atonement, no remedy. The words, shall do against any of them, i.e., against the commandments, would be better rendered shall do any of them, i.e., the things which ought not to be done. There is no exact apodosis to this verse; it is a general heading to the chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-12. - The case of the high priest. He is designated the priest that is anointed, in respect to which title, see notes on chapter 8. In case he sins in his representative character, his sin is such as to bring guilt on the people (this is the meaning of the words translated according to the sin of the people), and a special sin offering must therefore be made. He is to take of the blood of the animal sacrificed, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:... and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary. And put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense. This was a more solemn method of presenting the blood to the Lord than that used in the burnt offering; the offering of the blood, which was the vehicle of life, being the chief feature in the sin offering, as the consumption of the whole animal by the altar fire was in the burnt offering. In the burnt offerings and peace offerings the blood was thrown once on the altar of burnt sacrifice (see chapter Leviticus 1:5); now it is sprinkled, in a smaller quantity each time, but as often as seven times (the number seven symbolically representing completeness), before the vail which shrouded the ark. The altar of sweet incense is the golden altar, which stood within the tabernacle, in front of the vail. Perhaps the reason why the horns of the altar are specially appointed to have the blood placed on them is that they were regarded as the most sacred part of the altar, because they were its highest points, in which its elevation towards heaven culminated. The remainder of the victim's blood is to be poured at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, in the court of the tabernacle, to sink into the ground, because no more of it was wanted for ceremonial use. The internal fat is to be burnt upon the altar of the burnt offering, but not actually upon the smoldering burnt sacrifice, as in the case of the peace offerings; the sin offering preceding the burnt offering in order of time, while the peace offering followed it. The remainder of the animal is to be carried without the camp... and be burnt, because its flesh was at once accursed and most holy. It was accursed, as having been symbolically the vehicle of the sins laid upon it by the offerer; therefore it must not be consumed upon the altar of God, but be destroyed with fire outside the camp, typifying the removal from God's kingdom, and the final destruction of all that is sinful. But yet it was most holy, as its blood had been taken into the tabernacle, and had served as a propitiation; therefore, if it had to be burnt, it yet had to be burnt solemnly, reverently, and as a ceremonial act, in a place appointed for the purpose. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that one of the points in which our Lord was the antitype of the sin offering was that he \"suffered without the gate,\" \"that he might sanctify the people with his own blood\" (Hebrews 13:12), which was thus indicated to have been carried within the sanctuary, that is, into heaven.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-21. - The case of the whole congregation. A nation may become guilty of national sin in different ways, according to its political constitution: most directly, by the action of a popular Legislature passing a decree such as that of the Athenian assembly, condemning the whole of the Mitylenean people to death (Thucyd., 3:36), or by approving an act of sacrilege (Malachi 3:9); indirectly, by any complicity in or condoning of a sin done in its name by its rulers. The ritual of the sin offering is the same as in the case of the high priest. The elders of the congregation (according to the Targum of Jonathan, twelve in number), acting for the nation, lay their hands on the victim's head, and the high priest, as before, presents the blood, by sprinkling it seven times before the Lord, even before the vail; and putting some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation. It is added that he shall thus make an atonement, or covering of sin, for them, and it shall be forgiven them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-26. - The case of a ruler or nobleman. The clause, Or if his sin... come to his knowledge, should be rather translated, If perhaps his sin come to his knowledge. He is to offer a kid of the goats, or rather a he-goat. The blood is not to be carried into the tabernacle, as in the two previous cases, but put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, which stood outside in the court, and, as a consequence of the blood not having been taken into the tabernacle, the flesh is not to be burnt outside the camp, but to be eaten by the priests in the court of the tabernacle (see Leviticus 6:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-35. - The case of a common man.

If a man hear the voice of swearing, that is, if he was one of a number of persons adjured to speak according to the manner in which oaths were administered in Jewish courts of justice (see Matthew 26:63; 2 Chronicles 18:15), and he did not give evidence of what he had seen or heard, he had to bear his iniquity, that is, he was regarded as guilty; and as this was an offense which could be atoned for by a sacrifice, he was to offer as a sin offering a ewe lamb, or a female kid, or two turtle-doves, or two pigeons, or the tenth part of an ephah of flour. This injunction is a direct condemnation of the approved teaching of Italian moral theologians of paramount authority throughout the Roman Church, who maintain that, in case a crime is not known to others, a witness in a court of justice \"may, nay, he is bound to, say that the accused has not committed it\" (St. Alfonso de' Liguori, 'Theol. Mor.,' 4:154).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - Two cases of a man ceremonially defiled.

If he sware to do evil, or to do good, that is, to do anything whatever, good or bad (see Numbers 24:13), and failed to fulfill his oath from carelessness or negligence, he too must bring his offering, as above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - In the four cases last mentioned there is first to be an acknowledgment of guilt, he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing, and then the sin offering is to be made. Confession of sin probably preceded or accompanied all sin offerings. The use of the word asham, translated trespass offering in verse 6, and the character of the four cases have led many commentators to regard verses 1-13 as dealing with the trespass offering rather than the sin offering. But if this were so, the words trespass offering and sin offering would be used synonymously in this verse, which is very unlikely, when they are immediately afterwards carefully distinguished. It is best to render asham \"for his trespass,\" that is, in expiation of his guilt, as in the next verse, in place of a trespass offering.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-13. - If he be not able to bring a lamb. Sin offerings being not voluntary sacrifices but required of all that were guilty, and the four last-named cases being of common occurrence amongst the poor and ignorant, two concessions are made to poverty: two birds (one to be offered with the ritual of the sin offering, the other with that of the burnt offering), or even some flour (either three pints and a half or three quarts and a half, according as we adopt the larger or smaller estimate of the amount of the ephah), are allowed when the offerer cannot provide a lamb or a kid. There is thus typically set forth the freedom with which acceptance through the great propitiation is offered to all without respect of persons. The non-bloody substitute, being permitted only as an exception for the benefit of the very poor and only in the four cases above specified, does not invalidate the general rule that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:14-19NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - If a soul commit a trespass. Two previous conditions were required of the Israelite before he might offer his trespass offering.NEWLINENEWLINE1. He must make compensation for any harm or injury that he had done.NEWLINENEWLINE2. He must give to the injured party a fine equal to one-fifth (i.e., two-tenths) of the value of the thing of which he had deprived him, if the wrong was capable of being so estimated.

The non-payment of tithes and offerings was looked upon as robbing Jehovah (Malachi 3:8), and therefore it is that a trespass offering, involving compensation, and not only a sin offering, is required to atone for the offense. The ram that is to be offered is to be of a value fixed by the priest (with thy estimation, i.e., according to the estimation of the priest), and the priest is to estimate it by shekels of silver; implying that its value must amount at least to shekels (in the plural), meaning two shekels (see Ezekiel 47:13, where \"portions\" means \"more than one portion,\" i.e., \"two portions\"). The shekel is considered to be equal to 2s. 7d. The shekel of the sanctuary means the shekel according to its exact weight and value, while still unworn by traffic and daily use. Beside offering the rain, he is to make amends for the harm (or rather sin) that he hath clone in the holy thing, and.. . add the fifth part. The fifth part is probably appointed as being the same as two-tenths of the principal sum. Full satisfaction is the marked feature of the trespass offering. In Luke 19:8, \"Zacchaeus stood, and said,... Behold, Lord,... if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold.\" He went far beyond his legal obligation in respect to compensation. (Cf. 2 Samuel 12:6, \"He shall restore the lamb fourfold.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-19.

Cf. the injunction in Leviticus 19:11: \"Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.\" Exodus 22:7-13 contains earlier legislation on the subject of things taken in trust.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Or have found that which was lost.

In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise.\" And sweareth falsely. By previous legislation it had been appointed that, in case of a doubt arising as to what had become of property delivered to another to keep, there should be \"an oath of the Lord between them both, that\" the latter \"hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good\" (Exodus 22:11). This opened the way to false swearing where men were dishonest. Sinning therein.

The further ritual of the burnt offering is exhibited in the particular instance of the lamb sacrificed every evening (Exodus 29:33). In other cases the ritual was to be the same. Instead of It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, the reading should be, It, the burnt offering (viz. the evening sacrifice), shall burn upon the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning. The priest is to wear his priestly dress already appointed (Exodus 28:40) - which was a white linen garment, covering the whole person like a close-fitting English surplice, fastened by a sash - while he is actually officiating at the altar; and thus vested, he is to remove from the altar the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering, or rather, as it would be better translated, the ashes to which the fire hath reduced the burnt offering, and put them beside the altar, that is, on the ash-heap to the east of the altar. On leaving the court of the tabernacle, he is to change his dress, and to carry the ashes of the sacrifice without the camp unto a clean place. The priest is also instructed to lay fresh wood on the altar fire every morning, in preparation for the morning sacrifice of the lamb (Exodus 29:38). The fat of the peace offerings, that is, the parts of the peace offerings that were burnt on the altar, were laid on the burnt offering. The altar fire was never to go out, because the daily sacrifices constantly burning on the altar symbolized the unceasing worship of God by Israel, and the gracious acceptance of Israel by God. The ever-burning sacrifice was the token of the people being in communion with God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCommand Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-18. - The further ritual of the meat offering (see note on chapter Leviticus 2:1).

Not only is it most holy itself, but every one (or rather everything) that toucheth the offerings shall be holy. The touch of the offering conveys the character of holiness to the thing touched, which must, therefore, itself be treated as holy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall not be baken with leaven.

This was to be not of uncooked flour, but in the form of a pancake, made out of one-tenth of an ephah of flour. It, of course, accompanied the burnt offering appointed for the occasion. Half of it was burnt in the morning, that is, at the morning sacrifice, and half thereof at night, that is, the other half at the evening sacrifice, none being reserved for consumption by the priests. This meat offering, having first been offered at the consecration of Aaron, was afterwards to be offered at the consecration of each succeeding high priest, the expression Aaron and his sons meaning here the successive high priests. The statement that the offering is to be perpetual, has led to the belief that it was made every day by the high priest, from the time of his consecration onwards, and there is thought to be an allusion to this sacrifice in Ecclus. 45:14; but the more probable opinion is that it was only made on the day of consecration, that is, on the first day that he was qualified to act as high priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus6:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-30. - Further ritual of the sin offering (see note on chapter Leviticus 4:2). The flesh of the sin offerings is to be eaten by the priests and the males of their families in the holy place, that is, within the precincts of the sanctuary, with the exception of the sin offerings of the high priest and of the congregation, whereof... the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, which was to be burnt in the fire without the camp.

It is to be noted that the blood of the trespass offering is not to be placed on the horns of the altar, as was the rule in the ordinary sin offering, but cast against the inner side of the altar, as in the burnt offering and peace offering. The rump in verse 3 should be translated tail, as in chapter Leviticus 3:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10 contain a general precept or note as to the priests' portion in the sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, and meat offering. The officiating priest was to have the flesh of the trespass offering and of the sin offering (except the fat burnt on the altar), and the skin of the burnt offering and the cooked meat offerings (except the memorial burnt on the altar), while the meat offerings of flour and of parched grains, which could be kept longer, were to be the property of the priestly body in general, all the sons of Aaron,... one as much as another. The skins of the peace offerings were retained by the offerer ('Mishna, Sebaeh,' 12, 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-21. - Further ritual of the peace offering (see note on chapter Leviticus 3:1). There are three sorts of peace offerings - thank offerings (verses 12-15), votive offerings, and voluntary offerings (verses 16-18). Of these, the thank offerings were made in thankful memorial for past mercies; votive offerings were made in fulfillment of a vow previously taken, that such offering should be presented if a terrain condition were fulfilled. Voluntary offerings differ from votive offerings by not having been previously vowed, and from thank offerings by not having reference to any special mercy received. The thank offering must be eaten by the offerer and his friends, on the same day that it was offered; the votive and the voluntary offerings, which were inferior to the thank offering in sanctity, on the same day or the next. The reason why a longer time was not given probably was that the more the meal was delayed, the less would a religious character be attached to it. The necessity of a quick consumption also took away the temptation of acting grudgingly towards those with whom the feast might be shared, and it likewise precluded the danger of the flesh becoming corrupted. If any of the flesh remained till the third day, it was to be burnt with fire; if eaten on that day, it should not be accepted or imputed unto him that offered, that is, it should not be regarded as a sacrifice of sweet savour to God, but an abomination (literally, a stench), and whoever ate it should bear his iniquity, that is, should be guilty of an offense, requiring, probably, a sin offering to atone for it. The bread gift accompanying the animal sacrifice was to consist of three kinds of unleavened cakes, and one cake of leavened bread, and one out of the whole oblation, that is, one cake of each kind, was to be offered by heaving and then given to the officiating priest, the remaining cakes forming a part of the offerer's festive meal. If any one took part of a feast on a peace offering while in a state of Levitical uncleanness, he was to be cut off from his people, that is, excommunicated, without permission to recover immediate communion by offering a sin offering. St. Paul joined in a votive offering (Acts 21:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBesides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-27. - Repetition of the prohibition of eating the fat and the blood, addressed to the people in the midst of the instructions to the priests. Ye shall eat no manner of fat must be taken to mean none of the fat already specified, that is, the internal fat, and, in the case of the sheep, the tail; It is uncertain whether the law as to fat was regarded as binding upon the Israelites after they had settled in Palestine. Probably it was silently abrogated; but the prohibition of blood was undoubtedly perpetual (Deuteronomy 12:16), and it is based on a principle which does not apply to the fat (Leviticus 17:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-34. - Continuation of the ritual of the peace offerings (see note on Leviticus 3:1). The equal dignity of the peace offerings with the other offerings is vindicated by the command that the offerer shall bring it with his own hands, whereas it might have been regarded as merely the constituent part of a feast, and so sent by the hand of a servant. The breast and the right shoulder were to be waved and heaved (for \"heaved\" does not merely mean\" taken off,\" as some have said). The waving consisted of the priest placing his hands beneath those of the offerer who held the piece to be waved, and moving them slowly backwards and forwards before the Lord, to and from the altar; the heaving was performed by slowly lifting the pieces heaved upwards and downwards. The movements were made to show that the pieces, though not burnt on the altar, were yet in a special manner consecrated to God's service. The right shoulder was most probably the hind leg, perhaps the haunch. The Hebrew word is generally translated \"leg\" (Deuteronomy 28:35; Psalm 147:10). This part was the perquisite of the officiating priest; the waved breast was given to the priests' common stock. Afterwards an addition was made to the priests' portion (Deuteronomy 18:3; see 1 Corinthians 9:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35, 36. - Conclusion of the section. This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, may be translated simply, This is the portion of Aaron, and the portion of his sons, as the word \"mischah\" will bear the meaning of portion as well as of anointing. This rendering, however, is not necessary, as it was the anointing of Aaron and his sons that entitled them to these portions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 37, 38. - Conclusion of Part I. The law of the burnt offering is contained in Leviticus 1:1-17; Leviticus 6:8-13: of the meat offering, in chapter Leviticus 2:1-16; 6:14-23: of the sin offering, in Leviticus 4:1-35; Leviticus 5:1-13; Leviticus 6:24-30: of the trespass offering, in Leviticus 5:14-19; Leviticus 6:1-7; Leviticus 7:1-6: of the consecrations, in Leviticus 6:19-23, supplementing Exodus 29:1-37: of the sacrifice of the peace offerings, in Leviticus 3:1-17; Leviticus 7:11-21; 28-34. Together, the sacrifices teach the lessons of self-surrender, loyalty, atonement, satisfaction, dedication, peace.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus7:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-5. - These verses contain the preliminaries of the ceremony of consecration. Aaron and his sons are to be brought to the door of the tabernacle, together with all that is necessary for the performance of the rite that is about to take place. The words in the second verse, a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread, should be translated, the bullock for the sin offering and the two rams and the basket. The garments, the anointing oil, the bullock, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread and cakes, had all been previously enjoined, when Moses was on the mount (Exodus 28, 29, 30). These previous injunctions are referred to in the words, This is the thing which the Lord commanded to be done (verse 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Washing, robing, anointing, sacrificing, are the four means by the joint operation of which the consecration is effected. The washing, or bathing, took place in the sight of the people. The whole of the person, except so much as was covered by the linen drawers (Exodus 28:42), was washed. The symbolical significance is clear. Cleansing from sin precedes clothing in righteousness and spiritual unction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-9. - The robing. The various articles of the priestly dress had been appointed and described before (Exodus 28, 29). In these verses we see the order in which they were put on. After the priests had, no doubt, changed their linen drawers, there came, first, the coat, that is, a close-fitting tunic of white linen, made with sleeves and covering the whole body; next the girdle of the tunic, that is, a linen sash for tying the tunic round the body, with variegated ends hanging on each side to the ankles; thirdly, the robe, that is, a blue vesture, woven of one piece, with holes for the head and arms to pass through, reaching from the neck to below the knee, the bottom being ornamented with blue, purple, and scarlet pomegranates, alternating with golden bells; fourthly, the ephod, which consisted of two shoulder-pieces, or epaulettes, made of variegated linen and gold thread, fastened together in front and at the back by a narrow strap or band, from which hung, before and behind the wearer, two pieces of cloth confined below by the curious girdle of the ephod, that is, by a sash made of the same material as the ephod itself. Into the ephod were sewn two onyxes, one on each shoulder, in gold filigree settings, one of them engraven with the names of half of the tribes, and the other with the remaining half; and from two rosettes or buttons by the side of these stones depended twisted gold chains for the support of the breastplate. Fifth came the breastplate, which was a square pocket, made of embroidered linen, a span long and a span broad, worn upon the breast and hanging from the gold chains above mentioned, the lower ends of the gold chain being tied to two rings at the upper and outer corner of the breastplate, while the upper and inner corner of the same was attached to the ephod by blue thread running through two sets of rings in the breastplate and ephod respectively. The outer side of the breastplate was stiffened and adorned by twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three, each stone having on it the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate being double and the two sides and the bottom being sewn up, the pocket formed by it had its opening at the top. Into this pocket were placed the Urim and the Thummim, which were probably two balls of different colours, one of which on being drawn out indicated the approval of God, and the other his disapproval, as to any point on which the high priest consulted him. (The Jewish tradition, that the Divine answer by the Urim and the Thummim came by a supernatural light thrown on certain letters in the names of the tribes, has no foundation.) The last part of the dress to be put on was the mitre, or head-dress of linen, probably of the nature of a turban; to which, by a blue string, was attached the golden plate, in such a way that it rested lengthwise on the forehead, and on this plate or holy crown were inscribed the words,\" Holiness to the Lord.\" The investiture took place as the Lord commanded Moses, that is, in accordance with the instructions given in Exodus 28. Its purpose and its meaning in the eyes of the people would have been twofold: first, after the manner of the king's crown and the judge's robe, it served to manifest the fact that the function of priest was committed to the wearer; and next, it symbolized the necessity of being clothed upon with the righteousness of God, in order to be able to act as interpreter and mediator between God and man, thus foreshadowing the Divine Nature of him who should be the Mediator in antitype.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - The anointing is still more specifically the means of consecration than the investing or the washing. (For the anointing oil, which is here referred to as a thing well known, see Exodus 30:22-25, where its component parts are designated.) The consecration of things as well as of persons is sanctioned by the action of Moses, who anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. They were thus set apart for holy purposes. By all that was therein would be meant the ark, the vail, the altar of incense, the candlesticks, the table of show-bread. After the tabernacle and its furniture had been anointed, the altar - that is, the brazen altar - and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, were sprinkled; not once only, as the things within the tabernacle, but seven times, to show that it was specially holy, although situated only in the court. The laver, for the priests' use, was between the door of the tabernacle and the brazen altar of burnt offering. Its foot, or base, is described in Exodus 38:8, as made, according to the translation of the Authorized Version, \"of brass, of the looking-glasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head. The change of the verb poured for sprinkled, indicates that the amount of \"the precious ointment\" poured \"upon the head, that ran down unto the beard, and went down to the skirts of his garments\" (Psalm 133:2), was far greater than that with which the furniture of the tabernacle had been anointed. The oil sprinkled on the holy things sanctified them as means of grace. The oil poured upon Aaron represents the grace of the Holy Spirit, coming from without, but diffusing itself over and throughout the whole consecrated man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The investiture of Aaron's sons - Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, Ithamar - follows the consecration of their father. They are robed, according as the Lord commanded Moses in Exodus 28:40, in the white tunic, the sash, and the cap. But there is no statement here of their being anointed, although their anointing is ordered in Exodus 28:41, and still more imperatively in Exodus 40:15. They are spoken of as \"anointed\" in Leviticus 7:36, and as having \"the anointing oil of the Lord upon them\" in Leviticus 10:7. On the other hand, the high priest is specially designated as \"the priest that is anointed\" (Leviticus 4:3). It is probable that the personal anointing of the ordinary priests was confined to their being sprinkled with oil, as described below in verse 30; but that they were regarded as virtually anointed in Aaron's anointing. The Levites had no special dress until they obtained permission from Herod Agrippa I[. to wear the priestly robes (Joseph., 'Ant.,' 20:09, 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-32. - After the bathing, the robing, and the anointing, follow the sacrifices of consecration - the sin offering (verses 14-17), the burnt offering (verses 18-21), the peace offering (verses 22-32). Verse 14. - The sin offering. This was the first sin offering ever offered. There had been burnt offerings and sacrifices akin to peace offerings before, but no sin offerings. At once the sin offering takes its place as the first of the three sacrifices before the burnt offerings and peace offerings. Justification comes first, then sanctification, and, following upon them, communion with God. The victim offered by and for Aaron and his sons is a bullock, the same animal that is appointed for the offering of the high priest (Leviticus 4:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - And Moses took the blood. Moses continues still to act as priest, and the new sacrifice is once offered by him. He performs the priestly act of presenting the blood; but on this occasion, which is special, the blood is not dealt with in the manner prescribed for the high priest's offerings (Leviticus 4:6). The reason of this is that Aaron was not yet high priest, and also that the offering was made not only for Aaron, but also for his sons; and further, the blood as well as the anointing oil was required to purify the altar, and sanctify it (see Hebrews 9:21). Although the blood was not \"brought into the tabernacle,\" yet the bullock was burnt with fire without the camp, not eaten according to the rule of Leviticus 7:26, 30. This was necessary, as there were as yet no priests to eat it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-21. - There is no deviation on the present occasion from the ritual appointed for the burnt offering. After the sin offering, righteousness is symbolically imputed to Aaron; after the burnt offering, holiness; then follows the peace offering of the ram, which completes and sacrificially effects the consecration.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-29. - The ram offered as a peace offering is called the ram of consecration, or literally, of filling, because one of the means by which the consecration was effected and exhibited was the filling the hands of those presented for consecration with the portion of the sacrifice destined for the altar, which they waved for a wave offering before the Lord, previous to its consumption by the fire. This portion consisted of the internal fat and tail, which was usually burnt (Leviticus 7:31), and the heave offering of the right shoulder, or hind leg, which generally went to the officiating priest (Leviticus 7:32), and one of each of the unleavened cakes. After this special ceremony of waving, peculiar to the rite of consecration, the usual wave offering (the breast) was waved by Moses and consumed by himself. Ordinarily it was for the priests in general (Leviticus 7:31). The blood was poured on the side of the altar, as was done in all peace offerings, but in addition, on the present occasion, it was put upon the tip of the right ear, and upon the thumb of the right hand, and upon the great toe of the right foot of the priests who were being consecrated, symbolizing that their senses and active powers were being devoted to God's service. The same ceremony is to be used in the restoration of the leper (see chapter Leviticus 14:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The sprinkling with oil and blood completes the ceremony of anointing, and suffices of itself for the sons of Aaron, in addition to their virtual participation in the anointing of their father (verse 12). \"In the mingling of the blood and oil for the anointing seems to be taught that not sacrifice for sin alone suffices; but that with this must be joined the unction of the Holy Spirit\" (Gardiner).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31, 32. - The flesh of the peace offering is given to Aaron and his sons to eat, not in the capacity of priests (for the peace offerings were not eaten by the priests), but as the offerers of the sacrifice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-36. - The sacrificial ceremonies were repeated for seven days, during which Aaron and his sons remained in the court of the tabernacle, but did not enter the holy place, abstaining throughout that time from ministering, as the apostles did during the interval between the Ascension and the day of Pentecost. The words, Ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle, should rather be, Ye shall not go away from the entrance of the tabernacle, and for seven days shall he consecrate you, should rather be, during seven days ye shall be consecratedNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus8:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Lev.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - On the eighth day. The seven days of consecration being now over, Aaron for the first time offers a sin offering and burnt offering for himself, and a sin offering, a burnt offering, a peace offering, and a meat offering for the congregation. He is still instructed by Moses as to what he is to do, but it is through him that the command is given to the people to present their offerings, and it is he that slays the victims and offers their blood. His own sin offering is a young calf, or young bull calf, whereas the sin offering commanded for the high priest on ordinary occasions was a young bull, further advanced in age (Leviticus 4:3); and in presenting the blood he does not take it into the sanctuary according to the regulations in chapter Leviticus 4:6, but uses it as Moses had done in the sin offerings of the previous week, the purpose of the difference being to show that Aaron's full dignity had not yet devolved upon him. This did not take place until he had gone into the tabernacle with Moses (verse 23). A ram is again taken for the burnt offering, as had been the case in Moses' sacrifice of the previous week. The children of Israel now present a kid, the offering generally made by a prince, that for the congregation being a young bull. In the words for today the Lord will appear unto you, Moses promises the Divine appearance afterwards vouchsafed (verse 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Make an atonement for thyself, and for the people. By means of the sin offering for the high priest, whose sin brought guilt both on himself and upon the people (Leviticus 4:3). After he had (symbolically) purified himself and them of this guilt, he was to offer the offering of the people, which should purify them from the guilt contrasted by their own sins, and make an atonement for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-14. - The high priest's sin offering and burnt offering for himself. The meat offering does not appear to have accompanied the burnt offering - the law having not yet been promulgated which ordered that the two sacrifices should always be presented together (Numbers 15:4). The burnt offering, with the pieces thereof, in verse 13, should rather be the burnt offering in its several pieces. The sinfulness of the Aaronic priesthood and the need of a perfect priest is indicated by this sacrifice (see Hebrews 7:24-27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-21. - The people's sin offering, burnt off, ring, meat offering, and peace offerings follow. The meat offering is said to have been burnt upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. It is probable that, on this occasion, the people's burnt offering, which consisted of a calf and a lamb, took the place of the ordinary morning sacrifice of a lamb (Exodus 29:38). Aaron is said to have offered the burnt offering according to the manner, or, as it is given in the margin, ordinance, that is, he burnt the flesh on the altar (Leviticus 1:7-9); he also burnt the handful of the meat offering, and he burnt the fat of the peace offering, upon the altar. He had previously burnt the fat of his own sin offering, and the flesh of his burnt offering. Fire, therefore, was present upon the altar, and was used by Aaron, as by Moses, for sacrificial purposes before the fire came out from the Lord as described in verse 24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And Aaron lifted up his hand or (according to the more probable reading) hands. This was the first priestly benediction by Aaron, given from the elevated standing-place which he occupied by the side of the altar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Moses (for the last time) and Aaron (for the first time) went into the tabernacle in the character of priest. During this visit Moses committed to Aaron the care of the things within the tabernacle, as he had already given him the charge of all connected with the sacrifices of the court. Not till after this is Aaron fully initiated into his office. \"No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron\" (Hebrews 5:4). On coming out from the tabernacle, Moses and Aaron, standing near the door, unite in blessing the congregation, in order to show the harmony between them and the capacity of blessing in the Name of the Lord enjoyed by Aaron as by Moses. The latter has now divested himself of that part of his office which made him the one mediator between God and his people, Aaron is henceforth a type of Christ as well as Moses. While giving the joint blessing, the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people, proceeding from the ark, and enveloping the lawgiver and the priest as they stood together.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTLeviticus9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And there came a fire out from before the Lord. The sacrifices were already smouldering on the altar, a ram, a calf, and a lamb, besides the internal fat of a young bull, a kid, a bullock, and a ram, and a handful of flour. They would have continued smouldering all the day and the night, but a miraculous fire issued from the tabernacle, and consumed the whole in the sight of the people. So fire fell and consumed Solomon's sacrifice at the dedication of the temple. Jewish tradition reports that the fire was always kept alive until the reign of Manasseh, when it became extinguished. When the people saw this sight, they shouted, and fell on their faces. They had been standing in a state of intense expectation, awaiting the fulfillment of the promise that the Lord would appear unto them today, and watching the acts of the two brothers; and their feelings are now raised to the utmost enthusiasm and awe by the appearance of the glory of the Lord and the notion of the Divine fire.
