It is true that while Genesis 25:3 (cf. 1 Chronicles 1:32) speaks of Sheba, the son of Joktan, one of the colonists of southern Arabia, Genesis 10:7 and 1 Chronicles 1:9 mention another Sheba, the son of Cush, and a doubt has arisen whether this was an Arabian or an Ethiopian princess, and it is alleged that she was the latter by Josephus, who calls her \"queen of Egypt and Ethopia,\" and by some Rabbinical writers, and in the traditions of the Abyssinian church. But the kingdoms of Sheba (שְׁבָא) and Saba (סְבָא) are entirely distinct (Psalm 72:10), the latter being the name both of the capital and country of Meroe, a province of Ethopia (Joshua, Ant. 2:10. 2); while the former in like manner designates both the chief city and also the kingdom of the Sabeans (Job 1:15). This tribe would seem to have grown richer and stronger than all the other Arabian peoples by means of its commercial enterprise, and it was especially famed for its gold, gems, and spices (Ezekiel 27:22; Jeremiah 6:20; Isaiah 60:6; Joel 3:8; Job 6:19; Psalm 72:10). It is noticeable that in both kingdoms government by female sovereigns was not uncommon (cf. Acts 8:27); but it is very remarkable to find any country under the rule of a queen at this early date. (The idea that either of these lands was always governed by queens has no real basis.) The name of this princess, according to the Koran, was Balkis, according to Abyssinian belief, Maqueda. Whether she was a widow or virgin is unknown] heard [Heb. hearing. Doubtless through the Arab traders. The record of this visit, following immediately upon the mention of the voyages (1 Kings 9:26), is a grain of evidence in favour of locating Ophir in Arabia] of the fame (Heb. hearing; cf. ἀκοή, which also means the thing heard, report. Compare ἀποκάλυψις καύχησις, etc.] of Solomon concerning the name [Heb. לְשְׁם, i.e., \"in relation to, in connexion with, the name,\" etc. No doubt it was the house he had built לְשֵׁם יְיָ (cf. 1 Kings 3:2; 1 Kings 5:17, 18; 1 Kings 8:17, 18, 19, 20, etc.) had made him famous. But the expression is somewhat unusual, and these words are omitted by the chronicler. Gesenius and Ewald, however, regard the ל as instrumental, \"the fame given him by the name,\" etc., as Judges 7:18; Ezekiel 12:12, etc., and Wordsworth compares the use of ἐν in Greek. The LXX. and other versions read \"the name of Solomon and the name of the Lord.\" But the text is on every ground to be retained. The alliteration in this verse (probably accidental) is to be noticed. There is also a slight paronomasia] of the Lord, she came to prove (LXX. πειράσαι, to test)] him with hard questions [Heb. in riddles; LXX. ἐν αἰνίγμασι. The Arabian mind has ever delighted in dark sayings, enigmas, etc., and extensive collections of these have been made by Burckhardt and others (see Keil in loc.) According to Dius (cited in Josephus, Contra Ap. 1:17. 18) Solomon also had dialectical encounters with Hiram and with Abdemon, or, according to Menander, a younger son of Abdemon, a man of Tyre.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And she came to Jerusalem [a great undertaking in those days. Our Lord lays stress on this long journey, ἐκ τῶν περάτων τῆς γῆς, Matthew 12:42; Luke 11:31] with a very great train [Heb. with a very heavy force or host (חַיִל). Thenius understands the words of an armed escort, which may well have been necessary considering the countries through which she passed, and the treasures she carried. It would also be quite in the spirit of the age that the queen should be escorted by a band of her soldiers. But it is not so certain that this idea was in the historian's mind], with [not in Hebrews] camels [2 Chronicles 9:1 has \"and camels.\" But the word is here explicative of the חַיִל preceding (Keil). It does not, however, decide against an armed force, as camels would be in any case required. The camel was a familiar object to the Jews (Exodus 9:3; Leviticus 11:4; Deuteronomy 14:7, etc.); but such a procession as this would create great astonishment in Jerusalem, and we may imagine how the people would line the bazaars as she passed, and the acclamations with which they would greet the queen (cf. 1:40; Matthew 21:9) and her swart attendants] that bare spices [Heb. balsams; hence spices generally; LXX. ἡδύσματα. Exodus 25:6; Exodus 35:28; Ezekiel 27:22. The perfumes of Arabia are proverbial (see Herod. 3:107-113), and Yemen is the chief spice country (Dict. Bib. 1. p. 91], and very much gold [Psalm 72:15. Gold is not now found in Arabia, nor are there any traces of gold mines; but Strabo and Diodorus both state that it was found there, and, according to the latter, in nuggets of considerable size (Dict. Bib. 1. p. 707). It is quite possible, however, that much of the \"gold of Arabia\" came to its emporiums from other lands. This particular present was doubtless brought by the queen because she had heard of the extensive use made of it by Solomon, and of the enormous quantities he required. \"Strabo relates that the Sabeans were enormously wealthy, and used gold and silver in a most lavish manner in their furniture, their utensils, and even on the walls, doors, and roofs of their houses\" (Rawlinson)] and precious stones [the onyx, emerald, and turquoise are still found in Arabia, and in former times the variety was apparently much greater (Plin., Nat. Hist. 37.)]; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of [Heb. spake to him] all that was in her heart. [The words are not to be restricted, as by Keil, to riddles.

According to Keil, \"the rooms of the inferior servants.\" But ver. 8 appears to be decisive against this view] of his ministers [i.e., those who ministered to him. The word \"servants\" is, perhaps, to be understood of state officers; the word \"ministers\" of personal attendants (as in Acts 13:5, etc.) That the latter were an inferior class, the \"standing\" shows], and their apparel [cf. Matthew 6:29. The rich and costly dress of Eastern courtiers and attendants is sometimes furnished by the king (Genesis 45:22; 1 Samuel 18:4; 2 Kings 5:5; Daniel 5:7; Esther 5:8; 1 Macc. 10:20. Cf. Chardin, \"Voyage en Perse,\" 3:230], and his cupbearers [By this word Keil would understand \"drinking arrangements.\" But see 2 Chronicles 9:4, \"cupbearers (same word) and their apparel\"], and his ascent [עֹלָתו. It is somewhat doubtful whether we are to interpret this word, ascent, or burnt offering. 2 Kings 16:18, 1 Chronicles 26:16, Ezekiel 40:26 make for the former, and the chronicler has עֲלִיָּתו. which undoubtedly means \"ascent.\" But all the translations understand the word of burnt offerings - the LXX. has καὶ τὴν ὀλοκαύτωσιν ( and the word, \"which occurs at least 300 times in the Bible,\" always (with one exception) signifies burnt offering. It is objected against this interpretationNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that we should require the plural, i.e., \"burnt offerings;\" but this is by no means certain, as the historian may refer to one particular holocaust (see 1 Kings 9:25) which the queen witnessed; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the sight of burnt offerings could not have caused her any astonishment (Keil). But their prodigious number may surely have done so; and we are certainly to understand that Solomon was remarkable for the scale of his sacrifices. Considering, however, that the word undoubtedly means \"ascent\" in Ezekiel 40:26, and that it is so paraphrased by the chronicler, it is perhaps safer to retain this rendering here]; there was no more spirit in her [same expression Joshua 5:1, and cf. 2:11.

But this inference is unwarranted. Polytheism permitted, and, indeed, encouraged, a full recognition of the gods many of the different races and regions. See on 1 Kings 5:7, and cf. 2 Chronicles 2:12 and Ezra 1:3. Observe, too, it is \"Jehovah, thy God.\" And it is very significant that all her gifts and treasures were for the king; none were offerings to the temple] which delighted in thee [cf. 1 Kings 5:7], to set thee on the throne of Israel; because the Lord loved Israel forever [a graceful and thoroughly Oriental compliment.

Hall). As to the talent, see on 1 Kings 9:14], and of spices very great store [Heb. much exceedingly (Ewald, 287 c.) \"The immense abundance of spices in Arabia.. is noted by many writers. Herodotus says that the whole tract exhaled an odour marvellously sweet (3:113). Diodorus relates that the odour was carried out to sea to a considerable distance from the shore (3:46). According to Strabo the spice trade of Arabia was in the hands of two nations, the Sabeans and Gerrhaeans, whose profits from it were so enormous that in his time they were the two wealthiest nations on the face of the earth (16. 4. 19),\" Rawlinson], and precious stones; there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. [Josephus states (Ant. 8.6.6) that the cultivation of the balsam in Palestine dates from this visit; the plant having been one of the queen's gifts. The two following verses form a sort of parenthesis. In speaking of the gold and gems brought by the Arabian queen, it occurs to the historian to state that both of these commodities were also brought in by the fleet. Possibly, too, the mention of the spices reminded him of the fragrant almug trees brought from Ophir (Bahr). But it would rather seem that they are included as one of the chief products of the voyage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the navy of Hiram also [i.e., built and equipped by him, 1 Kings 9:26-28], that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees [In 2 Chronicles 2:8; 2 Chronicles 9:10, called \"algum trees.\" The origin and meaning of the word are alike uncertain. By some (see Gesen., Thessalonians 1. p. 93) the Al is supposed to be the Arabic article, as found in Al-coran, Al-cohol, Ad-miral, etc., but later authorities (see, e.g., Max Muller,\" Science of Language,\" p. 214) lend no support to this view. \"Celsius enumerates fifteen different trees, each of which has been supposed to have a claim to represent the almug tree of Scripture\" Dict. Bib. 3. Appendix, p. 6.) It is now, however pretty generally agreed that the red sandalwood (pterocarpus sandaliorus, Linn.; or, according to others, santalum album, the white species) is intended - a tree which grows in India and on the coast of Malabar. It is said that in India sandalwood is called valguha (same root); and Stanley sees in almug the \"Hebraized form of the Deccan word for sandal.\" Dr. Hooker, however, (Dict. Bib. l.c.) regards the question as still undecided], and precious stones. [Stanley remarks on the frequent references to gold and silver and precious stones in the Book of Proverbs (Proverbs 1:9; Proverbs 3:14, 15; Proverbs 8:10, 11; Proverbs 10:20; Proverbs 16:16, etc.), as one indication that it belongs to the age of Solomon.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the king made of the almug trees pillars [lit., props. In 2 Chronicles 9:11 we have a different word, מְסִלות (cf. Judges 20:31, 32; 1 Samuel 6:12, etc.), there translated stairs. The word in the text מִסְעָד is ἅπαξ λεγ. Keil understands \"steps with bannisters;\" Bahr (after Jarchi) \"tesselated pavements;\" Gesenius, \"balusters;\" Thenius, \"divans;\" Bottcher, \"benches and similar moveables.\" But was not the pavement already laid, and of cedar; and would the sanctuary have divans, etc.?] for the house of the Lord, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries [also mentioned together (Psalm 71:22; Psalm 108:2; cf. 3). They were stringed instruments, but their precise shape and character is quite uncertain. One species of sandalwood, or of wood closely allied to it, is said to have been much sought after for musical instruments] for the singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.

[Heb. according to the hand of king Solomon. The chronicler has, \"beside that which she had brought unto the king.\" That is to say, in addition to the fitting presents which he made in return for her gifts, he freely gave her whatsoever she asked for. To ask for a coveted thing is no breach of Oriental propriety. The Ethiopian Christians find in these words (and considering the character of Solomon and the license of that age, perhaps not altogether without reason) a basis for their belief that she bore Solomon a son, Melimelek by name, from whom, indeed, the present sovereigns of Abyssinia claim to derive their descent.] So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. Bishop Wordsworth has remarked (p. 44) that the record of this visit disappoints us. He says, \"He (Solomon) answered her hard questions. He showed her his palace... but we do not hear that he invited her to go up with him into the house of the Lord,\" etc. Again: \"The visit of the queen of Sheba seem to have been without any spiritual result.\" \"In like manner,\" he adds, \"we hear nothing of any attempt on Solomon's part to improve his friendship and commercial relations with Hiram into an occasion for communicating the better merchandise of Divine truth to the Sidonians.\" But surely this criticism overlooks the fact that Judaism was not a missionary religion, and that the chosen people had no sort of commission to convert the heathen, It is, no doubt, a mystery; but it is a fact, that for 2,000 years the light of God's truth was, by the counsel and purpose of God, restricted within the extremely narrow confines of Israel, and that the \"fulness of the time,\" when the Gentiles should be \"fellow heirs,\" was distant from Solomon's day by a whole millennium.,NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:14-29. SOLOMON'S WEALTH, POMP, AND POWER. The visit of the Queen of Sheba, in itself a striking proof of the fame and greatness of Solomon, is followed by a description of his revenues, his throne, and various other particulars of his wealth and magnificence, some of which are related here because they were the products of the voyages of that same fleet which had been the means of acquainting the queen with Solomon and his glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year [probably one particular and exceptional year, probably also the year of the queen's visit, not year by year (Wordsworth, al.), as the Vulgate (per singulos annos). One fleet only came home from its voyage after three years, and the gold would hardly weigh precisely 666 talents year by year] was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold. [The correspondence with the number of the Beast (Revelation 13:18; cf. Ezra 2:13) is in all probability not altogether accidental. It is possible, i.e., that the number of the beast is a reminiscence of this number of talents. For we may surely see in this statement of Solomon's prodigious wealth an indication of his worldliness, the turning point, perhaps, in his estrangement from God. \"The love of money\" may have been the root of all his evil. It is certainly remarkable that from this time forward his career is one of steady declension. It is also remarkable that while he is here represented to us as a \"royal merchant,\" the mark of the beast is on the buyers and sellers (Revelation 13:17). But see \"Expositor,\" May, 1881. It is, of course, possible that the number has been corrupted, but, on the other hand, it may have been recorded, partly because of the singularity of the sum total. The 666 talents include the receipts from all sources - taxes, tribute, and voyages - with the exception made presently (ver. 15). Rawlinson quotes Keil (in his earlier edition) as estimating this amount at £3,646,350. But in his later work, Keil puts it in round numbers at two and a half millions (17,000,000 thalers), while Mr. Peele calculates it at about £8,000,000. These widely varying figures are instructive, as showing that both estimates are little more than guesswork. We do not know the value of the Hebrew talent, nor, indeed, can it ever be rightly appraised until we know its purchasing power. The denarius, e.g., is generally valued at 8½ d. (or 7½ d.) because it contained some 58 grains of pure silver but its real value was nearer three shillings, inasmuch as it was a fair wage for a day's work on the land (Matthew 20:2). In any case, it is clear that this sum should hardly be compared with the annual revenue of other Oriental empires, as by Rawlinson (see above).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Beside that he had of the marchantmen [The root תּוּר signifies to wander or travel about. In Numbers 13:16, 17, it is used of spies. It may here be applied to persons who travelled for purposes of trade; but the versions differ very materially in their rendering of the word; the LXX. understanding it of tribute (τῶν φόρων τῶν ὑποτεταγμένων); the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic of artizans; the Vulgate of ambassadors. And the word is nowhere else used of traders. For the construction, see Ewald 287e], and of the traffick [it is noteworthy that no such word is used before הַתָּרִים above] of the spice [not in Hebrews] merchants רָכַל is akin to רָגַל Like the preceding word, the primary meaning is to go about (תווט רֶגֶל); hence, to trade. It is probable that Solomon's great commercial enterprises were conducted for his own benefit, i.e., that the merchants were little more than agents, who bought and sold for the king. Such is the custom of Eastern kings (Kitto)], and of all the kings of Arabia [הָעֶרֶב is very variously interpreted. According to Gesenius it means foreigners, and he would understand \"foreign kings who made an alliance with the Israelites,\" and so the Chaldee. Keil: \"the kings of the mixed population\" (mentioned Exodus 12:38. Cf. Jeremiah 50:37; Nehemiah 13:3). Perhaps the words are best explained by Jeremiah 25:24: \"The kings of Arabia (עֲרָב) and ... of the mingled people (עֶרֶב) that dwell in the desert,\" i.e., the desert of Arabia deserta, bordering on Palestine. The chronicler here gives us עֲרָב, i.e., not the Arabia of the geographers, but the tract of country south and east of Palestine, as far as the Red Sea (Gesenius). No doubt these kings, who were great sheepmasters, paid their tribute in flocks of sheep and goats (2 Chronicles 17:11; 2 Kings 3:4], and of the governors of the country. [The word פַחות (cf. ch. 20:24) is a foreign word, perhaps Sanskrit, apparently borrowed by the Jews from the Persians. It is used of Tatnai (Ezra 5:6), of Zerubbabel (Haggai 1:1), and of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 5:14). Probably our author, in whose day it was a familiar and well understood word, substituted it for some older Hebrew designation. But the office and character of these \"governors\" is more difficult to define than the name. Rawlinson thinks that, in some parts of the empire, the kings - the \"empire of Solomon,\" he observes, \"was in the main a congeries of small kingdoms\" - \"had been superseded by governors.\" But it seems as natural to understand the term of the twelve prefects mentioned in chap. 4, who were \"the governors of the land,\" or of similar officers in the different outposts of the kingdom. We know that the contributions which passed through their hands were furnished in kind; hence, perhaps, it is that this income is distinguished from the gold of ver. 14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And king Solomon made two hundred targets [צִנָּה, from a root which signifies protect, a large oblong shield, which covered the entire person (Psalm 5:12), θυρεός, scutum. See 1 Samuel 17:7, 41. The LXX. here reads δόρατα, i.e., spears] of beaten gold [The authorities are divided as to the meaning of שָׁחוּט, here translated beaten. This rendering is supported by Bahr and Keil (after Kimchi), but Gesenius understands mixed gold. Rawlinson infers from the weight that the shields were only plated (shields were commonly made of wood, covered with leather). But whether they were solid or not does not decide the question whether the gold was pure or alloyed. \"Shields of gold\" are mentioned 2 Samuel 8:7; 1 Macc. 6:39]: six hundred shekels [Heb. omits shekels, as elsewhere, Genesis 24:22; Genesis 37:28; Judges 8:26, etc. There were apparently two kinds of shekel, the Mosaic and the royal (for the latter see 2 Samuel 14:26). The former was twice as much as the latter, but there is no agreement amongst commentators as to the weight or value of either. Nor can we be certain which is indicated here. Thenius decides for the former, and estimates the weight of the gold on each target to be 17 ½ lbs., and the value to be 6000 thalers (£900), or, according to Keil, 5000 thalers (£750). Keil, however, inclines to the belief that the royal shekel is meant, in which case the weight would be 9 lbs., and the value about £400. Bahr, however, estimates the gold at no more than £78 (523 thalers)] of gold went to one target.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And he made three hundred shields [portable shields (peltas, Vulgate) adapted for use in hand to hand encounters (2 Chronicles 12:9, 10; cf. 2 Samuel 1:21). That these were much smaller shields is clear from the text. These shields were borne by the royal bodyguard on great occasions (1 Kings 14:27). They were taken away by Shishak (ib. ver. 26)] of beaten gold; three pound [מָגֶה μνᾶ, mina. As 2 Chronicles 9:16 has here 300 shekels, it follows that the maneh = 100 shekels. From Ezekiel 45:12, however, it would seem that there were manehs of different value] of gold went to one shield [i.e., half as much as to the target]; and the king put them in [Heb. gave them to] the house of the forest of Lebanon [1 Kings 7:2. They would certainly be suspended on the walls, but whether on the inside or the outside is not quite certain, and the text affords us no means of deciding. We know that elsewhere shields were suspended outside the walls of armouries, etc. \"At Tyre the beauty of the place was thought to consist in the splendour and variety of the shields of all nations hung on its walls (Ezekiel 27:10, 11). In Rome the temple of Bellona was studded with them. In Athens, the round marks where they hung can still be traced on the walls of the Parthenon. There were also arms hung round the wails of the second temple (Jos., Ant. 15:11.3),\" Stanley. It is supposed that along with those made by Solomon were hung the shields taken by David from the Syrians, as according to 2 Samuel 8:7, LXX., these latter also were carried off by Shishak. It has been inferred from Song of Solomon 4:4 that these also were 500 in number, and that the entire thousand were suspended on a part of the house of the forest of Lebanon known as the Tower of David; cf. Isaiah 22:8; Psalm 47:9]. The historian now proceeds to describe the great feature of another of Solomon's palaces. As the house of the forest of Lebanon was distinguished by the golden shields which emblazoned and glorified its walls, so was \"the porch of judgment\" (1 Kings 7:7) by the chryselephantine throne.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Moreover the ling made a great throne [Heb. seat.

It is generally thought that this \"throne of the house of David\" (Psalm 122:5) was of wood, veneered with ivory, as was the practice in Assyria (Rawlinson, \"Ancient Monarchies,\" 1. p. 463), and in the chryselephantine statues of the Greeks (Paus. 2:4. 1; 6:25. 4, etc.) Bahr says there is no more necessity for believing this throne to have been of solid ivory than the \"ivory house\" mentioned in 1 Kings 22:39. Cf. Psalm 45:8; Amos 3:15; Amos 6:4. But there is surely this difference between them, that the palace could not possibly be constructed entirely of ivory, whereas the throne might be, and some of the thrones of India have been (Rawlinson)], and overlaid it with the best [מוּפָז, from the root פָּזַז, separavit = aurum depuratum. The chronicler explains the word by טָהור (2 Chronicles 9:17)] gold. [It is very unlikely that the gold entirely covered and concealed the ivory, especially if the latter was merely a veneer. Keil and Bahr consider that the gold was laid on the wood and the ivory inserted between the plates, but the text does not speak of overlaying with ivory, but of overlaying ivory with gold. And the presumption is that the ivory was solid. In the Greek statues both ivory and gold were applied in laminae, the former representing the flesh, the latter the drapery.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The throne had six steps [\"The characteristic feature in the royal throne was its elevation\" (Dict. Bib. ill. p. 1493); cf. Isaiah 6:1], and the top [Heb. head] of the throne was round behind [same word ch. 7:23, 24. Thenius and Bahr understand it of an arched or rounded canopy attached to the back; Keil supposes that the back was arched or rounded in form]: and there were stays [Heb. hands, i.e., arms] on either side on the place of the seat [see drawing of Assyrian throne in Layard's \"Nineveh,\" 2:301; Dict. Bib. 52. p. 1494], and two liens [probably of wood overlaid with gold. Cf. Jeremiah 10:3, 4] stood beside the stays.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other, upon the six steps [It is somewhat doubtful whether there were twelve or fourteen lions in all. Most commentators assume that there were fourteen, and the text will certainly bear that construction. But it is altogether more likely that there were twelve; that is to say, that the two lions on the topmost step are the two mentioned in the preceding verse as \"standing beside the stays,\" otherwise there would have been four lions on that step. And we all know that twelve had a significance such as could not attach to any other number (Bahr, Symbolik, 1:201-205; 2:133, 423). It would signify that all the tribes had an interest in the royal house (cf. 1 Kings 12:16; 2 Samuel 20:1); and a right of approach to the throne (cf. 1 Kings 18:31). The lion, a familiar emblem of sovereignty among many nations, had an especial appropriateness in this case, as being the symbol of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:9; cf. Numbers 23:24; Numbers 24:9). We are to see in them partly \"symbols of the ruler's authority\" (Keil), and partly, perhaps, they represented the twelve tribes as guardians of the throne. \"The king mounted between figures of lions to his seat on the throne, and sat between figures of lions upon it\" (Wordsworth). Thrones somewhat similar to this in character, but much less magnificent, are represented on the Assyrian monuments. The historian might justly add]: there was not the like made [Heb. not made so] in any kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And an king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold [as were those of Assyria and Babylon. This lavish display of wealth was characteristic of Oriental courts. Rawlinson quotes Chardin's description of the splendour of the court of Persia, \"Tout est d'or massif,\" etc., and adds, \"Both Symes and Yule note a similar use of gold utensils by the king of Ava (Symes, p. 372; Yule, p. 84)\"], and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold [סָגוּר; see on 1 Kings 6:20. LXX. χρυσίῳ συγκεκλεισμένα. This immense quantity of gold is quite paralleled in the accounts of profane writers. \"Sardanapalus, when Nineveh was besieged, had 150 golden bedsteads, 150 golden tables, a million talents of gold, ten times as much silver, etc. (Ctesias, ap. Athenaeus, 12. p. 29). No less than 7170 talents of gold were used for the vessels and statues of the temple of Bel in Babylon.. Alexander's pillage of Ectabana was estimated at 120,000 talents of gold,\" etc. (Bahr, in loc.)]; none were of silver [Heb. none silver. The Marg., \"there was no silver in them,\" i.e., they were unalloyed, is a misapprehension of the true meaning]: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - For [Reason why silver was so lightly esteemed. It was because of the prodigious quantity both of gold and silver brought in by the fleet] the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish [It has been much disputedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) whether this was a second fleet, or the same as that mentioned 1 Kings 9:26-28, as trading to Ophir, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) whether this fleet, if it were not the same, went to Ophir or to Tartessus in Spain. Keil and Bahr contend that there was Out one fleet, first, because there is no mention of a second fleet at 1 Kings 9:28, and, secondly, because the cargoes were practically the same. I incline (with Rawlinson, al.) to think there were two separate navies, for the following reasons:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The expression \"navy of Tarshish\" (in 2 Chronicles 9:21 expanded into \"ships going to Tarshish,\" which Keil and Bahr are compelled to set aside as a mistake on the part of the writer), taken in connexion with the following words, \"with (עִם, together with, as well as) the navy of Hiram\" (i.e., as we conclude from ver. 11, the navy manned, or, it may be, owned, by Hiram) points to a separate fleet;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the cargoes, so far from being the same, strike me as being altogether diverse. The Ophir fleet brought in \"gold, almug trees, and precious stones.\" The navy of Tarshish \"gold and silver ivory, apes, and peacocks.\" See below.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Even if we understand here by the \"navy of Hiram\" a Phoenician fleet, still a second fleet is indicated. But this leads us to consider the destination of these ships. The term, \"fleet of Tarshish,\" does not in itself prove anything, for the expression, \"ships of Tarshish,\" is almost a synonym for \"merchant vessels.\" In 1 Kings 22:48 we read, \"Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir,\" and they \"were broken at Ezion-geber\" (cf. Psalm 48:7; Jonah 1:3). It is probable that in Jewish lips the words were a nomen generale for all vessels going long voyages (Isaiah 2:16; Psalm 48:7; compare our \"East Indiaman,\" \"Greenlander\"). But the words \"in the sea,\" בַּיָּם, are most naturally understood of that ocean which the Jews called par excellence \"the sea,\" or \"the great sea\" (Numbers 34:6, 7), i.e., the Mediterranean, though the term הַיָּם is undoubtedly used of the Red Sea, the Sea of Galilee, and the Dead Sea. And the more so as we know that the Tyrians had an extensive commerce with Tartessus, which was a great emporium of trade from the earliest times. Bahr objects that \"no gold is found in Spain, but few peacocks, and little ivory;\" but Rawlinson, on the other hand, affirms that \"Spain had the richest silver mines known in the ancient world, and had a good deal of gold also\" (Plin., Nat. Hist. 3:4), while \"apes and ivory were produced by the opposite coast of Africa\" (Herod. 4:191. As to peacocks see below). And it is a powerful argument in favour of Tartessus that it is the plentifulness of silver in Solomon's days has suggested this reference to the fleet. For though silver \"was found in the land of the Nabataeans, according to Strabo, 16:784\" (Keil), yet it was to Tartessus that the ancient world was chiefly indebted for its supplies of that metal. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that second fleet, trading with the Mediterranean seaports, is here described. And Psalm 72:10 is distinctly in favour of this conclusion. When Ewald says (\"Hist. Israel,\" 3:263) that the Phoenicians would hardly tolerate a rival in the Mediterranean, he surely forgets that they had been admitted by the Jews to share the trade of Ophir] with the navy of Hiram; once in three years [This period agrees better with a voyage to Spain than to Southern Arabia. And if we understand it of Spanish voyages, it removes one difficulty in the way of placing Ophir in Arabia. It has also been urged that \"the Hebrews reckoned parts of years and days as whole ones\" (Kitte); but this hardly would apply to the expression \"once in three years\"] came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver ivory [Heb. tooth of elephants, LXX. ὀδόντες ἐλεφάντινοι. It is noteworthy that the name for elephant used here is derived from the Sanskrit (Gesen.), and an argument has been drawn hence in favour of placing Ophir in India, and of identifying the Tarshish fleet with the navy of Ophir. But such conclusions are extremely precarious. The name may have first come to the Jews from India, in which case it would be retained, from whatever quarter the commodity was subsequently derived. See Rawlinson, p. 546], and apes [קופis in like manner identified by Gesenius, al., with the Sanskrit kapi. Sir J. Emerson Tennant (\"Ceylon,\" 2 p 102) says \"the terms by which these articles (ivory, apes, and peacocks) are designated in the Hebrew Scriptures are identical with the Tamil names by which some of them are called in Ceylon to the present day\"], and peacocks. [So the the ancients interpret the original word, though some of the moderns would understand \"parrots.\" But the root תכי appears in several Aryan tongues (cf. ταῶς, from ταρως, and pavo) as indicating the peacock (Gesen., Max Muller, al.) which originally came from India. Whether it was also found in Africa is uncertain. Aristophanes (Birds, 485) says, καλεῖται Περσικὸς ὄρνις. Wordsworth very justly sees in the mention of these curious beasts and birds a symptom of declension in simplicity and piety, a token that \"wealth had brought with it luxury and effeminacy, and a frivolous, vainglorious love for novel and outlandish objects.'NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and wisdom [Cf. 1 Kings 3:13. \"There is something ominous of evil here.

The succeeding words, \"a rate year by year,\" would seem to imply the former; the fact that the visitors came not as subjects, but to \"hear the wisdom,\" etc., the latter. Bahr understands that the presents \"were repeated year by year, so highly had Solomon risen in estimation.\" But even this supposition does not explain the \"rate\"] vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments [cf. Genesis 45:22; 2 Kings 5:26; Ezra 2:69], and armour [rather, \"arms, weapons\" (Gesen.) Ewald understands perfume; LXX. στακτὴν, i.e., oil of myrrh], and spices [cf. ver. 10], horses and mules [see on 1 Kings 1:33], a rate year by year [Heb. the matter of a year in his year] . The remaining verses of this chapter, which, in the account of the chronicler, find a place at the end of the first chapter of his second book, repeat some of the information already given in 1 Kings 4:26 and 1 Kings 9:19, and furnish a few additional particulars as to the wealth and commerce of the king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And Solomon gathered together his chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots [these words have an important bearing on 1 Kings 4:26, where see note], and twelve thousand horsemen. [The question may suggest itself here, why did Solomon, who was a \"man of peace,\" maintain such a formidable array of chariots and horsemen? For not only was it in contravention of Deuteronomy 17:16 (cf. 1 Samuel 8:11), but it was entirely unnecessary, especially for a nation inhabiting a hilly country like that of Israel. We find, consequently, that David, when he took a thousand chariots from Hadarezer (1 Chronicles 18:4), only reserved for his own use one hundred of them, though he was at the time engaged in war. It may perhaps be said that this force was necessary to keep the tributary kings in due subjection. But it seems quite as likely that it was maintained largely for the sake of pomp and display. Solomon seems to have determined in every way, and at any cost, to rival and surpass all contemporary kings. The maintenance of this large force of cavalry is another token of declension], whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots (1 Kings 9:19), and with the king at Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones [an obviously hyperbolical expression], and cedar trees made he to be as the sycamore trees [the שִׁקְמָה is the συκομωρέα of the New Testament (Luke 19:4), i.e., as the name imports, the fig mulberry - the \"sycamine tree\" of Luke 17:6 would seem to denote the mulberry proper. Though now but comparatively rare in Palestine, it is clear that formerly it was very common (see, e.g., Isaiah 9:10, whence it appears that it was used for building purposes, and where it is also contrasted with the cedars). It was esteemed both for its fruit and its wood, so much so that David appointed a steward to have the supervision both of \"the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the Shefelah\" (1 Chronicles 27:28). The sycamores of Egypt, which were used for the coffins of mummies (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1394), are referred to in Psalm 78:47, in a way which bespeaks their great value. There is a good description of the tree in Thomson, \"Land and Book,\" 1:23-25] that are in the vale [Same word as in 1 Chronicles l.c. The Shefelah is a \"broad swelling tract of many hundred miles in area, which sweeps gently down from the mountains of Judah 'to mingle with the bounding main' of the Mediterranean\" (Grove, Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1611). This \"Low Country\" extended from Joppa to Gaza. The translation \"vale\" is altogether misleading. Conder (\"Tent-work,\" p. 5) describes it as \"consisting of low hills, about five hundred feet above the sea, of white soft limestone,\" and adds that \"the broad valleys among these hills... produce fine crops of corn, and on the hills the long olive groves flourish better than in other districts\" - an incidental and valuable confirmation of the text. \"The name Sifia, or Shephelah, still exists in four or five places round Beit Jibrin\" (Eleutheropolis), ib. p. 276] for abundance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. [This is a difficult passage, and the difficulty lies in the word מִקְוֶה, here rendered \"linen yarn.\" Elsewhere the word signifies, a congregation, or gathering, as of water (Genesis 1:10; Exodus 7:19; Leviticus 11:36). Consequently, Gesenius (with Vatablus, al.) would here interpret, \"company.\" \"And the company of kings' merchants took the company (of horses) at a price.\" The great difficulty in the way of this interpretation is perhaps the paronomasia, which, though not altogether without precedent, would be formal and unusual in grave history. Somewhat similarly Bahr: \"and as to horses... and their collection, the merchants of the king made a collection for a certain price,\" but this again is strained and artificial. Perhaps it is safer to see in the word the name of a place. The LXX. (similarly the Vulgate) renders, \"from Egypt and from Thekoa,\" καὶ ἐκ θεκουὲ, which Keil, however, contends is manifestly a variation of an older reading, καὶ ἐκ Κουὲ, \"and from Κουα.\" As to Koa or Kova, it is objected that no such place is mentioned elsewhere, and it is alleged that if it were a market for horses, or even if it were a frontier station, where the duties on horses were collected, we should surely have heard of it again. But this is by no means certain. Koa may well have been an in. significant post on the frontier which it was only necessary to mention in this connexion. Θεκουὲ certainly looks like an emendation, but it is to be remembered that although Tekoa (Amos 1:1; 2 Chronicles 11:6; 2 Chronicles 20:20) was apparently an insignificant village, still it gave its name to a district; it was no great distance from the Egyptian frontier - it was some six Roman miles south of Bethlehem, according to Jerome (in Amos, Proem.), and it may have been the rendezvous of the Egyptian and Hebrew horse dealers. The text would thus yield the following meaning: \"And as for the expert of Solomon's horses from Egypt and from Koa (or Tekoa), the king's merchants took them from Koa (or Tekoa) at a price.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And a chariot [including perhaps the two or three horses (see note on 1 Kings 5:6) usually attached to a chariot, and the harness. רֶכֶב is used (2 Samuel 8:4; 2 Samuel 10:18; Ezekiel 39:20) for chariot and horses] came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver [about £80 (Wordsworth, £35), but, as these figures show, the precise value cannot be ascertained with certainty. But it is quite clear that these amounts cannot have been the custom duty, or the profits after reckoning all expenses (Ewald) paid on chariots and horses, but must represent the actual price], and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites. [We can hardly see in these Hittites representatives of the seven nations of Canaan (Wordsworth, al.), though the term \"Hittite\" is sometimes undoubtedly used as a nomen generale for Canaanites (Joshua 1:4; Ezekiel 16:3), for the Canaanitish bes had been reduced to bond service, the Hittites amongst them (1 Kings 9:20). The word is probably used somewhat loosely of the semi-independent tribes bordering on Palestine, the Khatti of the Assyrian inscriptions (Dict. Bib. 1:819), with whom Solomon had a sort of alliance. It is a curious coincidence that we find horses and chariots associated in popular estimation with the Hittites, at a later period of the history (2 Kings 7:6). Nor are we justified in supposing that these horses and chariots were furnished as cavalry to \"Solomon's vassals, whose armies were at his disposal, if he required their aid\" (Rawlinson), for the kings of Syria are mentioned presently, and some of these at least were enemies to Solomon. Probably all we are to understand is that neighbouring nations received their supply of horses from Egypt - the home of horses and chariots (Exodus 14:6; Exodus 15:1; Deuteronomy 17:16; Isaiah 31:1; Jeremiah 46:2-4) - largely through the instrumentality of Solomon's merchants], and for the kings of Syria [\"who became the bitterest enemies of Israel\" (Wordsworth): one fruit of a worldly policy], did they bring them out by their means.

If the Ammonite or Moabite was not to be received into the congregation until the tenth generation (Deuteronomy 23:3); if the Israelite was not to seek their peace or prosperity all the days of his life (ver. 6), then the idea of intermarriage with them must have been altogether repugnant to the Hebrew polity, as indeed we may gather from the book of Ruth], Edomites [Favourably distinguished (Deuteronomy 23:7) from the two preceding races.

Clem. Alex.

But the principle which applied in the case of the seven nations of Canaan applied equally to all other idolaters. \"They will turn away thy son from following me,\" etc. (Deuteronomy 7:4).

It is hardly correct, e.g., to say (as Rawlinson) that the numbers are given in Song of Solomon 6:8 as \"threescore queens and fourscore concubines,\" for it is obvious that too much importance must not be attached to an obiter statement (\"there are threescore,\" etc.) in a poetical book, too, and one descriptive of Solomon's youth. The view of Ewald and Keil, again, that these numbers represent the sum total of the inmates of the harem at different periods of Solomon's long reign, rather than the number present at any one time - they would see in the numbers of Song of Solomon l.c. a statement of the average strength of the seraglio - though not to be described as evasive, is certainly not the natural interpretation of the words. And these numbers, when we compare them with the establishments of other Eastern potentates, are not found to be at all incredible. The commentators all remind us that Dareius Codomannus, e.g., took with him on his expedition against Alexander 360 pellices. Or if ancient history, as Rawlinson affirms, furnishes no strict parallel to these figures, the harems of modern Persia and Turkey at any rate have quite equalled that of Solomon. (See Bahr in loc.)

(The \"sin of Jeroboam\" lay in \"making Israel to sin,\" i.e., in forcing his people into schismatic and unauthorized worship, rather than in any practices of his own.)NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The expressions \"his heart was not perfect,\" below, and \"he went not fully\" (ver. 6) are inconsistent with the idea of idolatry. Similarly Ewald says, \"There is no evidence from ancient authorities that Solomon, even in advanced life, ever left the religion of Jahveh, and with his own hand sacrificed to heathen gods. All traces of contemporary history extant testify to the contrary\" (vol. 3. p. 297). See, however, on ver. 5]: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God [It is instructive to compare with this the words of 1 Kings 8:61, \"Let your heart be perfect,\" etc. Wordsworth remarks that \"the defection even of Solomon from God through the influence of his strange wives is one of the best justifications\" of the commands of Exodus 34:12-16; Deuteronomy 7:2-4, etc.], as was the heart of David his father.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For Solomon went after [Rawlinson observes that this expression, which is \"common in the Pentateuch, always signifies actual idolatry.\" He cites Deuteronomy 11:28; Deuteronomy 13:2; Deuteronomy 28:14; but it should be considered that in the two passages last cited the words are added, \"and served them.\" And the true explanation would seem to be that, though \"it is not stated that Solomon himself offered sacrifice to these idols,\" yet \"even the building of altars for idols was a participation in idolatry, which was irreconcilable with true fidelity to the Lord\" (Keil). Bahr contends that the words \"went after Ashtoreth,\" etc., no more involve personal service than the word \"built\" in ver. 7 involves personal labour; but both expressions show that he regarded these idolatries not only without disfavour, but with positive approval and practical encouragement. \"It is not likely he could be so insensate as to adore such deities, but so far was the uxorious king blinded with affection, that he gave not passage only to the idolatry of his heathenish wives, but furtherance\" (Bp. Hall). And the distinction, so far as the sin is concerned, between this and actual idolatry is a fine one. It is not implied, however, that Solomon ever discarded the worship of Jehovah. To the end of his reign he would seem to have offered his solemn sacrifices on the great altar thrice a year. But his heart was elsewhere (ver. 9).] Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians [עַשְׁתֹּרֶת , Ἀστάρτη, probably connected with ἀστήρ, stella, and star, by some identified with the planet Venus, by others with the moon, is here mentioned for the first time in the singular (Ashtaroth, plural, is found in Genesis 14:5; Judges 2:13; Judges 10:6; 1 Samuel 7:4; 1 Samuel 12:10, etc.) With Baal, she divided the worship of the Phoenicians, the antiquity of which is evident from Genesis 14:5; Numbers 22:41. It was really an impure cultus of the reproductive powers (see below on 1 Kings 14:23). Interesting proof of the existence of a temple of this goddess at Sidon is supplied by an inscription discovered there in 1855 (see Dict. Bib. 1:123) ], and after Milcom [In Jeremiah 49:13; Amos 1:15, \"Malcam,\" i.e., their king. According to Gesenius, the same as Molech (i.e., the king) in ver. 7, though Ewald, Movers, Keil regard them as different deities. But it seems more probable that it was the same deity, worshipped (2 Kings 23:10, 13) under different attributes. This is \"the first direct historical allusion\" to his worship in the Old Testament. A warning against it is found Leviticus 20:2-5. He was the fire god, as Baal was the sun god, and the sacrifices offered to him were those of children, who would seem to have not only \"passed through the fire,\" but to have been burnt therein. Psalm 106:37, 38; Jeremiah 7:31; Jeremiah 19:5; Ezekiel 23:39, etc. See Dict. Bib. 2:403] the abomination [i.e., the hateful, detestable idol] of the Ammonites. [It has been suggested (Speaker's Commentary on Leviticus 20:2) that the children offered to Molech were children of incest or adultery., and we are reminded that Ammon was the child of incest. It must he remembered, however, that we have no record of Jewish children passing through the fire to Molech before the time of Ahaz (Bahr, Keil).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord [cf. Judges 2:11; Judges 3:7, etc.], and went not fully [ללֺא מִלֵא s.c. לֶלֶכֶת.

Gesenius suggests \"Vanquisher\" - Chemosh was the god of war. The mention of Ashtar-Chemosh on the Moabite stone \"connects the Moabite religion with the Phoenician,\" where Ashtar is the masculine form of Astarte, and suggests that \"Chemosh was connected with the androgynous deities of Phoenicia\" (Speaker's Comm. on Numbers 21:29). It is probable, in fact, that Chemosh, Baal, Ashtoreth, Molech, etc., were originally so many names of the one supreme God, worshipped under different attributes, and with various rites in different countries], in the hill that is before Jerusalem [see 2 Kings 23:13. The hill is of course the mount of Olives. The altar would seem to have stood on the south peak, which is now known, as it has been for centuries past, as the Mons Scandali, or the Mons Offensionis (the Vulg. rendering of 2 Kings l.c.) See Robinson, 1:565, 566], and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. [Ewald sees in these altars a wise religious tolerance (\"Hist. Israel,\" 3. pp. 297, 298).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And likewise did he for all [having done it for one, he must needs do it for all. \"No hill about Jerusalem was free from a chapel of devils\" (Hall) ] his strange wives, which burnt [Heb. burning, Ewald, 335 a] incense and sacrificed unto their gods. [Observe, as bearing on the question of Solomon's apostasy, that Solomon built the altars; his wives sacrificed, etc. According to Keil, incense is here mentioned before sacrifice, because vegetable took precedence of animal offerings in the nature worship of Western Asia (Bahr, Symbolik, 2 pp; 237 sqq.) But it is very doubtful whether this idea was in the mind of the writer.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice. [cf. 1 Kings 3:5 and 1 Kings 9:2. The anger arose partly from the exceptional favours which had been shown to him; cf. Amos 3:2; Luke 10:12-15.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And had commanded him concerning this thing [1 Kings 9:6] that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord commanded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon [probably by a prophet, Ahijah or Iddo. There would hardly be a third appearance], Forasmuch as this is done of thee [Heb. this was with thee], and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend [i.e., despite thy great power and magnificence, thy fortifications and munitions of war] the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. [Not merely subject, but officer, employe. This made the decree the more bitter. A \"servant\" should be heir to his glory. For a hireling Solomon's vast treasures had been prepared.

[But for this provision, Jerusalem would have ceased to be the religious capital. When the sceptre departed from Judah, we may be sure that the \"envy of Ephraim\" would have demanded that the city of their solemnities should be placed elsewhere - at Shiloh, which for 400 years had been God's \"bright sanctuary,\" or at Bethel, which from far earlier times had been a holy place. See on 1 Kings 12:29, 32.]NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 11:14-43. SOLOMON'S ADVERSARIES. - As the historian has collected together in chs. 6, 7, 8. all the information he can convey respecting the temple, and in chs. 9, 10. all the scattered notices respecting Solomon's power and greatness, so here he arranges in one section the history of Solomon's adversaries. It must not be supposed that the following records stand in due chronological order. The enmities here mentioned did not date from the delivery of the message of which we have just heard; on the contrary, the hatred and opposition of Hadad and Rezon began at an early period, though not the earliest (1 Kings 5:4), of Solomon's reign. It was only in his later life, however, that they materially affected his position and rule; hence it is that they are brought before us at this stage of the history, and also because they are manifestly regarded as chastisements for Solomon's sin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad [in ver. 17 written Adad, אֲדַד. Apparently this, like Pharaoh, was a title rather than a name. And, like Pharaoh, it is said to mean the sun. It was borne by a king of Edom in very early times, Genesis 25:15; Genesis 36:35, 39 (in the latter verse, as in Genesis 25:15, Hadar is probably a clerical error for Hadad, as the name stands in 1 Chronicles 1:30, 50, ד and ר being so very much alike. Gesenius, however, contends that Hadar is the true reading), and was also a favourite name with the kings of Syria, especially in the forms Benhadad, Hadadezer] the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For it came to pass, when David was in Edom [2 Samuel 8:14. But the text is peculiar. Instead of \"in Edom\" we have \"with Edom,\" את־אדם, unless we take את to be the mark of the accusative, which, however, there is no verb to govern. Keil interprets, \"When David had to do with Edom.\" Bahr refers to 1 Chronicles 20:5, and Genesis 19:4, but they are not strictly parallel, and it is possible that the text is slightly corrupt, as the LXX., Syr., and Arab. must have had בהכות instead of בהיות before them \"when David smote Edom.\" The LXX., e.g., reads ἐν τῷ ἐξολοθρεῦσαι κ.τ.λ. It was only vicariously, however, that David smote Edom, or was in Edom. According to 1 Chronicles 18:12, Abishai slew 18,000 Edomites, while Psalm 60. (title) represents Joab as having slain 12,000 at the same time and place. The two brothers were both in high command, or Abishal may have been detailed by Joab to this service], and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain [The commentators generally are agreed that these are the Israelites slain by the Edomites during an invasion of Israel, and not either the Edomites or Israelites slain in the valley of Salt], after he had smitten [rather, that he smote. This is the apodosis] every male in Edom. [This is, of course, hyperbolical (cf. \"all Israel\" below). It is clear that the whole Edomite nation did not perish. The words point to a terrible slaughter (cf. 1 Chronicles 18:13) among the men of war. Possibly the cruelties of the Edomites (compare Psalm 137:7; Obadiah 1:10-14) had provoked this act of retribution, as to which see Deuteronomy 20:13.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel [i.e., the entire army, as in 1 Kings 16:16, 17], until he had cut off every male in Edom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - That Hadad fled [This word excludes the idea that he was carried off in infancy by servants, something like Joash, 2 Kings 11:2], he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt [cf. Matthew 2:13]; Hadad being yet a little child. [The words used of Solomon 1 Kings 3:7.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And they arose out of Midian [a name of wide and somewhat varied significance. Midian embraces the eastern portion of the peninsula of Sinai (Exodus 2:15, 21; Exodus 3:1), and stretches along the eastern border of Palestine. The term has been compared with our \"Arabia.\" And the indefiniteness arises in both instances from the same cause, viz., that the country was almost entirely desert. Midian would thus extend along the back or east of Edom. There is no need, consequently (with Thenius), to read מָעון i.e., their dwelling. It is noticeable, however, that the LXX. reads ἐκ τῆς πόλεως Μαδμὶμ, and some of the geographers do mention a city of that name on the eastern shore of the Elanitic gulf], and came to Paran [Elsewhere Mount Paran, Habakkuk 3:3; Deuteronomy 33:2; a desert and mountainous tract lying between Arabia Petraea, Palestine, and Idumaea (see Numbers 10:12; Numbers 13:3, 27; 1 Samuel 25:1; Deuteronomy 1:1), and comprehending the desert of Et Tih. It is difficult to identify it with greater precision, but it has been connected with the beautiful Wady Feiran, near Mount Serbal, in the Sinaitic range, which would agree fairly well with our narrative]: and they took men with them out of Pavan [as guides through the desert, and possibly as a protection also], and came to Egypt [The direct route from Edom to Egypt would be across the desert of Et Tih - practically the route of the caravan of pilgrims from Mecca. But this does not settle the position of Paran, as the text seems to hint that the fugitives did not proceed direct from Edom. They may have taken refuge in the first instance amongst the tribes of Midian; or they may have diverged from the straight course through fear], unto Pharaoh king of Egypt [This cannot have been the Pharaoh who was Solomon's father-in-law, for in the first place, the flight was in the time of David, and secondly, a prince who had aided and abetted these fugitives would hardly be likely to form an alliance with their great enemy. It may have been Psusennes II.]; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals [i.e., certain cities or officers were charged with his maintenance, though, as his relations with the royal family were so extremely intimate (vers. 19-22), he may have been fed from the royal table], and gave him land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes [LXX. θεκεμίνα. \"No name that has any near resemblance to either Tahpenes or Thekemina has yet been found among those of the period\" (Poole, Dict. Bib. 3:1431). Rawlinson adds that the monuments of that age are extremely scanty] the queen. [Heb. גְּבִירָה the word generally used of the queen mother (as in 1 Kings 15:13).

The weaning, which generally took place in the second, sometimes third, (2 Macc. 7:27) year,was clearly a much more marked occasion in the ancient East than it is among ourselves (Genesis 21:8; 1 Samuel 1:24) ]: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. [i.e. he was brought up in the Egyptian harem.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead [It comes out very significantly here what a name of terror Joab's had been in Edom and how deep was the impression which his bloody vengeance of a quarter of a century before had made] Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart [Heb. send me away], that I may go to mine own country. [Rawlinson cites Herod. 3:132-137; 5:25, 35, 106, 107, to show that refugees at Oriental courts must obtain permission to leave them.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country?

[The natural inquiry of Eastern courtesy.] And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. [Heb. thou shalt surely send me away. Rawlinson says, \"There is a remarkable abruptness in this termination.\" But we must remember how unfinished, to our eyes, Scripture narratives constantly seem. There is no need, consequently, to suspect any accidental omission from the Hebrew text. The LXX., it is true, adds, \"and Ader departed,\" etc., but this may be inferred from vers. 14, 25. And Hadad's persistent desire to depart, for which he assigns no reason, is suggestive of the thoughts which were stirring in his soul. \"The keen remembrance of his native land, his lost kingdom, and the slaughter of all his house, gathered strength within him; and all the ease and princely honour which he enjoyed in Egypt availed not against the claims of ambition, vengeance, and patriotism\" (Kitto).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And God stirred him up another adversary [almost identical with ver. 14], Rezon the son of Eliadah [Often identified with the Hezion of 1 Kings 15:18, but on insufficient grounds. Whether he was a usurper, who had dethroned Hadad (see Jos., Ant., 6:05. 2), or an officer of Hadadezer's, who escaped either before or after the battle of 2 Samuel 8:3-5, is uncertain. The following words agree equally well with either supposition], which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band [either of rebels before or of fugitives after the defeat], when David slew them of Zobah [Of Zobah, not in Hebrews \"Them\" must mean the Syrian army]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein [As David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus (2 Samuel 8:6), this must have been some time after the defeat of the Syrians. But Keil argues that it cannot have been in the middle or later part of Solomon's reign, inasmuch as Solomon must have been lord of Damascus, or he could not have built Palmyra. But it is not so incontrovertibly settled that Solomon did build Palmyra (see on 1 Kings 9:18) as to make this argument of much weight. And even if it were, we might still fix the reign of Rezon at an earlier period of Solomon's sway. See below], and reigned. [i.e., the band or troop of Rezon, either in the confusion of the defeat, or in some subsequent time of anarchy, took possession of Damascus, and he, it would seem, usurped the crown. The word \"reigned,\" however (plural), is somewhat remarkable. It may perhaps be accounted for by the plurals which precede it. The insertion of one \"yod\" (וימליכו for וימלכו) gives the sense \"they made him king,\" which would certainly be preferable, if the emendation were not purely conjectural.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon [We are not compelled, however, to believe that his reign lasted \"all the days of Solomon.\" This last expression is to be taken with considerable latitude. It is an Orientalism. At the time of 1 Kings 5:4, neither Hadad nor Rezon was giving Solomon any trouble], beside the mischief which Hadad did [Heb. omits did. The construction of the Hebrew (see Ewald, 277d (2), 292b, note) is difficult. Literally, and with the evil which Hadad,\" etc. (comp. ver. 1 of this chapter, \"and with the daughter,\" etc., with Exodus 1:14, Hebrews) The LXX. reconstructs the text, making the following words, \"and he abhorred,\" etc., apply to Hadad; and altering Syria (ארם) into Eden (אסם) to suit. But it is far better to understand עָשה (with our Authorized Version); i.e., beside the mischief which Hadad did (or, \"beside the mischief of Hadad,\" Ewald). \"And he (Rezon) abhorred,\" etc. Hadad's enmity has already been described (vers. 17-22), and the historian has passed on to the case of Rezon. It is extremely unlikely that he should now suddenly recur exclusively to Hadad. It is very natural for him, on the other hand, in his account of Rezon, to remind us that all this was in addition to the mischief wrought by Hadad]: and he abhorred [Heb. loathed] Israel, and reigned over Syria.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And Jeroboam [Viewed in the light of their history, the names Jeroboam and Rehoboam are both instructive. The first means, \"Whose people are many;\" the second, \"Enlarger of the people.\" The latter might almost have been bestowed in irony, the former by way of parody] the son of Nebat [The case of Jeroboam is now related at much greater length, not so much because of the importance of the rebellion at the time, as because of its bearing on the later history of Israel. It led to the disruption of the kingdom and the schism in the Church. It was the first great symptom of the decadence of the power of Solomon; of his decline in piety we have had many indications. We see in it an indication that the Hebrew commonwealth has passed its zenith], an Ephrathite [i.e., Ephraimite; cf. Judges 12:5; 1 Samuel 1:1. Ephraim was the ancient rival of Judah, and by reason of its numbers, position, etc., might well aspire to the headship of the tribes (Genesis 49:26; Genesis 48:19; Deuteronomy 33:17; Joshua 17:17) ] of Zereda [Mentioned here only, unless it is identical with Zeredathah (2 Chronicles 4:17) or Zarthan (Joshua 3:16; 1 Kings 4:12) in the Jordan valley. That this place was apparently situate in the tribe of Manasseh, is no argument against the identification (Bahr), for an Ephrathite might surely be born out of Ephraim. It is, however, observable that Zereda has the definite article (similarly ἡ Σαρείρα ιν the LXX., but this place is located in Mount Ephraim), which Zarthan, etc., have not. Hence it is probably the same as the Zererath of Judges 7:22. In fact, some MSS. read צְרֵדָה there instead of צְרֵרָה and ר and ד are not only etymologically interchangeable, but are also extremely liable to be confused (see above on ver. 14) ], Solomon's servant [i.e., officer; cf. ver. 28], whose mother's name was Zeruah [i.e., leprous. His mother's name is recorded, probably because his father, having died early, was comparatively unknown. But it is not impossible that the similarity either with Zeruiah (cf. 1 Kings 1:7) or Zererah had something to do with its preservation. The people would not readily forget that Solomon's other great adversary was the son of Zeruiah. And we have many proofs how much the Jews affected the jingle of similar words], even he lifted up his [Heb. a] hand [i.e., rebelled. Synonymous expression 2 Samuel 18:28; 2 Samuel 20:21.

We have elsewhere suggested that this was the breach in the line of circumvallation, caused by the Tyropsson valley, and that the Millo was the bank, or rampart which closed it. And to this view the words of the text lend some confirmation] of the city of David his father. [As Millo was built about the 25th year of Solomon's reign (ch. 9:15), we are enabled to fix approximately the date of Jeroboam's rebellion.

[The tribe of Ephraim, with its constant envy of Judah, must have been mortified to find themselves employed - though it was but in the modified service of Israelites - on the fortifications of Jerusalem.

It was probably identical in shape, etc., with the camel's-hair burnous, or abba, worn by the Arabs at the present day (cf. Conder, pp. 318, 342), and being almost a square would lend itself well to division into twelve parts]; and they two were alone in the field [i.e., open country.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And Ahijah caught [This English word almost implies that it was Jeroboam's garment (cf.

He further states that in point of fact the kingdom of Jeroboam only consisted of nine tribes, that of Simeon being practically surrounded by the territory of Judah, and so becoming incorporated in the southern kingdom. But surely, if that had been the idea in the prophet's mind, it would have been better expressed had he torn off one piece from the garment and given the rest, undivided, to Jeroboam (Bahr). And the reference to the number of the tribes is unmistakable. As to Simeon, we have no means of knowing what part that tribe, if it still existed, took at the division of the kingdom. See on 1 Kings 19:3. Its members had long been scattered (Genesis 49:7), and it gradually dwindled away, and has already disappeared from the history.

They might be regarded as in some sense one, inasmuch as they enclosed the Holy City (Seb. Schmidt), the line of division passing right through the temple platform.

Keil would explain it by 2 Samuel 21:17; but 2 Samuel 14:7, \"my coal which is left,\" appears to be a closer parallel. The idea is not that of a home (Rawlinson), but family, issue.

They rather mean, \"as king, all thy desires shall be gratified\" (cf. Deuteronomy 12:20; Deuteronomy 14:26; 1 Samuel 2:16; 2 Samuel 3:21). Bahr paraphrases \"thou shalt have the dominion thou now strivest for,\" but we have absolutely no proof that Jeroboam at that time had ever meditated rebellion.

Cf. Psalm 89:28, 33, 36. This limitation, \"not forever.\" would seem to apply to the kingdom, for it was through the loss of their kingdom that the seed of David was afflicted. And if so, it promises, if not a restoration of the kingdom to the house of David, at any rate a renewal or continuance of God's favour. We may perhaps regard the promise as fulfilled in the subsequent history of the kings of Judah. Not only did the kingdom last for nearly 500 years, but the royal house of David maintained its position to the time of Zerubbabel. Nor is it to be overlooked that He \"of whose kingdom there shall be no end\" (Luke 1:33) was the son of David].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings11:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSolomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Solomon sought the efore to kill Jeroboam. [It is often assumed that Solomon's attempt on Jeroboam's life was the result of the prophecy of Ahijah. And our translation with its \"therefore\" favours this view. The Hebrews, however, has simply \"and Solomon sought,\" etc. And these words connect themselves with ver. 26, \"even he lifted up his hand,\" etc. With ver. 27 a parenthesis begins, explaining how it came about that Jeroboam rebelled. It is implied distinctly that it was because of Ahijah's prophecy. That prophecy, however, was in no sense a justification of treason or attack on Jeroboam's part. The fact that God had revealed His purposes was no reason why Jeroboam should forestall them. David knew and others knew that he was destined to be king, but he piously left it for God, in His own time and way, to place him on the throne. And Jeroboam's rebellion is the more inexcusable, because Ahijah had expressly stated that Solomon was to retain the kingdom during his lifetime. However \"he lifted up his hand;\" there was some overt act of rebellion, and Solomon, because of this, and not because of the prophecy (of which, indeed, he may never have heard), sought to slay him. Nor was the king without justification in so doing. Treason must be promptly suppressed, and treason against a benefactor (see ver. 28) is doubly hateful.] And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt [cf. verse 17, and Matthew 2:13. It was the natural place of refuge], unto Shishak, king of Egypt [Shishak is beyond doubt the Sheshonk I. of the monuments, and is the first of the Pharaohs who can be identified with certainty (see Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1288). The date of his accession appears to be somewhere between 988 and 980 B.C. As to his invasion of Palestine, see on 1 Kings 14:25. His reception of Jeroboam almost proves that there has been a change of dynasty, and that the new Pharaoh was no friend to Solomon], and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.

It is somewhat remarkable, but affords no just ground for suspicion, that each of the first three kings of Israel should have reigned just forty years. \"Such numerical coincidences occur in exact history.

The name possibly indicates Solomon's ambitious hopes respecting him. The irony of history alone emphasizes it. Ecclesiastes 2:18, 19 would seem to show that Solomon himself had misgivings as to his son's abilities. \"As the greatest persons cannot give themselves children, so the wisest cannot give their children wisdom\" (Hall). His mother was Naamah, an Ammonitess (1 Kings 14:31). It would appear from 1 Kings 14:21, and 2 Chronicles 12:13, that he was 41 years of age at his accession. But this is, to say the least, doubtful. ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) he is described in 2 Chronicles 13:7 as being \"young (נַעַר) and tender hearted.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The LXX. addition to 1 Kings 12:24 says he was sixteen; υἱὸς ω}ν ἑκκαίδεκα ἐτῶν ἐν τῶ βασιλεύειν αὐτὸν.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It is hardly probable that Solomon, who was himself \"young and tender\" at his father's death, should then have had a son a year old.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Rehoboam's counsellors, who had \"grown up with him,\" and were therefore of the same age as himself, are called \"lads\" (יְלָדִים, LXX. παισάρια). To these reasons Rawlinson adds a fifth, viz. \"that it is hardly likely that David would have permitted his son to marry an Ammonitess, which of course he must have done, if Rehoboam was born in his lifetime. But it should be remembered that David had himself married a foreign princess, Maachah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (1 Chronicles 3:2). There is greater force in the remark that Solomon's marriages with Ammonite and Moabite women belong apparently to a later period of his life (1 Kings 11:1). Altogether the evidence seems to point to a corruption of the text of 1 Kings 14:21, etc., and it has been suggested that \"forty-one\" is there an error of transcription for \"twenty-one,\" a mistake easily made, if, as is extremely probable, the ancient Hebrews, like the later, used the letters of the alphabet as numerals. Twenty-one would then be כא; forty-one מא] went to [This journey was probably made soon after a prior coronation at Jerusalem. According to the LXX. addition, it was at least a year after his accession] Shechem [An old gathering place of the northern tribes (Joshua 24:1). Its position, in the very centre of Palestine, fitted it for this purpose. (\"Shechem may be considered the natural capital of Palestine,\" Conder, p. 16.) But it was perhaps primarily selected because it was the capital of Ephraim, not because it was a \"national sanctuary of Israel\" (Wordsworth), a title to which it has but little claim. It had once before furnished Ephraim with a king (Judges 9:2). We learn from Joshua 20:7 that it was \"in Mount Ephraim;\" from Judges 9:7 that it was under Mount Gerizim. To its position the place was, no doubt, indebted for its name. It is often said to be doubtful whether the place was named after Shechem, the son of Hamor (Genesis 33:18), or whether this prince took his name from the place. The latter is, no doubt, the correct view. For Shechem means strictly, not, as it is often translated, the \"shoulder,\" but dorsi pars superior, or perhaps the space between the shoulder blades (as is proved by Job 31:22, \"Let my shoulder fall,\" משִּׁכְמָה). Hence the word is found only in the singular (see Gesen., Thessalonians 3. p. 1407). Now any one who has seen the vale of Shechem (Nablus) will hardly doubt that its name is due to its resemblance to this part of the body (compare \"Ezion-geber,\" 1 Kings 9:26). The town lies in a valley between the two ridges of Ebal and Gerizim; cf. Jos., Ant. 4:08. 44. \"The feet of these mountains where they rise from the town [to the height of 1000 feet] are not more than 500 yards apart.\" It is consequently one of the most striking and beautiful spots in Palestine, and the more so as its perennial supply of water clothes it with perpetual verdure. For its history see Genesis 12:6; Genesis 33:18; Genesis 34; Genesis 48:22; Deuteronomy 27:4-12; Joshua 20:7; Joshua 21:20; Joshua 24:1, 25, 32; Judges 9; etc. In the New Testament it has been supposed to appear under the form Sychar (John 4:5), and this variation has been universally accounted for as a paronomasia, ֶשקֶר meaning \"a lie.\" But the recent survey has given us good reasons for identifying the place last named with 'Askar, a little village on the slope of Ebal, half a mile from Jacob's well and a little over a mile from Nablus (Condor, pp. 40, 41) ]: for [This word suggests that Rehoboam had not \"selected the capital of Ephraim to be the scene\" of his coronation (Rawl.) but that he went thither because the northern tribes claimed this concession.

It was a recognition of the importance of the tribe, and there they could the better urge their demands] all Israel [That is, not the twelve tribes (Ewald), but the ten, or their representatives. The name of Israel was already identified with the ten, or rather eleven, tribes (see 2 Samuel 2:9, 10, 17, 28). It is highly probable that the comparative isolation of Judah from the rest of the tribes (see Dict. Bib. vol. 1. p. 1157) had led to this result. Indeed, this fact - that the term \"Israel\" was used of the whole nation, exclusive of the tribe of Judah - shows in a very significant way the alienation of Judah from the rest] were come to Shoehorn to make him king. [It would certainly seem from these words as if the ten tribes had then no settled idea of revolting. Kimchi sees in the very selection of Shechem a proof that they were only \"seeking an opportunity for transferring the government to Jeroboam.\" Similarly Keil. But the glories of Solomon's reign and the traditions of the house of David would surely make them hesitate, even if they had heard of the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite (1 Kings 11:29), before they wantonly broke away from Rehoboam. And the text says expressly that they had assembled to \"make him king,\" i.e., to accept him as such, to anoint him (1 Chronicles 12:38 compared with 2 Samuel 2:4; 2 Samuel 5:8 shows that הִמְלִיך is synonymous with מָשַׁך לְמֶלֶך, Keil), after the example of Saul (1 Samuel 2:15), David (2 Samuel 2:4; 2 Samuel 5:3), and Solomon (ch. 1:39; 1 Chronicles 29:22). No doubt, as the context shows, they intended to stipulate for an alleviation of burdens, etc., and their selection of Shechem as the place where they would render their allegiance was a \"significant hint\" (Ewald. \"The very place puts Israel in mind of a rebellion,\" Bp. Hall) to Rehoboam. Their putting forward Jeroboam as their spokesman -presuming for the present that the received text of ver. 3 is to be retained, as to which, however, see below - was a further hint, or rather a plain indication, that they did not mean to be trifled with. It is not a proof, however, as Keil maintains, that they had already determined to make the latter king, for they distinctly said to Rehoboam (ver. 4), \"Grant our petition and we will serve thee.\" (Ewald, who says \"they had the fullest intentions of confirming his power as king if their wishes were granted,\" points out how this fact makes against the received text, according to which they had already summoned Jeroboam from Egypt.) It is clear from this and the passages cited above that the Jewish people at this period of their history were accustomed, not indeed to choose their king, but to confirm him in his office by public acclamation.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat [see on 1 Kings 11:26], who was yet in Egypt [The usual, and indeed the necessary, interpretation, if we retain our present Hebrew text, is that these words refer, not as the context would lead us to suppose, to the time indicated in vers. 1, 3, etc., but to the time of Solomon's death. But see below], heard of it [The words \"of it,\" though not in the original, are a fair and legitimate interpretation of its meaning. Whether they are retained or not, the natural and grammatical interpretation is that it was the visit to Shechem, just before mentioned, of which Jeroboam heard. But according to our received text, Jeroboam was one of the deputation which met king Rehoboam at Shechem. It has been found necessary, consequently, to understand the words of the death of Solomon, which has been related in 1 Kings 11:43. So the Vulgate, Audita morte ejus. Similarly the LXX. Cod. Vat. inserts the substance of this verse as part of 1 Kings 11:43. (The Cod. Alex. follows the Hebrew.) But this interpretation is surely strained and unnatural] (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) [The parallel passage in 2 Chronicles 10. has here, \"And Jeroboam returned from Egypt\" (ויַָּשבָ יר ממצ instead of וַיֵּשֶׁב יר במצ). And as some copies of the LXX. have καὶ ἐπέστρεψεν Ἱερο βοὰμ ἐξ Αἰγύπτου and the Vulgate has \"Reversus est de Aegypto,\" Dathe, Bahr, al. would adopt this reading here. It is true it involves but a slight change, and it may simplify the construction. But no change is really required, Bahr's objection, that in the text, as it stands, we have an unmeaning repetition, \"He was still in Egypt... and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt,\" loses all its force if we understand Jeroboam to have continued his residence in Egypt (as the LXX. says he did) after hearing of Solomon's death. until summoned by the tribes to be their leader. In any case the repetition accords with Hebrew usage.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they sent and called him.

And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came [It has been held that this verse is largely an interpolation. The LXX. Cod. Vat. has simply, \"And the people spake unto king Rehoboam, saying.\" Of more importance, however, is the fact that it is at direct variance with ver. 20, which places the appearance of Jeroboam on the scene after the revolt of the tribes. Indeed, these two verses can only be brought into agreement by the questionable device of understanding the \"all Israel\" of ver. 20 very differently from the same expression in ver. 1. If, however, we follow in this instance the LXX., which omits the name of Jeroboam both here and in ver. 12 (and which thereby implies that he was not one of the deputation to Rehoboam, but, as ver. 2 states, was at that time still in Egypt), the difficulty vanishes. Ver. 20 then becomes the natural and logical continuation of vers. 2, 3. \"And Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt. And they sent and called him [to the country.]... And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again [at their summons] they sent and called him unto the congregation,\" etc. And in favour of the omission of Jeroboam's name is the fact that the Hebrew text, both in ver. 3 and in ver. 12, betrays some little confusion. In ver. 3, the Cethib has וַיָּבֹאוּ and וַיָּבֹוּ in ver. 12, whereas the Keri has וַיָּבֹא in both cases.

Was this complaint a just one? It is one which occasions us some surprise, as the reign of Solomon had not only been glorious, but the people had apparently enjoyed the greatest plenty and prosperity (1 Kings 4:20, 25; cf. 8:66). Bishop Hall, Bahr, and other writers, consequently, who see in the fact that the ten tribes had chosen Jeroboam for their mouthpiece a settled determination on their part to revolt, affirm that their grievances were purely factitious. But we must not forget that, despite the unbroken peace (see Hall, \"Contempl.\" 2:136) and general prosperity and affluence, the people had had one burden at least to bear which is always galling and vexatious, the burden of a conscription. It is by no means certain, though it is constantly assumed, and is not in itself improbable, that the taxes and imposts had been heavy, the passages alleged in support of that view (1 Kings 10:15, 25; 1 Kings 12:4, LXX.) being quite inconclusive. But while we have no right to speak of the, enormous exactions of the late king\" (Stanley), we may be perfectly sure that such an establishment as his (1 Kings 4:22, 26) and such undertakings (1 Kings 6:14, 22; 1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings 7; 1 Kings 9:26, 17, 18) would be extremely costly, and that their cost was not altogether defrayed by the presents of subject princes (1 Kings 4:21; cf. 10:10, 14), the profits of the king's merchants (1 Kings 10:28), or the imports of the fleet (1 Kings 5:21 [1 Kings 5:7]). But the people had certainly had to pay a more odious tribute, that of forced labour, of servile work (1 Kings 4:6, Hebr.; 5:14 [1 Kings 4:34]; cf. 1 Kings 9:21. מַס is almost always used of a tribute rendered by labour, Gesen.) It is quite true that Solomon was not the first to institute this; that David had exacted it before him (2 Samuel 20:24); that the burden was one with which all subjects of the old-world monarchies, especially in the East, were familiar; and that in this case it had been imposed with peculiar considerateness (1 Kings 5:14). But it is none the less certain, when we consider the magnitude of Solomon's undertakings, and the number of men necessarily employed in executing them, that it must have involved some hardships and created much dissatisfaction; such results are inevitable in all conscriptions. \"Forced labour has been amongst the causes leading to insurrection in many ages and countries. It alienated the people of Rome from the last Tarquin; it helped to bring about the French Revolution; and it was for many years one of the principal grievances of the Russian serfs\" (Rawlinson). But we may find instances of its working perhaps as more Eastern, more closely illustrative of the text amongst the Fellahin of Egypt. \"According to Pliny, 360,000 men had to work 20 years long at one pyramid\" (Bahr). In the construction of the great Mahmoudieh canal, by Mehemet All, over 300,000 labourers were employed. They worked under the lash, and such were the fatigues and hardships of their life that many thousands died in the space of a few months (cf., too, Exodus 1:11 sqq.; Exodus 2:23]: now therefore make thou the grievous [Heb. hard, heavy] service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter [lit., \"lighten somewhat from,\" etc.], and we will serve thee. [Their stipulations seem reasonable enough. Bahr, who says, \"We cannot admit the complaint of too hard tribute work to be well founded,\" and Keil, who maintains that \"there cannot have been any well-grounded occasion for complaint,\" surely forget that both the aged counsellors (ver. 7) and also the writer of this book (vers. 13-15) manifest some degree of sympathy with the complainants.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.

It has been assumed that both the old and young advisers of Rehoboam had been taken by him, as part of his retinue, to Shechem (Bahr). But it is quite as likely that some of them were summoned from Jerusalem to advise him, and that the three days' delay was in order to give time for their attendance. It is a long day's journey (12 hours) from Nablus to Jerusalem. Three days, consequently, would just afford sufficient time for the purpose] then come again to me, And the people departed.

He says, \"The king could not become the עֶבֶד of the people without prejudicing the authority entrusted to him by God.\" But they do not propose that he should become their servant, except for one clay, and then only in the sense of making reasonable concessions. What they mean is this: \"If thou wilt brook for once to accede to their terms instead of dictating thine own,\" etc. The form of their answer was probably suggested by the temper of the king. They saw what was passing in his mind, viz., that he would fain play the autocrat, and that he resented it exceedingly that his subjects, just as he had begun to taste the sweets of royalty, should presume to parley with him; and they say in effect, \"You think that they are reversing your relations, that they are making you, their sovereign, their servant. Be it so. It is but for one day. Then they will be your slaves forever\"], and answer them [i.e., favourably; grant their request; cf. Psalm 22:22; Psalm 65:6], and speak good words to them, then will they be thy servants forever.

Green wood is ever shrinking\" (Hall)] that were grown up with him [possibly his companions in the harem], and which stood before him [i.e., as his courtiers and counsellors (cf. ver. 6).

It suggests the idea of retaliation, or that it was a piece of presumption on their part to have spoken at all], saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us [lit., from upon us]; thus shalt thou say unto them [This iteration is expressive of determination and resentment. We may read between the lines, \"I would make short work with them, and teach them a lesson they will not forget\"], My little finger [\"Finger\" is not in the original, but the meaning is indisputable] shall be [or is, עָבָה, strictly, was thicker. The LXX. has simply παχυτέρα] thicker than my father's loins. [A figurative and perhaps proverbial expression. The sense is clear. \"My hand shall be heavier than my father's, my force greater than his, my weakness even stronger than his strength.\" The counsel of the young men is full of flattery, which would be acceptable to a young king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And now whereas my father did lade you with [or, lay upon you] a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips [It is probable that the expression is not entirely figurative. It is quite possible that the levies of Amorites, Hittites (1 Kings 9:20), etc., had been kept at their toils by the lash], but I will chastise you with scorpions. [\"The very words have stings\" (Hall). It is generally held that there is here \"no allusion whatever to the animal, but to some instrument of scourging - unless, indeed, the expression is a mere figure\" (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1161). Perhaps it is safer to understand it as a figure of speech, although the scorpion, unlike the serpent, is little like, or adapted to use as, a lash. Probably it was in the pain the whip caused that the resemblance lay (Romans 9:5). All the commentators mention that the later Romans used a whip called a \"scorpio,\" and cite Isidore (Orig. 5, 27) in proof. Gesenius, Keil, al. understand \"whips with barbed points, like the point of a scorpion's sting;\" the Rabbins, Virgae spinis instructae; others, the thorny stem of the eggplant, by some called the \"scorpion plant.\" Compare our use of the word \"cat.\" \"The yoke and whips go together, and are the signs of labouring service (Ecclus. 30:26, or 33:27)\" Bahr.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - So Jeroboam and [LXX. omits] all the people came to Rehoboam the third day [\"Three days' expectation had warmed these smoking Israelites\" (Hall) ], as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And the king answered the people [the omission of Jeroboam's name, though perhaps it cannot he pressed in argument, is noticeable] roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause [or course of events; lit., turn] was from the Lord [\"Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.\" God did not inspire Rehoboam's proud and despotic reply, but used it for the accomplishment of His purpose, the partition of the kingdom (cf. Exodus 14:4; Matthew 26:24). God makes the wrath of man to praise Him], that [Heb. in order that] he might perform his saying, which the Lord spake by [Heb. in the hand of; cf. 1 Kings 14:18; 1 Kings 2:25, note] Ahijah the Shilonite [see on 1 Kings 11:11] unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered [Heb. brought back word to; probably after some consultation amongst themselves] the king, saying, What portion have we in David? [Same expression as 2 Samuel 20:1. The words, interpreted by this passage and 2 Samuel 19:43, mean, \"Since we have no kindness or fairness from David's seed, what is his house to us? Why render homage to his son? We receive nought from him, why yield aught to him?\"] neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse [i.e., \"his tribe is not ours; his interests are not ours.\" Bahr sees in the expression \"son of Jesse\" \"an allusion to David's humbler descent,\" but surely without reason. It is simply a periphrasis for the sake of the parallelism. The rhythm almost elevates the words to the rank of poetry]: to your tents, O Israel [lit., thy tents, Or dwellings; i.e., \"Disperse to your homes (see 1 Kings 8:66; and cf. 2 Samuel 18:17; 2 Samuel 19:8; 2 Samuel 20:1), and prepare for war.\" לֺאהֶל, which means primarily a \"tent,\" has for its secondary meaning, \"habitation,\" \"home.\" This cry - the Marseillaise of Israel - probably had its origin at a time when the people dwelt in tents, viz., in the march through the desert (see Joshua 22:4; Numbers 1:52; Numbers 9:18; Numbers 16:26) ]. Now see to thine own house, David [i.e., let the seed of David henceforth reign over the tribe of Judah, if it can. It shall govern the other tribes no longer. \"It is not a threat of war, but a warning against interference\" (Rawlinson). רָאָה has the meaning of \"look after,\" \"care for.\" \"David, the tribe father, is mentioned in place of his family\" (Keil) ]. So Israel departed unto their [lit., his] tents [see note on ch. 8:66].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But as for the children of Israel which dwelt In the cities of Judah [i.e., \"the Israelites proper or members of other tribes, who happened to be settled within the limits of the land of Judah\" (cf. ver. 23). A number of Simeonites were (Rawlinson) certainly among them (Joshua 19:1-9). The term \"children of Israel\" is henceforward to be understood in its restricted sense (see on ver. 1). It cannot include the men of Judah], Rehoboam reigned over them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute [Probably the same officer as the Adoniram of ch. 1 Kings 4:6. For \"Adoram,\" the LXX. and other versions read \"Adoniram\" here. It is curious that a person of the same name, Adoram (LXX. Adoniram), was over David's levy (2 Samuel 20:24). That there was a relationship, and that the office had descended from father to son, can hardly be doubted, but whether two persons or three are indicated it is impossible to say. It is of course just possible, though hardly likely that one and the same person (Ewald) can have been superintendent of servile work under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. It is generally assumed that the young king sent this officer \"to treat with the rebels and to appease them, as Josephus expressly says\" (Bahr). It seems quite as likely that he was sent to coerce them, or to collect the taxes, as a summary way of showing that the king meant to enforce his rights and was not moved by their words. For it is hardly probable that such a proud and headstrong prince as Rehoboam would stoop, especially after the confident threats which he had just uttered, to parley with rebels. Such a man, guided by such counsellors, and inflated with a sense of his own power and importance, would naturally think of force rather than of conciliation or concessions. He would be for trying his whips of scorpions. And if conciliation had been his object, it is hardly likely that he would have employed Adoram, the superintendent of the levy, a man who would naturally be obnoxious to the people, to effect it. Moreover the sequel - Adoram's tragical end - also favours the supposition that he was sent, not \"to arrange some alleviation of their burdens\" (Rawlinson), but to carry out the high-handed policy Of the king]; and all Israel stoned him with stones [\"With one exception, this was a bloodless revolution\" (Stanley). It has been remarked that the practice of stoning is first heard of in the stony desert (Arabia Petraea). But in reality it is older than the date of the Exodus, as Exodus 8:26 shows. And it is an obvious and ready and summary way of despatching obnoxious persons (cf. Exodus 17:4; 1 Samuel 30:6; 1 Kings 21:10). It is to this day a favourite method of the East for testifying hatred and intolerance], that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed [So the LXX., ἔφθασεν. The Hebrew literally means, as margin, \"strengthened himeself.\" But the A.V. gives the practical force of the word. He bestirred himself; he lost no time; the death of Adoram showed him the danger of a moment's delay. \"He saw those stones were thrown at him in his Adoram\" (Hall).] to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - So Israel rebelled [lit., fell away (marg.) The common secondary meaning of the word is to transgress. Its use here may perhaps suggest that their rebellion was not without sin] against the house of David unto this day (see on 1 Kings 8:8)].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again [These words are hardly consistent with the idea that Jeroboam had been from the first the spokesman of \"all Israel\" in their interviews with Rehoboam. If, however, the received text of vers. 8, 12 is retained (see on ver. 3), then we must understand the \"all Israel\" in ver. 1 of the representatives of the different tribes, and here, of the entire nation who had heard from its representatives, on their return to their homes (ver. 16), of the presence of Jeroboam in the country], that they sent and called him unto the congregation [Where and when this gathering was held we are not informed. Probably it was at Shechem, and soon after Rehoboam's flight. After the open and irreparable breach which they had made (ver. 18), the leaders of the tribes would naturally assemble at once to concert measures for their defence and future government], and made him king [by anointing. Note on ver. 1] over all Israel [This public and formal consecration of Jeroboam completed the secession of the northern tribes. Was this secession sinful? Bahr, Keil, and others, who start from the assumption that secession was determined upon even before Rehoboam came to Shechem, and that the complaints of the people respecting the grievous service to which they had been subjected by Solomon were groundless, naturally conclude that it was altogether treasonable and unjustifiable. But is this conclusion borne out by the facts? We may readily admit that the schism was not accomplished without sin: we cannot but allow that Israel acted with undue precipitation, and that Rehoboam, who was \"young and tenderhearted,\" was entitled, for David's and Solomon's sake, as well as his own, to greater forbearance and consideration, and it is almost certain that both the \"envy of Ephraim\" and the ambition of Jeroboam largely influenced the result. At the same time, it is to be remembered that the division of the kingdom was ordained of God, and that the people had just cause of complaint, if not, indeed, sufficient warrant for resistance, in the arbitrary and insolent rejection of their petition by the young king. No law of God requires men to yield themselves up without a struggle to such cruel and abject slavery as Rehoboam threatened these men with. They judged - and who shall say unreasonably? - from his words that they had only tyranny and cruelty to expect at his hands, and what wonder if they stood on their defence? They are only to be blamed because they did more. But lawful resistance not uncommonly ripens into unlawful rebellion]: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. [This general statement is qualified immediately afterwards (ver. 21). The tribe of Benjamin, \"the smallest of the tribes of Israel\" (1 Samuel 9:21), \"little Benjamin\" (Psalm 68:27), is here omitted as of comparatively small account. Exact precision has never characterized Oriental writers. There is no suspicion of untruth: it is the genius of the people toNEWLINENEWLINE\"disdain the lore,NEWLINEOf nicely calculated less and more.\" It may be added here that Edom remained under the sway of Judah until the reign of Jehoram (2 Kings 8:20), just as Moab and other portions of Solomon's empire for a considerable period formed part of the new kingdom of Israel (2 Kings 1:1; 2 Kings 3:4, 5).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah with [Heb. and] the tribe of Benjamin, [It is at first sight somewhat surprising that Benjamin, so long the rival of Judah, and which had so long resisted the rule of David, should on this occasion have detached itself from the leadership of Ephraim, its near and powerful neighbour, and a tribe, too, with which it had a sort of hereditary connexion. That a sort of jealousy existed at one time between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, consequent, no doubt, on the transference of the sceptre from the house of Saul to that of David, is very evident. A thousand men of Benjamin constituted the following of the rebel Shimei, (2 Samuel 19:17). The rising of Sheba the Benjamite, again (2 Samuel 20:1), proves that the enmity and discontent were not even then subdued. But when the ten tribes fell away, Benjamin seems never to have faltered in its allegiance. The change is easily accounted for. It was the glory of Benjamin that Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the civil and religious capital of the nation, was largely within its border. \"The city of the Jebusite\" was in the lot of Benjamin (Joshua 18:28). But it was also on the boundary line of Judah. This fact had, no doubt, brought the two tribes into close contact, and had given them interests in common, in fact had \"riveted them together as by a cramp\" (Blunt, pp. 167, 174, who traces \"a gradual tendency of the ten tribes to become confederate under Ephraim,\" and a growing alliance and community of interests between Judah and Benjamin); and now Benjamin could not fail to see that separation from Judah would mean the loss of Jerusalem (which would be largely peopled by the men of Judah, David's tribe, and would be practically in their hands), while adhesion to Ephraim would not prevent the establishment of another sanctuary further north. The traditions of fifty years, consequently, and the common interest in the capital, prevailed over hereditary ties and ancient feuds, and decided Benjamin to cast in its lot with Judah;the more so, as the heads of this tribe may have felt, after once furnishing Israel with its king, as jealous of Ephraim as they had once been of Judah. It must not be forgotten, however, that some portions of Benjamin, including Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, were incorporated in the northern kingdom (Ewald) ], an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men [the LXX. has ἑκατὸν καὶ ἐὶκοσι = 120,000, but the larger number need create no astonishment. At the time of David's census, the men of Judah numbered - if the figures can be depended on - 500,000, while Abijah could muster some 18 years afterwards an army of 400,000 (2 Chronicles 1 [lit., making war], to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. [It is characteristic of Rehoboam that he proposes forthwith to subdue the rebellious tribes by force. Probably he had no idea to what extent the tribes would prove disloyal.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - But the word of God came unto Shemaiah [This part of the history is probably derived from the \"book\" which this prophet wrote (2 Chronicles 12:15). When Keil describes him as \"a prophet who is not mentioned again,\" he has surely overlooked 2 Chronicles 12:7, 8, where we find him prophesying with reference to the army of Shishak], the man of God [a common expression in the books of Kings. It rarely occurs in the other Scriptures. This designation is not altogether synonymous with \"prophet.\" It is used, for example, of angels (Judges 13:6, 8), of Moses (Deuteronomy 33:1), and of David (2 Chronicles 8:14), and would embrace any minister or servant of God, while נָבִיא is restricted to the teaching order. There were false prophets, but no false men of God. It is also worth considering whether the name of prophet may not have been practically restricted to, or bestowed by preference on, those who had received a prophetic training, the \"sons of the prophets\" who had been taught in the schools. Cf. 1 Samuel 10:5-12; 1 Samuel 19:20; Amos 7:14], saying.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin; and to the remnant of the people [\"the children of Israel\" mentioned in ver. 17, where see note], saying.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

[A prophet of Judah now confirms what a prophet of Israel had already announced]. They hearkened therefore unto the word of the Lord, and returned [not \"because they probably saw that a war with the numerically greater, and just now bitterly excited, ten tribes would bring them into a worse condition still\" (Bahr), but because of the \"word of the Lord.\" It was the remonstrance of the prophet alone restrained them. They knew their numerical inferiority before, but they nevertheless mustered for battle] to depart [a common Hebraism. The phrase in 2 Chronicles 11:4, יָשׁוּבוּ מִלֶּכֶת \"they returned from going,\" was probably designed as an explanation], according to the word of the Lord. At this point the Vat. LXX. inserts along addition, which differs from, and indeed contradicts, the Hebrew text in some important particulars. Rehoboam is represented as 16 years of age (Hebrews 40), as reigning 12 years (Hebrews 17); his mother is Naanan (Heb. Naamah), and is the daughter of Ana, son of Nahash, king of Ammon. Jeroboam is described as son of Sarira, a harlot. He is appointed by Solomon superintendent of the levy of Ephraim, and builds for him a city Sarira, and also completes the circumvallation of Jerusalem. He has 300 chariots and aims at royalty. Solomon seeking to slay him, he flees to Shishak, king of Egypt, who treats him with distinction, giving him the sister of his own wife in marriage. Here his son Abijah is born, when Rehoboam has been, something like a year upon the throne. After his birth, Jeroboam asks a second time to be released: he returns to his own country, takes up his abode at Sarira, fortifies it, and gathers the tribe of Ephraim round him. Here Abijah falls sick, and the visit to the prophet, narrated in chap. 14, takes place. The child dies; there is general mourning, after which Jeroboam goes to Shechem, and collects the tribes. Here the prophet Shemaiah (not Ahijah) tears a new garment in twelve pieces, gives him ten, and promises him the dominion over ten tribes. After which follow the events of vers. 5-24 of this chapter. The great circumstantiality of this narrative has led some scholars - Dean Stanley among them - to prefer it before the Hebrew version. But its details will not bear careful examination, and there is little doubt that it is a compilation of later date. Its untrustworthiness has been well shown among others by Rawlinson, Speaker's Commentary in loc. But he omits to notice what is perhaps its strongest condemnation, viz., that this LXX. addition is in conflict with the LXX. (and Hebrews) text of chap. 11. The account of Jeroboam's marriage with the sister of the queen, e.g., is manifestly a variation of the history of Hadad (ch. 11. ver. 19; see also ver. 22). Nor does it harmonize with the preceding history of this chapter, as given by the LXX.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:25-33. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL, AND THE SCHISM IN THE CHURCH. - The historian, after describing the great rebellion of the Jewish people, proceeds, in the rest of this chapter, to relate the measures which the new king took to secure his position. These were both external and internal. The external means were the erection of fortresses; the internal, the provision of new sanctuaries, priests, and ordinances.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Then Jeroboam built [i.e., rebuilt or fortified, בָּנָה naturally has both meanings] Shechem [see on ver. 1 and on 1 Kings 14:1] in Mount Ephraim [The Har-Ephraim, or mountain district of Ephraim (in Joshua 11:16 called the \"Mountain of Israel;\" cf. Joshua 17:15-18; Judges 4:5; Judges 10:1; 1 Samuel 1:1), is \"the central mass of the hills of Palestine, nearly equidistant from the northern and southern boundary of the whole country\" (Stanley, S. and P., p. 229), and the richest and most beautiful part of the land. \"The tower of Sichem had been burnt down by Abimelech and the tower of Penuel had been destroyed by Gideon, Judges 8:17\" (Keil). The city of Shechem had been destroyed at the same time as the tower, but had no doubt been rebuilt, at least in part, otherwise it could hardly have been selected for Rehoboam's coronation. It was naturally Jeroboam's first care to strengthen his position by fortitying his capital, and the more so as this city would be particularly obnoxious to Rehoboam as the scene of the revolution; but why he should at the same time have rebuilt Penuel - Ewald thinks the seat of government was placed here - is not at first eight so obvious, as it lay beyond the Jordan (Genesis 32:22, 30; Genesis 33:17) and was therefore presumably outside the circle of hostilities, should such arise. Probably it was because this was the gate to his Trans-Jordanic territory. A tower commanding the fords of the Jordan would secure Reuben, Gad, etc., against invasion from Judah. It is also not unlikely that Jeroboam. who was the great castle builder of that age, had some fears of \"hostile attacks from the north and northeast\" (Keil), or thought of \"the caravan road which led over Gilead to Damascus\" (Wordsworth), and of which he would wish, for the sake of his revenue, to retain the control], and dwelt therein [He made it his first residence and capital]; and went out from thence [i.e., when he had secured one fortified city. He could hardly be certain as yet which side some of the tribes would take. It is also possible that some of the workmen who had built Shechem were afterwards employed on the fortification of Penuel], and built Penuel. [Bahr says, \"There is no doubt that he built these fortifications by tribute labour, like Solomon.\" But is this quite so certain? The people after the revolt would naturally conclude that Rehoboam, of whose proud temper they had had such proof, would want to wreak his vengeance on the city which had rejected him, and the instinct of self-defence would lead them at once to rebuild their walls. And the newborn kingdom would also earnestly desire to possess a suitable capital. Thus their self-interest and enthusiasm alike would obviate the necessity for a conscription.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David [It needed much less prescience than Jeroboam seems to have possessed to perceive that fortresses and armies would be of no avail for the defence of his realm, so long as Jerusalem remained the one sanctuary of the land. He clearly foresaw that if the people went up thither, as in time past, three times a year, to keep the feasts, the religious sentiment would in time reassert itself and sweep him and his new dynasty away. With one religion, one sanctuary, one priesthood, there could not long be two kingdoms. People who had so much in common would, sooner or later, complete the unity of their national life under a common sovereign. And we find, indeed, that so powerful were the attractions of the temple, and the religious system of which it was the centre, that \"the priests and Levites that were in all Israel,\" together with the more devout laity, fell away to Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:13, 16), while the speech of Abijah on Mount Zemaraim (2 Chronicles 13:11), proves that others as well as Jeroboam were well aware that the old religion and the new kingdom could hardly coexist.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - If this people go up to do sacrifice [Heb. sacrifices] in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem [as the law of Moses ordained (Deuteronomy 12:11, 14; Deuteronomy 16:6, 11)], then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord [The Syriac omits this word. The LXX. has πρὸς Κύριον κὰι κύριον αὐτῶν], even unto Rehoboam king of Judah [When Wordsworth remarks that Jeroboam \"here acknowledges Rehoboam as the 'lord' of the people,\" he surely forgets that these are not the actual words of Jeroboam, but the thoughts which the historian supposes him to have had (ver. 26) ], and they shall kill me [as they would do, if they wished to return to Rehoboam's rule. Their first offering would be the head of the usurper, 2 Samuel 20:20, 21; cf. 2 Samuel 4:7], and go again [lit., turn again, same word as above] to Rehoboam king of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Whereupon the king took counsel [\"With his counsellors, or the heads of the nation who had helped him to the throne\" (Keil). Bahr understands, \"he reflected about it alone\" (et excogitato consilio, Vulgate), alleging that so important a circumstance as the concurrence of the heads of the people in changing the system of worship would not have been passed over in silence. But while the text does not perhaps imply any formal deliberation with the elders, it is reasonable to suppose that Jeroboam, who owed his position to popular election, and who was far too sagacious not to follow the example of Rehoboam (vers. 6, 9), would summon others to advise him as to this critical and momentous step. Wordsworth refers to Isaiah 30:1, and says that \"Jeroboam is the image and pattern of Machiavellian politicians.\" \"Next to Ahithophel, I do not find that Israel yielded a craftier head than Jeroboam's\" (Hall)], and made two calves [It is generally held that these were in imitation of, or were suggested by, the \"golden calf\" of Aaron (Exodus 32:2), and the close resemblance of Jeroboam's words (below), in inaugurating this new cultus, to Aaron's have been thought to prove it. But surely it has been overlooked that Jeroboam could hardly be so shortsighted and unwise as deliberately to reintroduce a worship which had provoked the \"fierce wrath\" (ver. 12) of God, and had nearly resulted in the extermination of the Jewish race. For of course neither Jeroboam nor his people could have forgotten the stern condemnation which Aaron's calf worship had received. The molten image ground to powder, the ashes mixed in the drink of the people, the slaughter of three thousand worshippers, etc., would assuredly have lived in the memories of the nation. A more impolitic step, consequently - one more certain to precipitate his ruin, by driving the whole nation into the arms of Judah - Jeroboam could not have taken, than to attempt any revival or imitation of the forbidden cultus of the desert. And it is as little likely that the worship of the calves was derived from the worship of Apis, as practised at Memphis, or of \"Mnevis, the sacred calf of Heliopolis\" (Stanley), though with both of these Jeroboam had recently been in contact. It would have been but a sorry recommendation in the eyes of Israel that the first act of the new king should be to introduce the hateful idolatry of Egypt into the land; and every consideration tends to show that the calf worship was not, and was not intended to be, idolatry, such as the worship of Egypt undoubtedly was. It is always carefully distinguished from idol worship by the historians and prophets. And the idea which Jeroboam wished to give his subjects was clearly this that, so far from introducing new gods or new sanctuaries, he was merely accommodating the old worship to the new state of things. He evidently felt that what he and his house had most to fear was, not the armies of Rehoboam but the ritual and religious associations of Jerusalem. His object, if he were wise, must therefore be to provide a substitute, a counterfeit worship. \"I will give you,\" he virtually says, \"at Bethel and Dan, old sanctuaries of our race long before Jerusalem usurped their place, those visible emblems of the heavenly powers such as are now found only in the temple. You too shall possess those mysterious forms which symbolize the Invisible, but you shall have them nearer home and easier of access.\" There can be little doubt, consequently, that the \"calves\" were imitations of the colossal cherubim of Solomon's temple, in which the ox or calf was probably the forma praecipua (1 Kings 6:23).] of gold [Hardly of solid gold. Possibly cf. wood covered with gold plates, i.e., similar to the cherubim (1 Kings 6:23-28); probably of molten brass (see 1 Kings 14:9, and cf. Psalm 106:19), overlaid with gold; such images, in fact, as are described in Isaiah 40:19], and said unto them, It is too much for you [This translation, pace Keil, cannot be maintained. Nor can it be said that \"the exact meaning of the original is doubtful\" (Rawlinson), for a study of the passages where this phrase, רַב־לָכֶם occurs (see, e.g., Deuteronomy 1:6; Deuteronomy 2:3; Deuteronomy 3:26; and cf. Genesis 45:28; Exodus 9:28; 2 Samuel 24:16; 1 Kings 19:4) will convince the reader that it must be rendered here, \"It is enough\" - i.e., \"you have gone long enough to a city which only owes its present position to the ambition of the tribe of Judah, and which is a standing testimony to your own inferiority; henceforth, desist.\" We have an exact parallel in Ezekiel 44:6; where the Authorized Version renders, \"Let it suffice you.\" The LXX. supports this view by rendering ἱκανόυσθω ὑμῖν throughout. Vulgate, nolite ultra ascendere, etc.] to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods [rather \"god,\" for Jeroboam had no idea of introducing polytheism. It is true he made two calves because of his two sanctuaries, but each was designed to represent the same object - the one God of Israel. The word is translated, gods\" in Exodus 32:1, 4, 8, 23, 31; but as the reference is in every case to the one calf, it should be translated \"god\" there also. In Nehemiah's citation of the words (Nehemiah 9:18), the word is unmistakably singular. \"This is thy god,\" etc. The words are not \"exactly the same as the people used when setting up the golden calf\" (Bahr). Jeroboam says, \"Behold,\" etc.], O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. [It is at first sight somewhat difficult to resist the view, which is generally entertained, that Jeroboam, of set purpose, cited the ipsissima verba of the Israelites in the desert (Exodus 32:4). But a little reflection will show that it is much more difficult to believe that a monarch, circumstanced as Jeroboam was, could at the very outset of his career have acted in the teeth of history, and have committed the gross blunder, not to say wanton outrage, of deliberately connecting his new cult with the calf worship of the desert. He can hardly have dared, that is, to say, \"This is no new religion, for this very form of worship our fathers used formerly in the desert, under the guidance of Aaron himself\" (Seb. Schmidt, followed by Keil, al.) unless both he and his people alike - which is inconceivable - were ignorant of their nation's history recorded in Exodus 32:19-35. It has been argued by some that this action of Jeroboam and the ready compliance of the ten tribes, prove that the Pentateuch cannot then have been written. But, as Hengstenberg (cited by Wordsworth) rejoins, the same argument would lead to the conclusion that the Bible could not have been written in the dark ages, or, we might add, even at the present day. He can hardly have claimed, that is to say, to be reintroducing the calf worship, which God had so emphatically reprobated, unless he designed an open defiance of the Most High, and wished to shock all the religious instincts and convictions of his people. It is much more natural, consequently, to suppose, considering the very frequent recurrence, though sometimes in slightly different shapes, of the formula \"the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 20:2; Exodus 29:45, 46; Leviticus 19:36; Leviticus 23:43; Leviticus 25:38; Leviticus 26:13, 45; Numbers 15:41; Numbers 16:13; Numbers 20:16; Deuteronomy 5:6, 15; Deuteronomy 6:12; Deuteronomy 8:14; Deuteronomy 9:26; Joshua 24:6, 17; Judges 6:8; 1 Samuel 8:8; 1 Samuel 10:18; 1 Kings 8:21, etc.) that the correspondence is accidental, the more so as Jeroboam does not quote the exact words, and that he has used a phrase which was constantly in their ears, insisting thereby that his calves were emblems of the God of their race, the God whose great glory it was that He had taken their nation out of the midst of another nation, etc. (Deuteronomy 4:34), and delivered them from a thraldom with which, perhaps, the tyranny of Rehoboam is indirectly compared. Or it there was any reference to the golden calf, it must have been depreciatory, as if to say,\" That was rank idolatry, and as such it was punished. That calf was an image of Apis. My calves are cherubic symbols, symbols such as He has Himself appointed, of the Great Deliverer of our race. Behold thy God, which really brought thee up,\" etc.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Daniel [Two considerations seem to have influenced Jeroboam in his choice of these sites. First, both these places were in some sort sanctuaries already. Bethel was already a makom, or holy place, in the days of Abraham; was consecrated by the visions and altar of Jacob (Genesis 28:11-19; Genesis 31:13; Genesis 35:1, 7, 15), and by the ark having been there (Judges 20:26-28, Hebrews; cf. Jos., Ant., 5:02.10). And though Dan (Joshua 19:47; Judges 18:29; Judges 20:1) can hardly have had as sacred a character as the \"house of God and the gate of heaven\" (Genesis 28:17) had, still it had its shrine and its schismatic priesthood. A grandson of Moses (Judges 18:13, true reading) had ministered there, and his sons were the priests of Dan still. Secondly, these localities would suit the convenience of his subjects, being respectively at the southern and northern extremities of the kingdom. And this, no doubt, was one reason why Dan was chosen in preference to other places, such as Shiloh, which, though more sacred, were less conveniently situated. A sanctuary at Dan would save the northern tribes many tedious journeys. It should be remarked that Bethel properly belonged to Benjamin (Joshua 18:13, 22), though it was also on the border of Ephraim; and it has been suggested that it was Jeroboam's selection of this place as a seat of the calf worship decided the tribe of Benjamin to follow the lead of Judah. But the narrative seems to imply that their choice had been made at an earlier period (ver. 21), and the city would seem to have been long in the possession of the house of Joseph (Judges 1:22). It is now known as Beitin, and is one of the most naked and dreary spots in Palestine. \"The place seems, as it were, turned to stone; and we can well imagine that the patriarch found nothing softer than a stone for his pillow.\" Conder, p. 252, who suggests that from the time of Abraham Bethel was a מָקום, a sacred place merely (Genesis 28:11), and distinct from the adjoining city of Luz (ver. 19).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And this thing became a sin [It was in itself sinful, for it both set at nought the express prohibition of the Decalogue (Exodus 20:4), and also disregarded the one sanctuary of God's choice (Deuteronomy 12:5). And it led to other sins, e.g., the intrusion of a schismatic and irregular priesthood, and the performance of unauthorized rites, and to \"an ever-deepening corruption of the national faith\" (Ewald). Cf. Hosea 8:5; Hosea 13:2. But the meaning is, it became an occasion of sin to the people (\"Quod fuit postea causa gravissimi peccati\" - Vatab.) Jeroboam \"made Israel to sin\" (1 Kings 14:16; 1 Kings 15:26, etc.) It is difficult to conceive, in the face of these and similar words, how any one can seriously maintain that \"the church of Israel was the national church\" (Stanley, 2:264) ]: for the people went to worship before the one even unto Dan. [The people frequented both sanctuaries; why, then, is that at Dan especially mentioned? Some (Rawlinson, e.g.) have suggested that the text is here corrupt, and that we should read, \"before the one to Bethel, and before the other to Dan.\" According to others, \"the one\" (הָאֶחַד) refers to the double הָאֶחַד (\"the one,\" \"the other\"); cf. ver. 29. They would interpret, that is, \"the people went to both, even to the distant Dan\" (Bahr, Thenius). Keil would force the text and understand, \"the people, even unto Dan,\" i.e., the people throughout the whole kingdom. Similarly, Wordsworth. Ewald understands \"before the one\" to mean כְּזֶחַד i.e., \"as one,\" sc. man. On the whole it is better to take the words as they stand, literally. It is quite conceivable that, at first, the people resorted almost exclusively to the Danite sanctuary. Having been for long years a seat of worship, and having probably its \"house of high places,\" or temple (see below), already built, it would naturally be in a position to receive worshippers some time before Bethel was prepared for that purpose. Jeroboam's offering in person at Bethel (ver. 32) which marks the inauguration of his new ritual there, may have been partly designed to attract worshippers to a shrine, which, as being nearer Jerusalem, or for some other reason, was neglected. But the verse is patient of another interpretation. It may intend to convey that the rebellious tribes, in their defiant disregard of the old order of things, the order now represented by a hostile kingdom, went en masse to the opposite point of the compass, even to the unhallowed and hitherto despised sanctuary of the Danites. The LXX. (Vat.) addition here is noticeable, \"And they forsook the house of the Lord.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And he made an house of high places [See on 1 Kings 3:2, and cf. 2 Kings 17:29. It is often assumed (Keil, Rawlinson, al. after Josephus) that Jeroboam built two temples for his cherubim, and the statement of the text, that he built one, is explained on the ground that the historian contrasts the \"house of high places\" with the \"house of the Lord.\" Ewald, too, after 2 Kings 17:29, 32, understands the words as plural. But is it not more probable that a chapel or sanctuary already existed at Dan, where an irregular priesthood had ministered for more than four hundred years? This verse would then refer exclusively to Jeroboam's procedure at Bethel (see next verse). There he built a temple and ordained a number of priests, but Dan had both already. We know that the Danite priests carried on the calf worship to the time of the captivity (Judges 18:30). This \"house of high places\" has grown in Ewald's pages into \"a splendid temple in Canaanite style\"], and made priests of the lowest of the people [Heb. מִקְצות \"from the ends,\" i.e., from all classes, ex universe populo (Gesen.), and not, as the writer explains presently, from the tribe of Levi alone. Genesis 19:4, Judges 18:20, Ezekiel 33:2, prove this to be the correct interpretation of the word. Rawlinson, who remarks that \"Jeroboam could have no motive for specially selecting persons of low condition,\" does not thereby dispose of the A.V. rendering, for the historian might mean that some of Jeroboam's priests were of the lowest stamp, because he could find no others, or because he was so little scrupulous as to take them. \"Leaden priests are well fitted to golden deities\" (Hall)], which were not of the sons of Levi. [Jeroboam would doubtless have been only too glad to have retained the services of the Levitical priests, but they went over in a body to Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 11:13). The statement of ver. 14, that, \"Jeroboam and his sons\" had \"cast them out,\" suggests that they had refused to take part in his new cult and that thereupon he banished them, and, no doubt, confiscated their possessions. The idea of Stanley, that \"following the precedent of the deposition of Abiathar by Solomon, he removed from their places the whole of the sacerdotal order,\" is a wild conjecture for which Scripture affords not the slightest warrant.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah [i.e., the Feast of Tabernacles, which was held on the 15th of the seventh month (cf. 1 Kings 8:2). This was the great feast of the year, and, as the feast of harvest or ingathering, the most joyous. See on 1 Kings 8:1. Had Jeroboam provided no counter attraction to this great festive gathering in Judah he might have found it a formidable temptation to his subjects. The reason usually given for the alteration of the time - in defiance of the law, which expressly fixed it in the seventh month (Leviticus 23:34, 39, 41) - is that the eighth would be more generally convenient in the north, where the harvest or vintage was a month later (Then., Keil), as affording more time for the ingathering. In favour of this view is the consideration that the Jews not unfrequently had to intercalate a month - a second Adar - into their year, because of the season being a late one. Some of the older commentators, e.g., Vatab., think this time was chosen as the anniversary of his secession, but this is pure conjecture, and such an association would be contrary to the genius of the Hebrew people. Keil maintains that Jeroboam's design was to \"make the separation, in a religious point of view, as complete as possible.\" But we can hardly be expected to believe that he altered the month, for the sake of creating a distinction, but \"retained the day of the month, the fifteenth, for the sake of the weak who took offence at his innovations\" (Keil). The day was retained, as Bahr points out, because, the months being lunar, the fifteenth was the day of the full moon], and he offered [Heb. as marg., \"and he went up,\" i.e., ascended the altar; LXX. ἀνέβη. (Keil contends that וַיַּעַל means \"and he sacrificed,\" but this translation is without precedent. Ver. 33, \"and he went up to burn incense is decisive as to the meaning.) the altar was always raised. It was probably approached by s slope, as Exodus 20:26 forbade steps, though it is by no means certain that they were not used even in Solomon's temple, and Jeroboam probably would have no scruples on such a minute point of ritual. It has been thought (Kitto, 4:147) that he was moved to officiate in person by the precedent of the Egyptian kings, who exercised priestly functions; but it is much more probable that he was guided by the example of Solomon at the dedication of the temple] upon [i.e., he stood upon the ledge or platform (called in the A.V. \"compass,\" Exodus 27:5) in the middle of the altar] the altar. So did he in Bethel [i.e., the feast was held at one centre only, and at Bethel alone the king offered in person. But I venture to suggest that instead of כֵּן, \"so did he,\" etc., we should read כִּי. The LXX. seem to have had this word before them - ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον ο{ εποίησεν ἐν βαιθὴλ. And not only does this slight change bring the Hebrew into harmony with the LXX., but it also simplifies the construction. \"He went up upon the altar which he made to sacrifice unto the calves which he made.\" The very tautology is instructive, as suggesting that altar, calves, and priests were all of Jeroboam's making, not of God's ordaining. The use of כּי as a relative ( = אֲשֶׁר) is strictly grammatical], sacrificing [marg., to sacrifice] unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel [Dan being already provided with its priesthood] the priests of the high places [i.e., of \"the house of high places\" (ver. 31). Or it may be a contemptuous designation of Jeroboam's irregular priests] which he had made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings12:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - So he offered [Heb. went up, as before. This verse is really the introduction to the history of the next chapter] upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised [Josephus (Ant. 7:08. 5) seems unaware that this new feast was kept at a different date from the true Feast of Tabernacles. But these words are decisive] of his own heart [The Cethib has מִלְּבֹּד by which Maurer and Keil understand מִלְּבַד (\"seoreum.\" But qu.)

Similarly, Nehemiah 6:8]; and ordered [rather, kept, celebrated] a feast unto [Heb. for] the children of Israel: and he offered [went up] upon the altar, and burnt incense [Heb. to burn, etc. The context seems to imply that it was not incense, or not incense only, but the sacrifice, or sacrificial parts of the victim, that the king burned. See on 1 Kings 13:3 (דֶּשֶׁן). And this meaning is justified by Leviticus 1:9, 17; 1 Samuel 2:16; Amos 4:5, where the same word is used. It cannot be denied, however, that the word is generally used of incense, and it is very probable that both this and sacrifices were offered by Jeroboam on the same altar (cf. 1 Kings 11:8). We may perhaps see in Jeroboam's ministering in person, not only the design to invest the new ordinance with exceptional interest and splendour, but also the idea of encouraging his new priests to enter on their unauthorized functions with. out fear. The history, or even the traditions, of Nadab and Abihu (Leviticus 10.) and of Korah and his company (Numbers 16:40), and the threatenings of the law (Numbers 18:7, 22, cf. 2 Chronicles 26:20), may well have made them hesitate. To allay their fears the king undertakes to offer the first of the sacrifices. And that their fears of a Divine interposition were not groundless the sequel shows.]NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And, behold, there came a man of God [see on 1 Kings 12:22. The \"man of God\" is throughout carefully distinguished from the \"prophet.\" Josephus calls the former Jadon, probably the Grecized form of Iddo, עִדּו, which appears as יֶעְדו Ia'do in the Keri of 2 Chronicles 9:29. Iddo, however, notwithstanding his \"visions against Jeroboam the son of Nebat\" (2 Chronicles 9:29), it cannot have been, for he survived to the reign of Abijah, and indeed wrote a \"story\" (Heb. Midrash, i.e., Commentary) of that reign, whereas this man of God died forthwith. For a similar reason, we cannot believe it to have been Shemaiah, the historian of the reign of Rehoboam (2 Chronicles 12:5, 15)] out of Judah [whither, as a rule, both priests and prophets would seem to have retreated (2 Chronicles 11:14, 16). It is clear, however, that the migration of the latter was not so general as that of the former. In ver. 11 we find a prophet at Bethel; in ch. 14. Ahijah is still at Shiloh, and at a later day we find schools of the prophets at Bethel, Jericho, etc. (2 Kings 2:3, 5). Stanley says with truth that \"the prophetical activity of the time... is to be found in the kingdom, not of Judah, but of Israel,\" but omits to add that it was because the northern kingdom more especially needed their ministry. It was just for this reason that Ahijah and others remained at their posts.] by [Heb. in, same word as in vers. 2, 9, 17, 20, 32, etc. Similarly, 1 Samuel 3:21. The ב is not merely instrumental, but, like the ἐν, of the N.T., denotes the sphere or element. \"By the word\" would imply that he had received a Divine communication; \"in the word,\" that his message possessed him, inspired him, was \"in his heart as a burning fire shut up in his bones\" (Jeremiah 20:9)] the word of the Lord unto Bethel [It is worth remembering that the new sanctuary at Bethel would probably be visible from the temple (Porter, p. 219; Van de Velds, 2:283), so that this function was an act of open defiance]: and Jeroboam stood by [Heb. upon. See on 1 Kings 12:32, 33. It is the same occasion] the altar to burn incense [or to burn the fat, etc., of the sacrifice. See on 1 Kings 12:33. This altar was clearly, pro hac vice, an altar of burnt offering; not an altar of incense, as is proved by the next verse.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the Lord [This apostrophe of the altar is very striking and significant. It is as if the prophet disdained to notice the royal but self-constituted priest; as if it were useless to appeal to him; as if his person was of little consequence compared with the religious system he was inaugurating, the system of which the altar was the centre and embodiment]; Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name [This particular mention of the Reformer by name was formerly regarded, as by many it is still, as a remarkable instance of prophetic foresight. But the tendency of late, even amongst orthodox theologians, has been to doubt the authenticity of these two words, on the ground that it is unlike Scripture prophecy in general to descend to such details, which rather belong to soothsaying than prediction. Prophecy concerns itself not with names, times, and similar particulars, but with the \"progressive development of the kingdom of God in its general features\" (Keil). It is not for a moment denied that the prophet could just as easily, speaking \"in the word of the Lord,\" have mentioned the name of Josiah, as the circumstance that a son of the house of David would utterly destroy the worship of calves. But it is alleged that the latter prediction is quite in accordance with Scripture usage, and the former altogether contrarient thereto. The case of Cyrus (Isaiah 44:28; Isaiah 45:1), it is true, is an exception to the rule, unless כֹרֶשׁ (which means the sun) is, like Pharaoh and Hadad, a name of office, a title of the Persian kings. The instances of Isaac (Genesis 17:19) and Solomon (1 Chronicles 22:9) are not parallels, as in both these cases the name was highly significant, and each was mentioned, not by way of prophecy, but as a direction to bestow that name on a child shortly about to be born. And it is certainly noticeable - though the argument e silentio is necessarily a precarious one - \"that where this narrative is again referred to (2 Kings 23:15-18) there is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah by name\" (Rawlinson). On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the two words יֹאשׁיָּהוּ שְׁמו were no part of the original prophecy, but a marginal note which in course of time found its way accidentally into the text. The idea of Keil, that \"Josiah\" is mentioned here not as a proper name, but as an appellation, \"he whom Jehovah sustains,\" is hardly worthy of serious consideration. It may be allowed, however, that the meaning of the name affords some slender reason for its mention]; and upon thee shall he offer [lit., sacrifice] the priests of the high places [see on 1 Kings 12:32] that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones [Heb. bones of man, i.e., human bones. Nothing could more completely foreshadow the future desecration of the altar. The presence in the congregation of a living man who had merely touched a dead body and had not been purified, defiled the tabernacle (Numbers 19:13), how much more the dead body itself, burnt on the very altar. The Samaritan who once strewed the temple with human ashes (Jos., Ant. 18:02.2) knew that he took the most effectual way to pollute it] shall be burnt [Heb. shall they burn] upon thee. [For the fulfilment, see 2 Kings 23:20, \"At the ground of this judgment, as of the whole theocratic law, lies the jus talionis\" (Keil, 1846).] It is worthy of note how completely this brief protest proclaimed to Jeroboam the utter and shameful overthrow, both of his political and religious systems. A child of the rival house of David should stand where he then stood, his successors extinct or powerless to prevent him, and should cover this new cultus with disgrace and contempt. The man of God, he must have felt, has proclaimed in few words the fall of his dynasty, the triumph of his rival, and the failure of all his schemes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And he gave a sign [The Heb. מופֵת rather signifies a portent (τέρας, miraculum, prodigium) than a sign, the proper word for which is אות. The word occurs repeatedly in the Pentateuch, where it is rendered wonder, or miracle, by our translators (Wordsworth). Signs had, of course, been given before (Exodus 4:30; Exodus 7:9; 1 Samuel 12:17; etc.) but hardly in such immediate attestation of a special message. From this time forward such signs are not infrequent (Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 38:8; 2 Kings 19:29). They mark the decline of faith (Matthew 12:39). As to the need at this crisis for some miraculous token, see Homiletics. The fitness of this particular sign is obvious] the same day, saying, This is the sign which [Rather that; דועק ְ אֲֶשר. The A.V. rendering hardly makes sense. Nor does it agree, as Rawlinson seems to think, with the LXX., which reads τοῦτο τὸ ῤῆμα ο{ ἐλάησε κύριος, etc.] the Lord hath spoken [i.e., by me. \"This is the proof that my message is from Him, and is no idle threat.\" Wordsworth sees in this sign \"a proof vouchsafed by God Himself to the man of Judah, as well as to Jeroboam, that he was really sent by God,\" etc. But surely a man who came \"in the word of the Lord,\" and cried, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" wanted no proof that \"he was doing God's bidding\" (see 1 Corinthians 14:22)]; Behold, the altar shall be rent and the ashes [strictly, fat ashes. דֶּשֶׁן; properly, \"fatness\" (see Judges 9:9; Psalm 63:5. πιότης, LXX.), is the fat of the sacrifice, which was burnt upon the altar, mixed with the ashes that consumed it] that are upon it shall be poured out. [The sign, a partial destruction of the altar, and the scattering of the sacrifice, was admirably calculated to presage its ultimate and final and ignominious overthrow. The idea favoured by Stanley (\"Jewish Ch.\" 2:280) that this prediction was fulfilled \"if not before, at least\" in the time of Amos, when the altar was destroyed by an earthquake shock (Amos 9:1; cf. 3:14), does not seem to take account of ver. 5.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.

The Heb. omits \"Jeroboam\"] heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand [instinctively. His first thought was, not to wait and see whether the promised sign was given, but to seize and punish the man who had dared thus to denounce and thwart him. And we may imagine how extremely mortifying this interruption must have been to him. It threatened the complete frustration of his policy at the very moment when it seemed certain of suceess] from the altar [the ledge or platform, i.e., where he stood. He did not leave it, but shouted his commands to his servants], saying, Lay hold on him. [\"Arrest him,\" \"let him not escape.\" One word in the Heb.] And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up [Possibly the result of paralysis or tetanus (Ackermann in Bahr). It was like the \"withered hand\" of the New Testament (Matthew 12:10, etc.) deprived of feeling and vital force, as the next words show], so that he could not pull it in again to him. [It was not only powerless to punish, it was punished. \"Now stands the king of Israel, like some antique statue, in a posture of impotent endeavour\" (Hall). This was a warning to the king, not so much against his unauthorized and schismatical rites, as against his attempt to avenge himself on the messenger of God (Psalm 105:14, 15).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The altar also was rent [by the same invisible power, and probably at the same moment], and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.

See especially Exodus 32:11; 2 Kings 13:4; 2 Chronicles 33:12; Proverbs 19:6] of the Lord thy God [i.e., whose messenger thou art. \"Jeroboam, conscience stricken, does not dare to call Jehovah his own God\" (Wordsworth). This was probably the case, yet surely it is an inference not warranted by the text. The expression, \"The Lord thy God,\" is of constant occurrence, especially when a \"man of God\" is addressed; cf. 1 Kings 17:12; 1 Kings 18:10], and pray for me [This sudden change in his bearing shows how much Jeroboam was frightened. The sight, too, of the king humbly supplicating the prophet who a moment before had protested against the calf worship was calculated to make an impression on the minds of the people], that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought [lit., stroked the face of] the Lord, and the king's hand was restored him, and became as it was before.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself [with food, ablutions, etc. (Genesis 18:4, 5; Genesis 19:2; Mark 7:3, etc.) We are hardly justified in seeing in these words (with Bahr and Keil) an attempt to \"gain the prophet over to his side by friendliness,\" and to render his threat harmless in the eyes of the people. The king doubtless may have hoped that it would \"blunt the edge of the prophet's denunciation of his schismatical altar\" (Wordsworth); but this was not the object, or not the sole object, with which the invitation was given. Jeroboam could not possibly have done less, after the signal service the man of God had rendered him, than invite him to his palace. Eastern courtesy alone (Genesis 18:4; Genesis 19:2; Genesis 43:24, etc.) would require him to offer hospitality to his benefactor. And he could scarcely hope that any hospitalities would either neutralize the impression which the recent miracles had made, or win over to his side one who had a direct commission from the Most High to oppose him. With more reason, Wordsworth cites 1 Samuel 15:30, \"Honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people.\" A feeling of gratitude may have prompted the invitation, while the king at the same time was very sensible of the advantages which would accrue to himself if it were accepted], and I will give thee a reward. [The services, especially of seers and prophets, were invariably requited in the East with presents, as are those of Judges, Kadis, Kaimakams, and other officers at the present day (see 1 Kings 14:3; Genesis 24:53; Genesis 33:11; Genesis 43:11; Numbers 22:17; Judges 3:17; Judges 6:18; Judges 13:15; 1 Samuel 9:7, 8; 1 Samuel 12:3; 2 Kings 5:5, 15; 2 Kings 8:8, 9).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house [cf. Numbers 22:18, of which, however, there is hardly a reminiscence. Obviously, half the contents or wealth of thy house], I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For so was it charged [Heb. he, sc. the Lord, charged me] me by [Heb. in] the word of the Lord, saying, Fat no bread, nor drinkwater [Participation in food - the \"eating salt\" - is in the East a token of friendship and affinity; a sign of close communion and fellowship. The prophet's refusal to participate was consequently a practical and forcible disclaimer of all fellowship, a virtual excommunication, a public repudiation of the calf worshippers. Cf. 1 Corinthians 5:11, \"With such an one, no, not to eat.\" As Corn. a Lapide,\" Ut ipso facto ostenderet, Bethelitas idololatras adeo esse detestabiles, et a Deo quasi excommunicates, ut nullum fidelium cum iis cibi vel potus communionem habere velit\"], nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. [ the object of this command was not \"simply to test the obedience of the prophet\" (Rawlinson), nor yet that no one might \"force him to a delay which was irreconcilable with his commission\" (Keil), for that was practically executed, but to avoid as far as possible - what, indeed, happened in spite of these precautions - his being traced and followed. Because of this provision, the old prophet (ver. 10) was reduced to ask, \"What way went he?\" But the charge, we can hardly doubt,was also designed to serve another purpose, viz., to warn the prophet against doing what he did presently - against returning to Bethel. When he was followed, and when he was told of a revelation commanding his return, he should have remembered, among other things, that it had clearly been part of God's purpose, as evidenced by the explicit instructions given him, that he should not be followed. This alone should have led him to suspect this old prophet of deceit.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 13:11-34. THE DISOBEDIENCE AND DEATH OF THE MAN OF GOD. - The seduction of the man of God, who has borne such fearless witness against Jeroboam's ecclesiastical policy, and his tragical end, are now narrated, partly because of the deep impression the story made at the time, but principally because these events were in themselves an eloquent testimony against the worship of the calves and the whole ecclesiastical policy of Jeroboam, and a solemn warning for all time against any, the slightest, departure from the commandments of God. The very unfaithfulness of this accredited messenger of the Most High, and the instant punishment it provoked, became part of the Divine protest against the new regime, against the unfaithfulness of Israel; whilst the remarkable manner in which these occurrences were recalled to the nation's memory in the reign of Josiah (2 Kings 23:17, 18) made it impossible for the historian of the theocracy to pass them over without notice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now there dwelt an old prophet [Heb. a certain (lit. one) old prophet. For this use of אֶחָד ( = τις) cf. 1 Kings 20:13; 1 Kings 19:4] at Bethel [It is at first somewhat surprising to find one of the prophetic order residing here, at the very seat and stronghold of the apostasy, especially after what we read in 2 Chronicles 11:13-16, that the priests and Levites, and it would seem all devout worshippers of the Lord God of Israel, had left the country, and had gone over to Rehoboam. For we cannot suppose that a sense of duty had kept this prophet at his post (see note on ver. 1). The fact that he remained, not only in the kingdom, but at its ecclesiastical capital; that he stood by without protest when the schism was being effected, and that, though not present himself at the sacrifice, he permitted his sons to be there, is a sufficient index to his character. It is quite possible that strong political sympathies had warped his judgment, and that he had persuaded himself that the policy of Jeroboam was necessitated by the division of the kingdom, which he knew to be from the Lord, and which one of his own order had foretold. Or it may be that, despite his better judgment, he had gone with his tribe and the majority of the nation, and now felt it difficult to withdraw from a false position. Or, finally, he may have taken the side of Jeroboam because of the greater honours and rewards that prince had to bestow (see on ver. 18). There is a striking similarity between his position and action and that of Balaam]; and his sons [The Heb. has son; The LXX., Syr., and Vulg., sons. It is quite true that a \"very slight change in the Hebrew text would bring it into accordance with the Septuagint here\" (Rawlinson, similarly Ewald), but it would be against sound principles of textual criticism to make it. It is much more likely that the LXX. and other versions have been altered already, and that the plural has been introduced here because it is uniformly found in the later narrative. \"His son\" (בִּנו), as the lectio ardua, is therefore to he retained. The use of the singular indicates that one of them was at first the principal speaker. Perhaps one hastened home with the news before the rest. The sons of the prophet are not to be confounded with \"the sons (i.e., disciples) of the prophets\" (2 Kings 2:3, 4, passim); not merely because \"the latter would scarcely have witnessed the golden calf worship\" (Bahr), but also because they would have been differently designated] came and told him all the works [Heb. work] that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they [observe the plural] told also to their father. [It is quite clear that the virtual excommunication which the man of God had pronounced had made as great an impression as the signs which he had showed. The interdict was a matter which came home to the Bethelites, as an affront to the whole community.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And their father said unto them, What way went he? [The question shows that the old prophet throughly understood the import of those \"words,\" and that his first thought was that the interdict must be removed at any cost.] For his sons had seen [Heb. and his sons saw, or showed. LXX. δεικνύουσιν. Similarly most of the versions. A very slight change in the vowel points ויּרַאְוּ for ויּרִאוַּ would give this sense] what way the man of God went which came from Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass.

These are the words of one who had made up his mind, coute que coute, to bring the man of God back.] So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak [Heb. the oak; i.e., the well-known oak. Possibly there was but one, or one of great size, in the neighbourhood - such trees are comparatively rare in Palestine. Possibly also this tree became well known from these events. It is singular that in another place (Genesis 35:8) we read of \"the oak\" (אַלּון) of Bethel, whilst in Judges 4:5 we read of the \"palm tree\" (תֹּמֶר) of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel.\" And it is not at all improbable, seeing that in 1 Samuel 10:3 we read of the terebinth (אֵלון) of Tabor - in the A.V. rendered \"plain of Tabor\" - which Ewald (\"Hist. Israel,\" 3:21; 4:31) considers to be only a dialectic variation of Deborah, and remembering the great age to which these trees attain, that the same tree is referred to throughout. The word here used, it is true, is אֵלָה (which is generally supposed to indicate the terebinth, but is also \"used of any large tree\" (Gesenius), and which, therefore, may be used of the אַלּון of Bethel. Both names are derived from the same root (אוּל fortis. Cf. Amos 2:9), and both indicate varieties - what varieties it is not quite clear - of the oak. Some expositors have seen in this brief rest the beginning of his sin, and certainly it would seem against the spirit of his instructions to remain so near a place (see note on ver. 16) from which he was to vanish speedily, and, if possible, unperceived. In any case the action betrays his fatigue and exhaustion], and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?

[The translation \"in that place\" adopted by Wordsworth (after the Vulgate, in loco isto) does not agree with the Hebrew. And it is not required by the context. The tree was probably at no great distance from the town.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - For it was said to me [Heb. a word to me] by [Heb. in] the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He said unto him; I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel (Bahr observes that \"he does not venture to say that Jehovah spake to him, but says an angel did.\" Is it not more probable that the angel was mentioned, partly for the purpose of giving an air of circumstantiality and reality to his story, and partly to convey the idea of his having a superior authority for his message? A communication through a celestial messenger would seem to have been regarded as a higher form of revelation than a subjective communication to the mind of the prophet. Cf. Acts 7:53; Hebrews 2:2; Luke 1:13, 29; Acts 27:23, etc. Observe, the prophet speaks presently of \"the word of Jehovah\"] spake unto me by [Heb. in; same expression as in ver. 17] the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat [Heb. and he shall eat] bread and drink water. But he lied to him. [These last words are inserted parenthetically; hence there is no \"but\" in the Heb. The true character and designs and motives of this \"old prophet\" have long been a crux interpretum (see Hall, Contempl., 2:151-3.) Some, including Josephus and most Jewish commentators, have supposed him to be altogether a false and lying prophet, such as are found plentifully later on in the history (1 Kings 22:6; Jeremiah 28:1); but against this is the fact that he was undoubtedly the channel of a Divine communication (ver. 21). The real difficulty, no doubt, lies in the fact that one by whom the Spirit of God spake to man should have acted so base a part as he did. But it must be rememberedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that he did not know what a terrible judgment his lie would bring upon \"the man of God;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that truth had not the place in the Jewish scheme which it has in Christian morals;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that the gift of prophecy is compatible with much moral imperfection on the part of the prophet - the cases of Balaam and Caiaphas will occur to all - andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) that this man was constrained to prophesy almost in spite of himself; he was compelled, i.e., to proclaim his own falseness, and to announce the punishment of the man he had himself deceived. It is also to be considered that this lying prophet, like those of 1 Kings 22:22, accomplished the purpose of God, which was to make the man of God a sign to the men of that generation. Cf. Isaiah 20:3; Ezekiel 12:6; Ezekiel 24:24. In this latter consideration, indeed, lies the key to the history, The object the old prophet had in view it is not so difficult to divine. He hears that the prophet of Judah has refused the hospitality of King Jeroboam, and has put the city of Bethel and the new cultus under a virtual ban by refusing to eat bread in the place, or to hold any communication with the inhabitants, himself among the rest, although he has taken no part, even by his presence, in the ceremonial of the day. He naturally feels himself condemned and aggrieved by this conduct. A prophet would feel the interdict much more keenly than the people, and there can be little doubt that this man, who had been trying to serve two masters, was deeply mortified by the excommunication pronounced against him. He resolves, therefore, to rehabilitate himself in his own estimation and that of his neighbours, by bringing back the man of God to eat and to drink, and so in effect to remove the interdict, at any cost. If he succeeds, he win make the whole city, and especially the sovereign, whose policy has been so emphatically condemned, his debtor; while by accomplishing what the king had failed to effect, he will at once heal his wounded pride and secure a position of influence in the new kingdom. If it was the hope of temporal advancement had detained him at Bethel, he now sees, as he thinks, an easy way to its attainment; if it was an ardent sympathy with the new state of things, he sees before him an opportunity of expressing it in a most practical and serviceable way.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water [cf. ver. 10].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And it came to pass, as they sat at the table [cf.

[The desire, common in a greater or less degree to all mankind, to rest after death amongst kindred dust, was especially strong in the Jew. It is evidenced by the common euphemism \"he was gathered unto his fathers,\" and by the provisions of Abraham (Genesis 23:4), Jacob (Genesis 47:29; Genesis 49:29-31), and Joseph (Genesis 50:25). See also the words of Barzillai (2 Samuel 19:37; and compare 2 Samuel 2:32). This denunciation did not necessarily imply a violent death (as Keil, al.) or even a speedy death, but it prepared the man of God for some untimely end.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled [i.e., the prophet of Bethel; the \"man of God\" would seem to have come on foot. See below] for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back. This translation is inadmissible. For not only is the term \"prophet\" throughout this narrative restricted to the prophet of Bethel (the prophet of Judah being always spoken of as \"the man of God,\") but the expression here used הַנָּבִיא א ה is also twice used (vers. 20, 26) of the same prophet. He is characterized there, that is to say, as \"the prophet which brought him back;\" it is hardly likely, therefore, that the same words are here to be interpreted, \"the prophet whom he brought back.\" The mistake has arisen from the proximity of לו (\"for him\") to לַנָּבִיּא (\"to\" or \"for the prophet\"). But the לוis here indicative of possession (the dative of the possessor), as in 1 Samuel 14:16, \"the watchmen to,\" i.e., of, \"Saul,\" and 1 Samuel 16:18, \"a son to Jesse\" (cf. Genesis 14:18 Heb.; 1 Kings 5:29 [1 Kings 5:15] Heb.; Ruth 2:3 Heb.) We must therefore render \"He (the old prophet, but this is not absolutely certain; the \"man of God\" may be understood) saddled for him (the man of God) the ass of the prophet which brought him back.\" The man of God had been delayed by his return to Bethel, and the prophet, out of pity, lends or gives him his ass. Not merely, it is probable, for the sake of speeding him on his way, but that he might have some living thing with him on a journey which he had so much cause to dread.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And when he was gone [Heb. and he went], a lion (Lions were evidently numerous in Palestine in former days, though they are now extinct. This is proved by the names of places, such as Laish, Lebaoth, etc., and by the constant reference to them in Scripture. They had their lairs in the forests, one of which existed near Bethel (2 Kings 2:24), and especially in the thickets of the Jordan valley (Jeremiah 49:19; Zechariah 11:3).] met [Heb. found. The primary meaning of מָצָא is, no doubt, \"found accidentally,\" \"came upon\" (εῦρεν, invenit), but it is often used of finding after a search (1 Samuel 9:4, etc.), and it should be remembered that this is the word used in vers. 14, 28] him by [in, as below] the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way [road, highway, ver. 25], and the ass stood [Heb. standing] by it, the lion also stood [standing] by the carcase. [These particulars are mentioned to show that his death was no accident, or chance, but a visitation of God. There are probably but few persons who have not felt that this summary punishment was marked by extreme severity; the more so, as the prophet was cruelly deceived, and that by a brother prophet, who claimed to have received a subsequent revelation, and whom, consequently, it appeared to be a duty to obey. And when it is observed that the really guilty person, the prophet of Bethel, so far as appears, escaped all punishment, and by his lie secured for himself respect for his remains, we seem to have a case of positive hardship and injustice. As I have discussed the question at some length elsewhere (Homil. Quart., vol. 4. pp. 214-221), it must suffice to say here that the difficulty is at once removed if we remember that although the Jewish dispensation was one of temporal recompenses, yet all the same there is a judgment hereafter. No doubt the man of God was punished for his disobedience, for inexcusable disobedience it was. It is quite true that he was solemnly assured that an angel had appeared to revoke his commission, but for this he had only the word of a stranger, of one, too, with whom he had been commanded \"not even to eat.\" He had \"the word of the Lord;\" that is to say, the voice of God, borne in upon his soul, forbidding his return, and the word of an irreligious stranger, who gave no \"sign the same day\" in proof of his mission, authorizing it. There can be no doubt which he ought to have followed, the more so as the command he had himself received was so remarkably explicit and decisive (ver. 9); so decisive that we can hardly suppose he would have deviated from it, had not the pains of hunger and thirst pleaded powerfully in favour of the pretended revelation of the Bethelite prophet. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that he eagerly welcomed this cause for returning. It is impossible, therefore, to acquit him of disobedience. Nor is it difficult to see that the consequences of this disobedience were serious. It was not as if he had disregarded a mere positive obligation, the only object of which was to test his obedience (Rawlinson); he had acted in a way calculated to destroy the moral effect of his mission. He had been employed not only to testify publicly against the calf worship, but also to lay the city and the new sanctuary of Jeroboam under an interdict, and by his return that interdict lost much of its force. His eating and drinking, small matters in themselves, were full of significance. Indeed, he did in one way precisely what Jeroboam and his people were doing in another he forsook the plain commands of God for the ordinances of men; he listened to the tempter and ate the forbidden fruit; and so it came to pass flint, instead of witnessing against disobedience, he himself set them the example of disobedience. It is the story of the Fall over again; and therefore death, the punishment of the Fall, befell him. But before we say that his punishment was too severe, let us remember what, by the mercy of God, that primal punishment has become. It has been turned into a blessing. It has given us the incarnation, redemption, eternal life. We forget that death is not necessarily an evil - is in reality a blessing. One of the heathen has said that if we only knew what the future life was like, we should not be content to live. To this \"man of God\" it must surely have been gain to die. If the flesh was destroyed, it was that the spirit might be saved (1 Corinthians 5:5). Only because we forget that death is the gate of life do we complain of the severity of his doom. And as to the lying prophet who wrought all this mischief escaping retribution - which, by the way, he did not do, for assuredly he must have had a life-long remorse - it is overlooked that the day of retribution has not yet arrived. There is for him a judgment to come. It may he said that the Jew did not know of this - that the future life had not then been revealed. That is quite true, and for that very reason this visitation would make all the deeper impression on their minds. To this must be added that the man of God did not die merely or principally because of his sin, but \"that the works of God might be made manifest in him.\" His death was necessary in order that his mission might not be altogether invalidated. His miserable end - as it must have seemed to them - would surely speak to the inhabitants of Bethel and to all Israel and Judah, for long years to come, as to the sure vengeance awaiting the disobedient, whether king, prophet, priest, or people. Though dead \"he cried against the altar of Bethel.\" And the sacred narrative (vers. 26-32) affords us some ground for hoping that the \"old prophet\" became penitent for his sin. It is noteworthy that he joins his testimony to that of the man of God. Thus, this tragedy extorted even from him a warning against disobedience (ver. 26), and a confirmation of the prophecy against the altar of Bethel (ver. 32).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. [This was precisely what God had designed. By this means, the very disobedience and death of the man of God became a part of the protest against the new rites. \"For if the partaking of food against the commandment of God, though the result not of indulgence, but of deceit, brought so great a punishment upon a righteous man, what sort of chastisements would befall those who had left God their Maker and were worshipping senseless images\" (Theodoret.)]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient [Heb. rebelled; same word as in ver. 21] unto the word [Heb. \"mouth,\" as in ver. 21] of the Lord: therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn [Heb. as marg., broken.

[The mourning is specially mentioned, because in the East professional wailers were and are employed at funerals. The Jew, no less than the Greek and Roman, esteemed it a great misfortune and disgrace to be deprived of decent burial: Isaiah 14:19; Jeremiah 22:19; and especially 2 Kings 9:10.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And he laid his carcase in his own grave [Matthew 27:60.

It hardly implies that \"he was mourned and buried as a relative of the family\" (Bahr). Seeing that the old prophet was responsible for his death, he could hardly have done less. \"It is a cruel courtesy to kill a man and then help him to his grave\" (Hall).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings13:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre [Palestine, being of limestone formation, has a large number of caves. These, enlarged and adapted, were everywhere used for interments. (\"The whole cliffs on its southern side [Hinnom] are honeycombed with tombs,\" Porter). In three sides of the cave vaults (loculi), each large enough to hold a body, were recessed in the rock, the entrance being closed by a slab of stone (see Conder, pp. 85, 96, 118, etc.) In the so called \"tombs of the kings\" and \"prophets\" we have such sepulchres on a large scale. A Paper on the Tombs of Palestine will be found in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, p. 66 sqq.

The bodies may have been in much closer contact. See 2 Kings 13:21. The LXX. adds here, \"That my bones may be saved with his bones;\" an obvious gloss, founded on 2 Kings 23:18. This request throws some light on the yearning desire of the modern Jew to rest as near as possible to the bodies of the saints.

Rawlinson gathers, \"from the mention of the great high place in 1 Kings 3:4, that there were many lesser high places in the land,\" which, no doubt, was the case at the date of Solomon's accession. It is probable, however, that many of these, if not all, would be deserted when the temple was built. And it is most reasonable to suppose that in these, as in the following words, the historian has represented the prediction or affirmation of the old prophet in the language of his own time] which are in the cities of Samaria. [Obviously, these exact words cannot have been used by the prophet of Bethel, for Samaria dates its existence and name from the reign of Omri (1 Kings 16:24).

According to Josephus, the old prophet now explained away the miracles of the prophet of Judah, alleging that the altar had fallen because it was new and the king's hand had become powerless from fatigue (Ant., 8:09, § 1)], but made again [Heb. \"returned and made.\" The tautology is significant. He returned not from his sin, but returned to it] of the lowest [see on 1 Kings 12:11] of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would [Heb. pleased], he consecrated [Heb. filled his hand. In the consecration of Aaron and his sons, and possibly of their successors also, the portions of the victim which were usually burned upon the altar, together with the right shoulder or leg, which was the priest's portion, and three cakes of unleavened Bread, were put into the hands of the candidates for the priesthood, and waved before the Lord before they were offered on the altar (Exodus 29:22-26; Leviticus 8:25-28). To \"fill the hand\" consequently Became a synonym for consecration] him [It would almost appear, from the extreme readiness with which Jeroboam ordained his priests, that few candidates offered themselves for the office. In one respect, however, he exacted more from the candidate than did the law. For whereas the latter required \"one bullock and two rams\" (Exodus 29:1, etc.), he demanded one Bullock and seven rams as the offering on consecration (2 Chronicles 13:9], and he became one of the priests [Heb. and he became priests, etc. So the Chaldee.

And we are taught here that both events are to be regarded, under the dispensation of temporal rewards and punishments, as the recompenses of his impiety; of that daring schismatic policy which, in all its branches, betrayed a complete disregard of the terms of the covenant, and which was persevered in contemptuous defiance of the repeated warnings of God.]NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - At that time [or about (כְּ) that time. The king is now settled at Tirzah (ver. 17). In 1 Kings 12:25 we left him residing at Shechem. The time referred to is that somewhat indefinite period mentioned in 1 Kings 13:33, 34. These opening words clearly connect the sickness with Jeroboam's impenitence. What led the king to move his Court to Tirzah, Shechem being, as we have already seen, not only the capital of Ephraim, but \"the natural capital of Palestine,\" \"its central situation, its accessibility, and its wonderfully fine water supply\" giving it \"advantages not enjoyed by any other city in the land\" (Conder), we are not told; but it is interesting and instructive to find that it has one conspicuous disadvantage as a capital, viz., that it is \"commanded by a hill on either side so close to the town, that the old geographer, Marino Sanuto, in the fourteenth century, considers the place to be untenable by any military force, because stones might be rolled clown upon the houses, from either Ebal or Gerizim\" (Conder, p. 16.

Israel,\" 4:23)] Abijah [Rawlinson sees in the name, which means \"Jehovah is his father,\" an indication that Jeroboam \"did not intend to desert the worship of Jehovah.\" But the name was probably bestowed long before the schism possibly in Egypt. It is more likely that it connects itself, if with anything, with the message of Jehovah to him (1 Kings 11:28). But the name was not uncommon - it was borne by a son of Rehoboam (ver. 31; compare Ahijah, below), and inferences from names must necessarily be precarious] the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

For its history, see Joshua 16:5; Joshua 18:1-10; Judges 18:31; Judges 21:19; 1 Samuel 4:3; Jeremiah 41:5. Presuming that Tirzah is to be identified with Teiasir (see on ver. 17) Shiloh would be over thirty miles' distant - more than a day's journey to the queen, as the road involves some toilsome climbing]: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet [see on 1 Kings 11:29. Shiloh was probably the birthplace, as well as the residence, of Ahijah. It was in the territory of Ephraim (Joshua 16:6), and at no great distance from Bethel. We can only explain Ahijah's continued residence there, after the migration of the God-fearing Israelites to the southern kingdom, not by his great age, but by the supposition that, having been concerned in the transfer of the kingdom to Jeroboam, he felt it a duty to stay and watch his career. And the time has now come when he can be useful. His relations with Jeroboam had apparently so far been good.

Both Saul and Solomon had sinned (1 Samuel passim; 1 Kings 11:5, 6), though neither had set up an organized idolism and \"made Israel to sin\"]: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods [in defiance of the decalogue (Exodus 20:4). Jeroboam, no doubt, insisted that his calves were not idols, but cherubic symbols. But God does not recognize this distinction. Practically they were \"other gods,\" and so they are here called derisively], and molten images [the word is used of the golden calf, Exodus 32:4, 8.

These severe retributions are calculated and proportioned precisely as if there were no hereafter] of Jeroboam, and win cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall [This phrase, which Rawlinson observes is confined to the period from David to Jehu, is by him, and generally, understood to mean \"every male.\" (It is found in 1 Samuel 25:22; 1 Kings 16:11; 1 Kings 21:21; and 2 Kings 9:8.) But it is noteworthy, as Gesenius has remarked, that this is not a habit of Eastern men. Every traveller in Egypt will confirm the remark of Herodotus (ch. 2:35) on this subject, and the same applies to Palestine; i.e., the men sit down for this purpose, covered with their garments (Judges 3:24; 1 Samuel 24:3). Some, consequently, have been led to suppose that the reference is to the dog, but animals would hardly share in the destruction of the royal house. Gesenius is probably right when he interprets it of boys. Thus understood, it lends additional meaning to the passages where it occurs. It expresses extermination, root and branch, man and boy], and him that is shut up and left in Israel [A proverbial expression (Deuteronomy 32:36; 1 Kings 21:21; 2 Kings 9:8), and involving some play upon words.

The first rendering is the more literal. The \"after\" is explained, not as Bahr (\"as often as a new scion arises I will take it away\"), but by the fact that one who expels another follows after him (Gesen.)] of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung [cf. 2 Kings 9:37; Job 20:7; Jeremiah 8:2; Jeremiah 9:22; Jeremiah 16:4.

Cf. Psalm 79:2; Jeremiah 7:33; Jeremiah 16:4; Jeremiah 34:20; Ezekiel 29:5, etc. For him it had a factitious horror, because of the threatening of Deuteronomy 28:26; cf. Revelation 19:17, 18. It was, therefore, the climax of disgrace and misfortune; the greatest dishonour that could be offered to the dust and to the memory. Hence the threat of David (1 Samuel 17:46; cf. ver. 44); hence the devotion of Rizpah (2 Samuel 21:10), and the complaint of the Psalmist (Psalm 79:2). Cf.

[Rawlinson only expresses a general feeling when he says that \"no satisfactory sense can be obtained from the Hebrew text,\" and suggests that it is corrupt or defective. The passage, no doubt, is one of extreme difficulty, and inasmuch as the MSS. and Versions lend us no aid to its interpretation, affords scope for conjecture. The explanation I venture to submit may, I hope, contribute - it can hardly do more - to the elucidation of the text. I observe that in ver. 13 זֶה is used of Abijah, \"this one alone,\" etc. I assume that it has the same import here, viz., \"this one today,\" i.e., \"this one dies or is cut off today,\" הַיּום being understood as constantly, adverbially, - hodie (see, e.g., Genesis 4:14; Genesis 22:14; 1 Kings 2:24). It would be a natural reflection to the prophet who had just been speaking of the excision of the house of Jeroboam, \"one perishes today, judgment is already begun,\" i.e. As to the rest, for עָתָּה I would read אָתָּה, which has practically the same sound, and for which, consequently, עַתָּה is sometimes substituted by the transcriber, as in 1 Kings 1:18, 20, and understand \"And what wilt thou also do?\" i.e., what will become of thee also? It is quite possible (ver. 11) that Jeroboam's wife perished in the wholesale destruction of his house, as it is clear from the severe punishment assigned to her (ver. 12) that she must have shared in his sin. The readiness with which she lent herself to this deceit (ver. 4) also favours the supposition that she had approved his policy. She would then have survived her husband only two years. Keil's explanation, \"cut off the house of Jeroboam this day,\" appears contrary to actual fact, while to interpret \"that day\" (with the A.V.) is contrary to Hebrew grammar.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For [Heb.

This is the first clear prophecy of the captivity foreshadowed by Moses (Deuteronomy 4:27; Deuteronomy 28:25, 36, 63, 64), and by Solomon (1 Kings 8:46-50). For its fulfilment, see 2 Kings 17:6; 2 Kings 18:11, etc.], because they have made their groves [Heb. their Asherahs, i.e., images of Astarte. The translation \"grove\" after the LXX. ἄλσος, Vulg. lucus, is now abandoned. It is clear some sort of idol is intended by the term. This is evident from ver. 23, where it is said the Asherahs (A.V. groves) were built \"under every green tree\" (cf. 2 Kings 17:10); from 1 Kings 15:13 (where see note); from 2 Kings 23:6, which tells how Josiah \"brought out the Asherahs out of the house of the Lord,\" and from the connexion in which the word is found with \"molten images, carved images,\" etc. (ver. 23; 2 Chronicles 33:19; 2 Chronicles 34:3, 4; cf. also Judges 3:7; 1 Kings 18:19). They were doubtless effigies of Ashtoreth, made of wood (Deuteronomy 7:5; cf. 2 Kings 23:6), planted erect in the ground (Deuteronomy 16:21), and were consecrated to her impure and revolting worship. It is clear from this passage that the frightful impurities of the Canaanitish races had subsisted in the new kingdom by the side of the new sacra. They had probably revived under Jeroboam's rule, having apparently been in abeyance since the time of Gideon], provoking the Lord to anger.

See Joshua 12:24. Both these writers admit, however, that if this is indeed Tirzah, \"all traces of royalty have disappeared.\" \"With the exception of a few sepulchral caves, subterranean granaries, wells, and old hewn stones, nothing of ancient Tirzah remains in Taluse.\" Condor recognizes the name in the modern Teiasir - a village near Jezreel, in the Great Plain which \"contains the exact letters of the Hebrew word, though the two last radicals are interchanged in position.\" \"The beauty of the position... the ancient remains, and the old main road from the place to Shechem seem to agree well with the idea of its having once been a capital\" (\"Tentwork,\" p. 57). Some of its \"numerous rock-cut sepulchres,\" he thinks, may be the tombs of the early kings of Israel. It was famed for its beauty (Song of Solomon 6:4), and for this reason, perhaps, among others (see on ver. 1) was selected by Jeroboam for his residence. It is not certain that it had taken the place of Shechem as the political capital]: and when she came [the Hebrew is much more graphic. \"She came to... and the child died\"] to the threshold of the door [Heb. house], the child died.

After his defeat by Abijah, we are told, \"the Lord struck him, and he died,\" which may either mean that he died by a lingering disease (2 Chronicles 21:18, 19) or more suddenly (2 Samuel 12:15), but which certainly implies that he died \"by the visitation of God.\" I have suggested elsewhere (Homil. Quart. IV., p. 257) that the \"stroke\" was not improbably his son's death, which was at once so tragical and such a bitter foretaste of judgment to come. He may have \"warred and reigned\" (ver. 19) after this event. He may also have steadily drooped to his grave], and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 14:21-31.

Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty [or twenty. See on 1 Kings 12:1] and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned [this reign is related at greater length in 2 Chronicles 11, 12.] seventeen years [cf. 1 Kings 15:1] in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose [cf. 1 Kings 11:36; Psalm 78:68; Nehemiah 1:9] out of all the tribes of Israel [cf. 2 Chronicles 6:6; 2 Kings 21:7] to put his name there. The historian reminds us that Jerusalem was by God's appointment the religious centre of the land; that Bethel and Dan were no sanctuaries of His choosing; and that, however much the realm of Rehoboam was restricted, he still reigned in the capital of God's choice. It is possible the words have some reference to the next verse, and imply that, though it was the holy city, yet even there they fell away from God (Bahr). And his mother's name was Naamah [or, according to the LXX., Naanan. See on 1 Kings 12:24], an [Heb. the, i.e., the well-known] Ammonitess. [The name of the mother is given with every king of Judah, principally because of the position of influence she occupied in the kingdom. See on 1 Kings 2:13, and ver. 31 below.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord [not, however, before the fourth year of Rehoboam's reign. For the first three Fears the nation remained steadfast in the faith, and the kingdom was greatly strengthened and consolidated. The defection commenced when Rehoboam began to feel himself secure (2 Chronicles 12:1). It is to be observed, however, that the historian says \"Judah\" (not Rehoboam) \"did evil,\" etc. It is probable that a considerable section of the people approved of the idolatrous practices introduced in the preceding reign, and that Rehoboam was unable to repress them. It was his misfortune to have to reap the bitter fruits of Solomon's unfaithfulness], and they provoked him to jealousy [Heb. made him jealous. Same word, Exodus 20:5; Exodus 34:14; Numbers 5:14. The words of the covenant proclaimed the Lord a,' jealous God.\" This is of course anthropomorphic language. The nation was regarded as the bride of Jehovah, and God is said to be made jealous, because idolatry was unfaithfulness to Him. The worship of Baal and Ashtoreth, it must be remembered, involved unutterable immoralities, hence the special fitness of the word, which is only used of idolatry of one kind or other] with their sins which they had committed [Heb. sinned] above all that their fathers had done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - For they also [i.e., they as well as the ten tribes] built them high places [i.e., houses of high places. See on 1 Kings 3:2 and 1 Kings 13:32] and images [Heb. pillars or statues (מַצֵּבות; LXX., στήλας). These were, no doubt, originally memorial pillars or stones, erected to commemorate some Divine manifestation, and with no thought of idolatry (see Genesis 31:13; Genesis 35:14, 20; Genesis 28:18). But the Canaanites erected pillars, which were also statues or images, to their god, Baal. Hence we read of the \"image\" (מַצֵּבָה) of Baal (2 Kings 3:2; 2 Kings 10:26, 27; cf. 18:4; 23. 14); and hence also we find such images frequently mentioned side by side with the so-called \"groves,\" i.e., the \"Asherahs\" (ver. 15; Exodus 34:13; Deuteronomy 7:5; Deuteronomy 12:3; Deuteronomy 16:21, etc.) Both the Mazzebah and the Asherah, consequently, was an upright pillar or post, but the former was of stone, the latter of wood; the former dedicated to Baal, the god of nature, of generation; the latter to Ashtoreth, the goddess of nature and productive power. The gradual transition of the memorial pillar into the Baal statue is hinted at in Leviticus 26:1. It is observable that these idolatrous and immoral rites seem to have found a home in Judah before they were introduced into Israel] and groves [Asherahs, idols; see on ver. 15. This verse proves conclusively that the translation \"grove\" is a mistaken one] on every high hill, and under every green tree. [The phrase is from the Pentateuch, Deuteronomy 12:2; cf. Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:6; Hosea 4:13. \"Probably the evil example of Maachah, his favourite wife (2 Chronicles 11:20-22), whose idolatrous tastes were displayed under Asa (2 Chronicles 15:16), was not without a pernicious effect on Rehoboam\" (Wordsworth).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And there were also Sodomites [קָדֵשׁ, a collective noun = הַקְּדֵשִׁים (1 Kings 15:12) = consecrated persons or devotees, because they were set apart to the service of Astarte, the Dea Syria. It is clear from Deuteronomy 23:18 (Heb.) that male prostitutes are here spoken of, the name of the female being קְדֵשָׁה. The former is described in ver. 19 50.c. as a dog, the latter as a whore] in the land [cf. 1 Kings 15:12. It is highly probable that these infamous persons were of Canaanite or Phoenician origin (this being a Phoenician superstition, Movers, \"Phoniz.\" 1:671), but it is somewhat precarious to found an assertion to that effect on these last words (as Bahr)], and [Heb. omits and] they did according to all the abominations of the nations [see Leviticus 18:20; Deuteronomy 18:9-12] which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel.

Retribution seems to have overtaken Judah sooner than Israel. They had the less excuse, and they seem to have plunged deeper into idolatry and immorality (see Homiletics, p. 335)] of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt [to whom Jeroboam had fled (1 Kings 11:26, 40)] came up against Jerusalem. [This expedition is related with somewhat more of detail in 2 Chronicles 12:2-4. For Shishak, see 1 Kings 11:40. It was in the twentieth year of his reign that Shishak, once Jeroboam's protector and friend, invaded Palestine. It has been conjectured (Ewald, al.) that he was incited so to do by Jeroboam, and that the two kings waged war against Judah in concert (see on ver. 30). But as to this Scripture is silent; and moreover if Jeroboam summoned Shishak to his assistance, it is certain that his own kingdom did not altogether escape invasion; and it is perhaps more probable that the divided and weakened state of the country seemed to promise the Egyptian king an easy capture of Jerusalem, of the treasures of which he had doubtless heard. It is well known that a record of this expedition exists in the sculptures and inscriptions of the great temple at Karnak. The bassi relievi of the temple wall contain over 130 figures, representatives, as the names on the shields show, of so many conquered cities. Amongst these are found three of the \"cities for defence\" which Rehoboam had built, viz., Shoco, Adoraim, and Aijalon (2 Chronicles 11:7-10), while many other towns of Palestine, such as Gibeon, Taanach, Shunem, Megiddo, etc., are identified with more or less of probability. One feature in the list is remarkable, viz., the number of Levitical and Canaanite cities - cities of Israel - which Shishak is said to have conquered. The usual inference is that such cities, although in Jeroboam's dominions, had nevertheless held out against his rule - the former for religious reasons; the latter, perhaps, in the effort to recover their independence. Mr. Peele, however (Dict. Bib., art. \"Egypt\" ), accounts for the names on the supposition that Shishak directed, his forces against the northern as well as the southern kingdom, and certainly this seems to agree better with the facts. It is hardly likely that Jeroboam, with the army at his command, would tolerate so many centres of disaffection in his midst. Besides, the Levites, we are told, had migrated in a body to Judah; and the Canaanites at this period can hardly have been in a position to defy any Hebrew monarch.

The state visits of the Sultan to the Mosque may perhaps be best compared with these processions. Ewald sees in this circumstance a proof of Rehoboam's vanity. The brazen shields were \"borne before him in solemn procession, as if everything were the same as before\"], and brought them back into the guard chamber [Heb.\" chamber of the runners.\" Solomon's golden shields were kept \"in the house of the forest of Lebanon\" (1 Kings 10:17).

And his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. [Same words as in ver. 21. The repetition can hardly be, as Bahr, Wordsworth, al., imagine, designed, in order to show that the worship of Moloch was brought by her to Jerusalem (1 Kings 11:7), and that she exercised a sinister influence upon her son. As she is twice called \"the Ammonitess\" it can hardly be doubted that she was one of the \"Ammonitesses\" (1 Kings 11:1, Hebrews) who turned away Solomon's heart; and it is also certain that Rehoboam did not inherit his folly from his father. At the same time these words are more easily accounted for on the supposition that the historian found them in this position in one or more of the documents from which he compiled his history. It is also to be remembered that some of these chronological statements are manifestly by a later hand, and have been transferred from the margin to the text. See on 1 Kings 6:1.] And Abijam [elsewhere called Abijah (2 Chronicles 12:16; 2 Chronicles 13:1), or Abijahu (2 Chronicles 13:21, Hebrews) Some MSS. have Abijah here. The variation is not easily accounted for except as a clerical error. The supposition of Lightfoot that the name was designedly altered by the historian to avoid the incorporation of the sacred JAH into the name of a bad man is too fanciful, the more so as Abijam was by no means an exceptionally bad king. It is, however, approved by Bahr and Rawlinson. But it is as little probable that Abijam is the original form of the name (Keil). The form Abijahu, the LXX. Ἀβιού, and the analogy of Abiel (1 Samuel 9:1) all make against this idea. On the whole, it is more likely that Abijam results from an error of transcription, ה and the final ם being easily confounded] his son reigned in his stead.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, reigned Abijam [see note on 1 Kings 14:31. It is implied in 2 Chronicles 11:20-22 that he was not the firstborn among Rehoboam's twenty-eight sons, but the eldest son of the favourite wife. As he left behind him thirty-eight children (2 Chronicles 13:21) at his decease, some three years later, he must have been of considerable age at his accession. This consideration rather favours the idea that Rehoboam was \"forty and one years old when he began to reign\" (2 Chronicles 12:13)] over Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThree years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Three years [The Alex. LXX. says δεκὰεξ, sixteen. The\" three years\" are not to be interpreted strictly. As he ascended the throne in the eighteenth and died in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign, he cannot have completed three years. But it does not follow that \"he cannot have reigned much more than two years\" (Rawlinson, and similarly Keil). He may have reigned all but three] reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah [in 2 Chronicles 13:2 called Michaiah, Heb. Michajahu. That the same person is meant is proved as well by the context as by 2 Chronicles 11:21, where the name is given as here. Keil (cf. Dict. Bib. 2:162) ascribes the discrepancy to an error of the copyist; but the names are so unlike in the original as to discountenance this assumption. I venture to suggest that Michajahu was the significant form - the word means \"Who is like Jehovah?\" - which the name Maachah, \"oppression,\" borne by the Geshurite princess who married David (2 Samuel 3:3) assumed when she joined the Lord's people, and embraced, as no doubt she would do, the religion of Jehovah. Such a change would be quite in accordance with the genius and traditions of the Semitic races (Genesis 17:5, 15; Genesis 30. passim; 32:28; 41:45; Exodus 6:3, etc. Cf. 2 Kings 23:34; 2 Kings 24:17; Hosea 1:4, 6), and there may well have been special reasons in this case, apart from the piety of David, why it should be made. For the name Maachah appears to have been taken Iron the town and district of that name near Geshur - a part of Syria was called Syria Maachah (1 Chronicles 19:6; cf. 2 Samuel 10:6-8). In 2 Samuel 20:14, 15 we read of a district of Beth Maachah - and it not improbably witnessed to unhappy memories. How natural it would be that David's bride should take a name of better omen and of a religious import, and how natural that the grand-daughter who bore her name should be called by that name in both its forms. Since writing the above, I find that a somewhat similar idea has occurred long since to others. Both Kimchi and Jarchi hold that she had two names. It is supposed by some that she assumed the name Michaiah, as more dignified, on becoming queen. Wordsworth thinks that Michaiah was her real name, and that it was degraded into Maachah when she was deposed for idolatry. This latter view dovetails with the one suggested above. It would be quite in accordance with Jewish usages and habits of thought that the name which had been changed into Michaiah when the grandmother became a proselyte, should be changed back into Maachah when this princess apostatized], the daughter [rather, grand-daughter. בַּת includes all female descendants, as אֵם (see ver. 10) all anxestresses] of Abishalom. We can hardly doubt that Absalom, the son of David, is meant here. We haveNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the express statement of 2 Chronicles 11:21, \"Rehoboam loved Maachah, the daughter of Absalom,\" etc.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The fact that two of Rehoboam's other wives were of the family of David, which shows that it was part of his policy to marry the daughters of that house.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The mother of Absalom was named Maachah (2 Samuel 3:3).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The name is so uncommon - in fact, it is ἅπαξ λεγ - that another person can hardly be intended. Moreover the variation in spelling is extremely slight. It has been held, however, that a different person is designated by the name, principally because Absalom had but one daughter whose name was Tamar (2 Samuel 14:27), whereas Abijah's mother is said to have been the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah (2 Chronicles 13:2). But this difficulty admits of an easy solution. Tamar was doubtless married to Uriel, and Maachah was the fruit of this marriage. And with this explanation agrees the account of Josephus (Ant. 8:10,1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him [sins, i.e., from the theocratic standpoint. See 1 Kings 14:22, 25. It does not appear that either Abijah or Rehoboam was a vicious man, and from his pious language on Mount Zemaraim (2 Chronicles 13:10-12) we should certainly have thought that Abijah was a god-fearing prince. But ver. 13 proves that he had sanctioned idolatry, and this was no doubt his principal sin, as the next words explain]: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord and his God, as the heart of David his father [the words used of Solomon. 1 Kings 2:4].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Nevertheless [נרךדנוס ,דךס ,תעב כִּי, Gesen. 393] for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp [Better than margin, candle.

The stability of the family of David on the throne for nearly 400 years, amid all the changes and chances of that period, and whilst in Israel there were \"nine changes of dynasty within 250 years\" is, as Rawlinson remarks, very \"difficult to account for on mere grounds of human reason\"]:NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5.

Thenius thinks the insertion of the words were due to the carelessness of some copyist, and Bahr admits that our present text is possibly not the original one. For Rehoboam, some MSS., with the Syriac and Arabic, read Abijah, but this is clearly an emendation, which in turn begets another repetition (ver. 7), and there is really no need either to alter or suspect the text. Such repetitions are quite in accordance with Eastern usage, and Rehoboam here stands for the house of Rehoboam, or the cause and kingdom which Rehoboam represented. The object of mentioning his name can hardly be \"to remind the reader that Abijam inherited this war from his father\" (Rawlinson), for it was only on Rehoboam's death that the slumbering hostility blazed out into actual war.

The difficulty by no means admits of a ready solution, but perhaps the best explanation is that the grandmother, Maachah, Rehoboam's favourite wife, retained her position, possibly by force of character, or because Asa's mother was dead. It is not certain, however, that if the latter had lived she would have displaced Maashah, of whose influence and imperious temper we have several indications; e.g., in the appointment of her son, though not the firstborn, to succeed his father, and in her open maintenance of idol worship, and above all in the fact that she was publicly deposed by Asa.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And Ass did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father.

Asherah is not the name of the goddess ( = Astarte), as Wordsworth thinks, but of the image], and Asa destroyed [Marg. cut off, Heb. simply cut, which here must mean cut down. The image was, no doubt, planted erect in the ground] her idol [horror, as above], and burnt it [this shows that it was made of wood] by the brook Kidron. [Cf. Exodus 32:20. Here, as in 1 Kings 17:3 (where see note), our translators have been unable to adhere strictly to the original \"in the brook,\" etc., from not knowing that נַחַל, which primarily means \"brook,\" also means\" watercourse,\" wady. It is probable that the brook was at this time flowing, and that the ashes of the wooden Asherah were cast into it; but the burning also took place in the Wady, or valley. We read of another similar burning in 2 Kings 23:4, 6; but in this case the ashes were either carried to Bethel or cast upon the graves, to defile them. It is a fair inference that on this latter occasion the Kedron was dry. The valley, \"the fields of the Kedron\" (ver. 4 l.c.), is conveniently placed for such a purpose.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But the high places [evidently such as are referred to in ch. 3, i.e., unauthorized shrines of Jehovah; cf. 2 Kings 14:4] were not taken away [lit., departed not. Yet we read in 2 Chronicles 45:3, that Asa \"took away the high places (cf. ver. 5). But it is clear, even from 2 Chronicles 15:17, that all of them were not re moved, and the discrepancy arises from the well-known Eastern idiom of putting the whole for the part, of which we have in stances in Genesis 7:19; Exodus 9:25, etc. Cf. ver. 32; 2 Kings 9:35, and see below. Asa probably aimed at removing all, and he may have removed all out of the cities (2 Chronicles 14:5), but some remained in the country districts or in remote places. Or he may have swept them away for a short time, and they may have been stealthily and gradually reintroduced. It may be interesting to remark here that down to the present day the cultus of the high places exists - under a modified form, it is true - in Palestine. Every traveller will remember the Mukama which crown almost every hill. The religion of the Fellahin, though nominally Mohammedan, is really, like that of China, a worship of the dead. \"In almost every village of the country a small building, surmounted by a whitewashed dome, is observable, being the sacred chapel of the place; it is variously called Kubbeh, \"dome,\" Mazor, \"shrine,\" or Mukam, \"station,\" the latter being a Hebrew word, used in the Bible for the places of the Canaanites (Deuteronomy 2:2)... Just as in the time of Moses, so now the position chosen for the Mukam is generally conspicuous This Mukam represents the real religion of the peasant\" (Conder, pp. 304 sqq.)]: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the Lord all his days. [We have here a notable instance of the Oriental exaggeration just referred to.

Indeed, it would seem from 2 Chronicles 15:19; 2 Chronicles 16:1, that it was not until the 36th year of Asa's reign that it first broke out. But these numbers have clearly not escaped corruption (see note there), as at the date last mentioned Baasha must have been dead (cf. ver. 33 below).

It was not merely to have an advanced post as a menace to Jerusalem (Rawlinson), but primarily, by its command of the high road, to prevent his subjects from falling away to the kingdom of Judah, or even from going up to Jerusalem to worship; in fact, to isolate Judah and to blockade its capital. That there was a great defection to Ass at this time we know from 2 Chronicles 15:9. This was an exodus which Baasha felt must be checked. Blunt (\"Coincidences,\" pp. 176-8) has happily shown from 2 Chronicles 16:6, etc., how the primary object must have been to \"stop the alarming drainage of all that was virtuous out of their borders.\" Rawlinson sees in the fortification of this place \"the first step towards a conquest of the southern kingdom.\" But as to this the text is silent, or rather it assigns an entirely different reason.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left [LXX. τὸ σὑρεθὲν, which Rawlinson thinks points to a corruption of our text.

Ver. 19 shows it to have been a place of considerable importance. In 2 Chronicles 16:4. it is called Abel Maim, \"the meadow of the waters,\" not only, it is probable, because of the lake, but of the huge marsh, the Ard el Huleh, which drains into it (see Stanley, l.c.)

This was the northern limit of the southern kingdom (2 Kings 23:8). It occupied a striking position, standing on a rocky knoll on the south side of the great gorge of Michmash (now known as the Wady Suweinit), a \"great crack or fissure in the country, with vertical precipices some 800 feet high\" (Conder, p. 254; cf. Dict. Bib., 1. p. 658 and Porter, 1. p. 214). As Geba would command the pass, it is easy to understand why Asa fortified it, the more so as this defile \"appears to have been more than once the meeting place between the Jews and their enemies\" (Conder)], and Mizpah. [Heb. the Mizpah, i.e., watch tower (Genesis 31:49). The name points to an eminence, but it is remarkable that while so many sites of minor importance have been recovered, this old gathering place of the tribes (Judges 21:1; 1 Samuel 7:5; 1 Samuel 10:17-25), and the seat of Gedaliah's government (Jeremiah 40:6), cannot be identified with certainty. It has been conjectured that it is now represented by the commanding eminence of Nebi Samwil (Robinson, 2 p. 328; Van de Velde, 2 p. 53),but Stanley (S. and P., 2. p. 213-4) and Grove (Dict. Bib., 2 p. 389) argue in favour of Seopus, and \"the survey has done little to throw light on this question\" (see Conder, pp. 257-9). It is to be hoped that the \"pit,\" or well, which Asa made (Jeremiah 41:9), probably \"to provide Mizpah with a plentiful supply of water in ease of a siege\" (Ewald), may yet be brought to light.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

Nevertheless [Heb. only. There was one exception to his otherwise happy and prosperous reign] in the time of his old age [see notes on 1 Kings 1:1; 11:4. \"Old age\" means here, as them, the end of life. Asa cannot well have been more than fifty. It was in the 39th year of his reign (2 Chronicles 16:12) that this disease attacked him] he was diseased in his feet. [It is generally supposed that this disease was the gout. In the Chronicles (l.c.) he is reproached for seeking \"not to the Lord but to the physicians.\" We must remember what the art of medicine at that day was like (see Kitto, \"Daily Bib.

THE REIGNS OF NADAB, BAASHA, ELAH, ZIMRI, AND OMRI, KINGS OF ISRAEL. - After bringing up the history of the kings of Judah, which has engaged his pen since 1 Kings 14:21, to the date of the death of Asa, our author goes back some forty years to record the contemporary history of the kingdom of Israel, with which the rest of this book, the last thirteen verses alone excepted, is occupied. On the other hand, none of these reigns are even noticed by the chronicler, who only refers to the history of Israel, so far as it is inextricably connected with the object of his work; in other words, so far as is necessary to explain or illustrate the reigns of the kings of Judah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And Nadab [ = liberal] the son of Jeroboam began to reign [Heb. reigned] over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah and reigned over Israel two years. [The reigns of these five kings of Israel are related with great brevity. It was not the object of the author to chronicle secular history - for this he refers us to \"the books of the days\" - he is only concerned with the events of their reigns in so far as they relate to the kingdom of God.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his father [Jeroboam begat all his sons, save one, \"in his own likeness\"], and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. [I.e., not the rebellion, but the schism (1 Kings 12:30; 1 Kings 14:16; cf. vers. 30, 34; 16:2, 13, 19, etc.; see Homiletics, p. 274).

Or it may owe its insertion to the insignificance of this tribe (Genesis 49:14, 15) up to this date. This change of dynasty, unlike the last, was in no way connected with tribal jealousies. Baasha owed his elevation to his own abilities or to his unscrupulous daring], conspired [The word implies associates. There was a plot formed fur Nadab's assassination] against him: and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon [ = eminence. In the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:44) and a Levitical city: one of the four assigned to the Levites in the territory of that tribe (ib., 21:23). It has not been identified. Evidently it was on the border of Philistia. Some would connect it with the modern Mejdel, a little to the north of Ascalon. The reader will observe how large a number of the names of towns indicate their elevation. The cities of those days were set on a hill. It was dangerous to build in the plain], which belonged to the Philistines [Blunt suggests (\"Coincidences,\" p. 181) that it was because the place had been deserted by the Levites, in the general exodus to Judah, that the Philistines availed themselves of the opportunity to seize and fortify it.

It is obvious that if Nadab succeeded to the throne in the second (ver. 25) and died in the third year of Asa, he cannot have reigned two full years] king of Judah did Baasha slay him [As the assassination took place during the siege, it is extremely probable that Baasha, like Omri, was the captain of the host], and reigned in his stead. [Probably Nadab had showed himself quite unequal to the task of governing, of which reading the army was in that age a principal function (1 Samuel 8:20). It is just possible that in the occupation of Gibbethon by Philistines we have a proof of his feebleness and incapacity. Anyhow, when the strong hand of Jeroboam is removed, the fruits of the rebellion at once begin to appear. The contempt and defiance which Jeroboam had showed towards constituted authority are now manifested towards his successor. Baasha only takes a leaf out of Jeroboam's book (1 Kings 11:26).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And it cams to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed [Same expression in Joshua 11:14; cf.

Males and females alike were destroyed; see 1 Kings 14:11], until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the Lord, which he spake by his servant AhiJah the Shilonite [1 Kings 14:10. It is not implied that it was because of this prophecy that Baasha exterminated the house of Jeroboam. It is probable that, so far from setting himself to fulfil it, he knew nothing about it, and, as he thought, merely took effectual measures for his own security. His seat could never be safe, so long as one of Jeroboam's house survived.

It is held by others, however, that for Baasha we should here read Nadab, and in favour of this view is the fact that the reign of Nadab is still under consideration, the history of Baasha only beginning with the following verse.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign [Practically a repetition of ver. 28.

Keil and Bahr hold that it is designed to guard against a perversion of ver. 2, \"I made thee prince,\" etc., from which it might be inferred that he was commissioned of God to murder Nadab. But it is simpler to suppose that his primary idea was to convey, by this repetition, which no doubt is derived from a different source from the statement of ver. 2, that Baasha was visited by God for his various sins.

It is really an aorist = succeeded to the throne] seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped [Heb. encamping] against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Phistines. [It has at first sight a suspicious look that two kings of Israel, within an interval of about twenty-five years, should have been slain by conspirators during a siege of this place. But when the narrative is examined, its probability and consistency become at once apparent. Stanley assumes that the siege lasted over the whole of this period, but it is more likely that when Baasha found himself king, he discovered that he had domestic matters enough upon his hands, without a foreign war, and so he raised the siege. It is very probable that he feared opposition such as Zimri and Omri subsequently experienced. And his wars with Asa and with Syria may well have prevented his renewing the undertaking. On the accession of Elah, however, with the usual ambition and impetuosity of youth, it was decided to recommence the siege and to win this city back for Israel. But the fate of Nadab, and the consequent ill omen attaching to the place would not be forgotten, and this, as well as his voluptuous habits, may have deterred the faineant Elah from besieging it in person, while the conspiracy which marked the former siege may at the same time have suggested to Zimri and others the thought of conspiring against Elah.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel [obviously, all the army. Cf. 1 Kings 12:1, 16, 18] made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. It was hardly likely they would submit to the usurpation of Zimri. Not only had he occupied a subordinate position, but his murder of all Elah's friends must have made him a host of enemies in the camp. It was the natural thing for them, therefore, to turn to Omri. He had the advantage of being in possession. The captain of the host stood next to the king (2 Kings 4:13; 2 Samuel 5:8; 2 Samuel 19:13; 2 Samuel 20:23), and twice stepped into his place (2 Kings 9:5). This history has many parallels in that of the Roman empire.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And Omri went up from Gibbethon [\"The expression, 'went up,' accurately marks the ascent of the army from the Shephelah, where Gibbethon was situated, to the hill country of Israel, on the edge of which Tirzah stood\" (Rawlinson)], and all Israel [see on ver. 16] with him, and they besieged Tirzah. [It is probable that they arrived before the city on the sixth or seventh day after the assassination of Elah. This period would just allow sufficient time for the news of the conspiracy to travel to Gibbethon and for the march of the army.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken [the meaning is probably that which Josephus gives: \"When he saw that the city had none to defend it,\" or possibly, \"when he saw that a breach was made\"], that he went into the palace [אַרְמון citadel, fortress, from תךעט סעתלא אָרַם. So Gesen., Keil, Bight, al. The palace, no doubt, consisted of a string of buildings (1 Kings 7:2-9) of which this was the highest and strongest part. Ewald thinks that the harem - a word which has almost the same radicals ? or women's apartment, is meant - the most secluded portion of the great palace (Josephus understands it to mean \"the inmost part\"), and hence infers, as also from 2 Kings 9:31, that the women of the palace had willingly submitted to the effeminate murderer of their lord, and that even the queen-mother had made advances towards him (vol. 4. p. 36). But, as Bight remarks there is nothing of this in the text, and Zimri's desperate act rather shows daring and contempt of death than effeminacy or sensuality. And 2 Kings 15:25 (cf. Psalm 122:7) seems to point to a stronghold rather than a seraglio] of the king's house, and burnt the king's house [probably the palace which Jereboam had built. Ewald thinks it was this structure gave Tirzah its reputation for beauty; Song of Solomon 6:4] over him with fire [According to the Syriac, the besiegers set fire to the palace. Similarly Jarchi. But the text is decisive. The parallel deed of Sardanapalus will occur to all readers. Rawlinson also refers to Herod. 1:176, and 7:107], and died. [This word is intimately connected with the verse following. But there is no need to rearrange the verses. The text, as it stands, conveys clearly enough that Zimri's tragical death was a retribution for his sins. Bahr remarks that of Elah and Zimri we learn nothing, apart from the fact that they held to the sin of Jeroboam, except how they died.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. [It is quite clear that in his reign of one week Zimri cannot have done much to show his complicity in the schism of Jeroboam, and it is probable that the sacred writer means that his character and antecedents were such as to prove that all his sympathies were with the irreligious party. Bahr thinks that he had \"formerly displayed much partiality for the calf worship.\" But it is quite as likely that the idea in the historian's mind was that all these events were the bitter fruits of Jeroboam's misguided and impious policy, into the spirit of which, Zimri, like his predecessors, had been baptized. It is interesting to remember here the aspect these repeated revolutions and assassinations would wear to the kingdom of Judah, then enjoying quietness and prosperity under Asa. We cannot doubt for a moment that they were regarded as so many manifestations of the righteous judgment of God, and as the outcomes of that spirit of insubordination and impiety which, in their eyes, had brought about both the division of the kingdom and the schism in the church.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Now the rest of the acts of Zimri [We see here the tendency of the historian to express himself in formulae. He checks himself, however, and does not add \"and all that he did,\" etc.], and his treason that he wrought [Heb. his conspiracy which he conspired. Though this was all there was to tell of him, yet no doubt it would be recorded at greater length by the historians of the day. We can hardly suppose that the \"books of the words of the days\" would dismiss so striking an event in a few sentences], are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? The Interregnum.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: halt of the people followed [lit., was after. Same expression 2 Samuel 2:10; cf. 1 Kings 1:7] Tibni the son of Ginath [Who he was, or why he was set up in opposition to Omri, it is impossible to say. It has been supposed that the army was divided in its preferences, and that part of the soldiery wished to make Tibni king, and this is perhaps the most probable conjecture. It is to be considered that the entire army was not encamped before Gibbethon. Nor are vers. 16, 17 fatal to this view, as Bahr maintains, because \"all Israel\" there clearly means all the army under the command of Omri. It is hardly likely that Tibni was set up by the people of Tirzah, after the death of Zimri, to continue the struggle. The only thing that is certain is that,the hereditary principle being overthrown, the crown appeared to be the legitimate prize of the strongest; and Tibni, who may have occupied a position of importance, or have had, somehow, a considerable following, resolved that Omri should not wear it without a fierce contest], to make him king [Omri had been already made king, i.e., anointed, ver. 16]; and half renewed Omri.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath [It appears, however, from the following verse that the struggle lasted four years]: so Tibni died [According to Jos., Ant. 8:12. § 5, he was slain by the conqueror. The LXX. has here a curious and probably genuine addition. \"And Thabni died, and Joram his brother at that time], and Omri reigned. [The jingle of the Hebrew words is probably designed.] The Reign of Omri.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - In the thirty and first year of Asa, king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years [As Omri was proclaimed king in the twenty-seventh and died in the thirty-eighth year of Asa (cf. vers. 15, 29), he cannot in any case have reigned twelve full years; whereas if his reign is to be dated, as it is here, from the thirty-first year of Asa, it is obvious that he would only have reigned seven, or, according to the Jewish mode of reckoning, eight years. Rawlinson proposes to get over the difficulty by rearranging the text. He would attach the first clause of this verse to ver. 22, and read, \"And Omri reigned in the thirty-first,\" etc. But to this there are two serious objections. First, that ver. 23, as it now stands, only follows the usual formula with which a new reign is announced (cf. vers. 8, 15, 29); and, second, it is extremely doubtful whether any prose sentence in the Hebrew ever begins as ver. 23 would then do, \"Reigned Omri over Israel twelve years.\" Such a sentence would certainly be quite alien to the usus loquendi of our author. We are therefore reduced to the conclusion eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the text here, as in some other instances (1 Kings 6:1; 2 Kings 1:17; cf. 3:1; 13:1, 10, etc.), has suffered at the hands of a reviser, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the numbers have been corrupted in transcription; orNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that the historian expresses himself in a somewhat confused way. Of these suppositions perhapsNEWLINENEWLINE(1) is the most likely. Anyhow, it is clear that the twelve years of Omri's reign are to be counted not from the thirty-first, but from the twenty-seventh year of Asa, i.e., from the date of Zimri's death (see vers. 10, 15, 29). The confusion has arisen from the fact that it was not until Tibni was slain, after four years of conflict, that Omri became sole ruler]: six years reigned he in Tirzah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. ? And he bought [i.e., after the six years just mentioned. During the four years of anarchy Omri would seem to have retained possession of the capital which he had taken (ver. 18) on Zimri's death. But the palace being burnt and the defences perhaps weakened by the siege, he determined, rather than rebuild it, to found a capital elsewhere] the hill Samaria [Heb. Shomeron, called by Herod Sebaste, whence its modern name Sebustieh. In his selection of Samaria for the seat of government, Omri acted with singular judgment. It has been said that \"Shechem is the natural capital of Palestine,\" and no doubt it enjoys a commanding position and great advantages, but Samaria has even superior recommendations. It is a site with which no traveller can fail to be deeply impressed. Even Van de Velde, who says, \"I do not agree with Dr. Robinson and other writers who follow him that the mountain of Samaria presents so admirable a combination of strength, fertility, and beauty, that the like is hardly to be found in Palestine\" (vol. 1. pp. 374, 375), nevertheless readily allows its superiority to Tirzah, and remarks on the strength of its position. \"Many travellers have expressed a conviction that the spot was in most respects much preferable to the site of Jerusalem\" (Kitto). It is a large oval or oblong mound, with a level surface, adapted for buildings, with steep sides to make its position impregnable, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. \"Samaria is in a position of great strength., and must before the invention of gunpowder have been almost impregnable. It stands some 400 feet above the valley, the sides of the hill being steep and terraced in every direction for cultivation, or perhaps for defensive purposes.. broad and open valleys stretch north and south, and the hill is thus almost isolated,\" Conder, p. 47, who adds, \"Strategical reasons may be supposed to have dictated the choice of the capital of Omri, for on the north the hill commands the main road to Jezreel over a steep pass, on the west it dominates the road to the coast, and on the east that to the Jordan\" (p. 49). Grove (Dict. Bib. 3:1099) speaks of \"the singular beauty of the spot,\" and Stanley (\"Jewish Church\" it. p. 284) justly sees in the selection of this spot a proof of Omri's sagacity. But perhaps the best proof is that which the subsequent history supplies. Shechem and Tirzah had each been tried, and each in turn had been abandoned. But Samaria continued to be the capital so long as the kingdom lasted] of Shemer for two talents of silver [variously estimated at £500 and £800. This purchase, obviously of the freehold, i.e., in perpetuity, was in contravention of the law of Leviticus 25:23. David had bought the threshing floor of Ornan, but that wasNEWLINENEWLINE(1) from a Jebusite, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) for a high religious purpose (2 Samuel 24:24).NEWLINENEWLINEIt has been suggested that this purchase may have inspired Ahab with the idea of buying the vineyard of Naboth], and built on [Heb. built] the hill and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. [It is not improbable that the vendor bargained that the land should retain his name (cf. Psalm 49:11). The reluctance of the Israelite to part with his patrimony, even to the king, is brought out very strikingly in ch. 21. Shemer, in selling his choice parcel of land for a capital, might well wish to connect his name with it. The fact that שֹׁמְרון means watch mountain (Gesen.), and that we should have expected a name formed from Shemer to take the form Shimron - Shomeron would strictly imply an original Shomer - is not by any means a proof that our historian is at fault in his derivation. For, in the first place, the names Shomer and Shemer are used of the same person in 1 Chronicles 7:32, 34. And secondly, nothing would be more in accordance with Jewish ideas than that Omri, in naming the hill after its owner, should give a turn to the word which would also express at the same time its characteristic feature. A pun, or play upon word, was the form which wit assumed amongst the Semitic races (as, indeed, is the case still, see Conder, p. 801), and the form Shomeron would at once perpetuate the memory of Shemer, and express the hope and purpose of Omri. It is a curious fact that the later Samaritans did play upon this very word, representing themselves as guardians (שֹּׁמְרִים) of the law (Ewald). The Greek form of the name, Σαμάρεια, would seem to have been derived through the Chaldee שִׁמְרָיִן as found in Ezra 4:10, 17.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him. [It has been thought that Micah 6:16 (\"the statutes of Omri, etc.\") points to a fresh departure from the Jewish faith; to the organization of the calf worship into a regular formal system, or to \"measures for more competely isolating the people of Israel from the services of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem\" (Kitto).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed [Not only in the war with Tibni, but certainly in the subjugation of the Moabites, of which mention is made in the recently discovered Moabite stone. He may well have had other wars, which, like this, have escaped notice in Scripture. If the king of Syria spoke truly (1 Kings 20:34), the war with that power had been extremely disastrous. Yet the Assyrian inscriptions prove that Omri's name was more widely and permanently known in the East than those of his predecessors or successors. Samaria, for example, down to the time of Tiglath-Pileser, appears as Beth Khumri, the \"house of Omri;\" Athaliah,the daughter of Ahab, is called a daughter of Omri; and Jehu appears in the Black Obelisk Inscription as \"the son of Omri\" (Rawlinson, \"Hist. Illus. of O.T.,\" pp. 111-12). It is perhaps an evidence of \"his might\" that his dynasty retained the throne to the third generation], are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

THE REIGN OF AHAB. - With the accession of Ahab a new main section of our history begins - the section which has its close in the destruction of the house of Omri by Jehu, as related in 2 Kings 10. And this reign is recorded at unusual length; in fact, it occupies nearly all the remaining portion of this volume, whereas the reigns of preceding kings have in several instances been dismissed in a few verses. It owes this distinction to the ministry of the great prophet Elijah by which it was marked, and, indeed, was profoundly influenced; but this ministry, it must be remembered, was necessitated by the critical circumstances of the time. It may be that \"every age thinks itself a crisis,\" but no one can fail to see that this was one of the veritable turning points of Jewish history. One of the real \"decisive battles of the world\" - that between the Lord and Baal - was then fought out. No wonder that our historian felt constrained to chronicle at length the transactions of a reign so pregnant both with good and evil for the people of the Lord and for the faith with which they had been put in trust. Indeed, the same guiding principle which led him to devote so many of his pages to the reign of Solomon, when the theocratic kingdom was at its highest, impelled him to linger over the reign of Ahab when religion was at its lowest ebb. The secular historian, too often like the sundial which \"counts no hours save those serene,\" draws a veil over the time of his country's decadence, or touches its misfortunes with a light hand. It is only in the inspired records that we have an impartial register both of the glory and shame of a common. wealth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah [see notes on ver. 23] began Ahab [\"Father's brother.\" The name is apposite.

It is possible that the preceding verse has been revised by a chronologer. The LXX. text is much more condensed] did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. [The same words are used of his father in ver. 25. It is not difficult to see in what way Ahab's rule was worse even than Omri's. The latter had gone beyond his predecessors in the matter of the calf worship. See note on ver. 25. But the calf worship, however it may have deteriorated in process of time - and it is the tendency of such systems to wax worse and worse - was nevertheless a cult, though a corrupt, and unauthorized, and illicit cultus, of the one true God. Under Ahab, however, positive idolatry was established and fostered the worship of foreign and shameful deities.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him [Heb. as marg. was it a light thing? Ewald (362 a) explains this to mean \"because it was.\" But it seems better to understand, \"was it such a light thing... that he must needs also?\" etc.] to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat [i.e., the sins of heresy and schism], that he took to wife Jezebel [ = \"Without cohabitation,\" \"chaste,\" Gesenius, who compares it with Agnes. It is hardly the original of Isabella] the daughter of Ethbaal [ = \"With Baal.\" The Greek form Ἰθόβαλος or Αἰθώβαλος, found in Jos., Ant. 8:13.1; cf. Contr. Ap. 1:18, suggests as its original אִתּו בַּעַל i.e., \"with him is Baal.\" In either case the name well became him, for, according to Menander (apud Jos. l.c.), he was the priest of Astarte, who gained for himself the throne of the Zidonians by the assassination of Pheles. He is further said to have reigned thirty-two years, and to have lived sixty-eight years. He would therefore be thirty-six years old at the time of his accession. It does not appear that (Keil) he was the brother of Pheles. Pheles, however, was certainly a fratricide. (Rawlinson reminds us that Jezebel was great-aunt to Pygmalion and Dido.) This statement helps to explain Jezebel's fierce and sanguinary character, and at the same time accounts for her great devotion to the gods of her country, and for her determined efforts to establish their impure rites in her husband's kingdom. It was only what one would expect from the child of such a parent] king of the Zidonians [This alliance, it is extremely probable, was made for purely political reasons, as a counterpoise against the active, ambitious, and encroaching power which had arisen in Damascene Syria.

It had evidently passed, however, at this date into the possession of Israel. It has been suggested that the transference took place in the reign of Baasha (Rawlinson). But it would seem that from the very first, parts of Benjamin (notably Bethel, Joshua 18:13) belonged to the northern kingdom. See Ewald, \"Hist. Israel,\" 4:2, 3. It is not quite clear whether the rebuilding of Jericho is mentioned as a proof of the daring impiety of that age and of the utter contempt with which the warnings of the law were treated, or as showing the ignorance and consequent disregard of law which prevailed. But, on the whole, it seems to be implied that Hiel knew of the threatening of Joshua, and treated it with defiance. It has been suggested that the rebuilding had really been instigated by Ahab, and for his own purposes, hoping thereby to \"secure to himself the passage across the Jordan\" (Keil), but the text affords but slight warrant for this conjecture]: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn [i.e., at the cost of, in the life of, Abiram], and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord [Joshua 6:26], which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

It is so singularly appropriate to the man who bore it, and so exactly expresses the idea of his life and the chapter of his work (see especially 1 Kings 18:39), that it is difficult to resist the belief that it was assumed by him. This is certainly more probable than that it was due to the prescience of his parents. It may, however, mark their piety and hopes, and may have influenced the life of their son. Cf. 1 Chronicles 4:10], the Tishbite [So he is called without any further designation in 1 Kings 21:17; 2 Kings 1:8, 8, etc. The presumption is altogether in favour of תשבי being the name of his birthplace. (Cf. 1 Kings 11:29], who was of the inhabitants of Gilead [The interpretation of these words is much disputed. The Heb. stands גִלְעָד הַתִּשְׁבִּי מִתּשָׁבֵי It will be the first and second words have the same radicals, and it hits been inferred that they cannot mean \"two entirely distinct things\" (Rawlinson cf.) and that either the Masoretic pointing must be set aside, when the words would yield the meaning, \"Elijah, the Tishbite of Tishbe of Gilead\" or they must be interpreted \"Elijah the stranger of the strangers of Gilead.\" But it is by no certain that the current interpretaioni not the best. Such a play upon words as it involves is not at all uncommon in Hebrew. The meaning would then be that Elijah , who was, if not by birth, by domicile, of Tishbe, was one of the strangers - תּושִׁב is found in the sense of πάροικος, inquilinus, in Genesis 23:4; Exodus 12:45; Leviticus 22:10; Leviticus 25:35, 47, etc. - or immigrants who had settled in Gilead. The only objection to this rendering - apart from the identity of radicals just mentioned - is that we should have expected to find תּשָׁבֵי written plene, as the word always is elsewhere. It is alleged by Keil, Bahr, al., however, that the stat. constr. plur. may well be an exception to the rule, and in support of this view it may be mentioned that the cognate word, יושֵׁב, is constantly found in the constr, plural as ישְׁבֵי (see Gesen., Thessalonians 635). It is clear, then, that the usual interpretation is by no means to be lightly set aside. It is certainly preferable to the rendering, \"Elijah the stranger,\" etc., for we have no proof that הַתִּשְׁבִּי can bear this meaning. In favour of the alternative rendering \"the Tishbite of Tishbe,\" it may be said that it has the support of the LXX., ὁ ἐκ Θεσβῶν, and of Josephus (Ant. 8:13. 2), ἐκ πόλεως Θεσδώνης τῆς Γαλααδίτιδος χώρας. Nor is it any weighty objection to this view that we now here read of a Tishbe in Gilead: as for the matter of that, we have no undoubted traces of any such place west of the Jordan; the passage in Tobit (ch. 1:2, LXX.), which is often alleged as proving that there was a Tishbe in Galilee, and from which Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, etc., conclude that this must be the Tishbi here referred to, being too uncertain to permit us to build any positive conclusions thereupon. See Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1489, 1516. In any case - and it is perhaps impossible to decide positively between this and the rendering of the A.V. - it is clear that Elijah, even if born in Galilee (but see John 7:52, for the belief of the Jews), was trained for his work in Gilead. It was, therefore, a rugged, unsettled, half-civilized, trans-Jordanic region gave to the world the greatest of its prophets. In this respect he was like Moses (Exodus 3:1), and his antitype the Baptist (Luke 1:80). \"The fact that this mission was entrusted not to a dweller in royal city or prophetic school, but to a genuine child of the deserts and forests of Gilead, is in exact accordance with the dispensations of Providence in other times\" (Stanley)] said unto Ahab [The abrupt way in which Elijah appears upon the scene without a word of introduction or explanation is certainly remarkable. Ewald observes that \"his first entry within the province of the history seems almost as unique and inexplicable as his final disappearance.\" \"Elijah comes in with a tempest, and goes out with a whirlwind\" (Hall). But there is no sufficient ground for believing (Thenius, al.) that a part of our history which described some of his antecedents has been lost to us, or that our text merely recites the issue of a long conference which Elijah had held with Ahab, for other prophets of this period, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Jehu, are introduced to us in a similar manner, though it must be allowed that their respective ministries were of very different proportions and importance from Elijah's. This sudden appearance, however, is thoroughly characteristic of the man. He presently disappears just as suddenly (ver. 5. Cf. 19:3; 2 Kings 1:8). It was thought by some in that age that he was borne hither and thither by the Spirit of God! 1 Kings 18:12), and men of a later time caught this as one of his prominent characteristics (Ecclus. 48:1-12). Hence, too, the traditions of a still later period, according to which he was \"the fiery Phinehas returned to earth, or an angel hovering on the outskirts of the world,\" Stanley], As the Lord God of Israel liveth [This formula here occurs for the first time, and it is full of meaning. It asserts first that Jehovah, not Baal, is the God of Israel, and it suggests, in the second place, that he is the living God, such as Baal was not, and that though ordinarily He keeps silence, He is one who can make His power felt], before whom I stand [i.e., \"Whose I am and whom I serve\" (Acts 27:23). Cf. 1 Kings 18:15. The slaves of the East stood before their masters. See note on 1 Kings 1:28, and cf. 1 Samuel 3:1; Luke 1:19. Elijah claims to speak in God's name, and as His ambassador], there shall not be dew nor rain [Observe the order of the words. Dew is perhaps put first as more essential to vegetable life. Elijah only denounces a plague already threatened in the law as the punishment of idolatry (Deuteronomy 11:16, 17; Deuteronomy 28:23; Leviticus 26:19). He came forward as the vindicator and restorer of the law] these years [An indefinite period. Its duration depended on Elijah's word, and that again on the penitence, etc., of the people. It was because of the obduracy of king and people that it lasted so long] but according to my word. [The idolatrous priests no doubt claimed for Baal the dominion over nature and absolute control over the clouds and rain - a power which, it may be worth observing, the monks of the convent of St. Katherine at Sinai, where Elijah was, are thought to possess by the Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula. Elijah directly challenges them to a trial of strength. It was as if he had said, \"The God that answereth by rain, let him be God.\" On the fitness of this miracle, both as a sign and as a punishment, see \"Homil. Quart.\" 5:100,101. \"To Eastern and Southern nations, where life and water go always together, where vegetation gathers round the slightest particle of moisture and dies the moment it is withdrawn...the withholding of rain is the withholding of pleasure, of sustenance, of life itself \" (Stanley). \"My word\" is somewhat emphatic, \"Nisi ego, et non alius vir... dixero \" (Seb. Schmidt). No doubt there is a special reference to the prophets of Baal. Their inability to remove the ban would prove the impotency of their god. Elijah had asked for the supernatural powers which he here claims (James 5:17, 18).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying [cf. ver. 8; 1 Kings 18:1; 1 Kings 21:17; 2 Kings 1:3],NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGet thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Get thee hence, and turn thee [for the construction (dat. commodi) cf.

But the word would be specially appropriate, if the Cherith was beyond Jordan. Ewald, indeed, holds that our text is decisive on this point], and hide thyself [Heb. be hid, i.e., lie hid, Niphal. It does not seem to have occurred to the prophet that such a calamity as he had denounced against the country almost made his disappearance from the scene a necessity, or if it did, he still waited for instructions. Cf. ver. 9; 1 Kings 18:1, etc. Not merely was his flight necessary in order to escape persecution or punishment - the search which Ahab instituted for him in part explains his disappearance - but to avoid importunity. It would have been morally impossible for him, though a man of inflexible will (Bahr) to dwell among the people, while the land groaned under the terrible burden which he had laid upon it, and which he alone was able to remove. His life would not have been safe - see 1 Kings 18:4 - and the ordeal would have been intolerable. And 1 Kings 19:2 shows that the prophet's nature had its weaker side. Wordsworth observes that Elijah's escapes and departures into unknown places are \"faint resemblances of the mysterious vanishings of our blessed Lord, after He had delivered some of His Divine messages which excited the anger of the people;\" Luke 4:29; John 8:59; John 10:39] by [Heb. in] the brook [Heb. נַחַל; i.e., watercourse, wady. This word has two meanings. Its primary meaning is torrent; its secondary and, from the fact that the torrents of the East are for the most part dried up during the greater part of the year, its common meaning is torrent-bed, or ravine, valley. Both meanings are brought out here. Elijah should dwell in and drink of the נַחַל. Cf. 1 Kings 15:3] Cherith [The word means separation, a name which may possibly indicate that it was extremely secluded, or it may have been a boundary line of some sort. Tradition identifies the brook Cherith with the Wady-et-kelt, i.e., the great valley, west of the Jordan, which debouches into the Ghor, half a mile south of Jericho, and Robinson and Porter pronounce in its favour. Van de Velde (2. 310, 311) suggests the Wady Fasael, a few miles to the north. But it is much more probable that it is to be sought in the region east of the Jordan, where, indeed, Eusebius and Jerome place it. It is extremely doubtful whether the Wady-el-kelt, or any Cis-Jordanic ravine, would afford sufficient privacy. Probably Jericho was already rebuilt. As we cannot decide with certainty, we may reasonably conjecture that it is to be sought in Elijah's own country of Gilead, and probably in the Waddy Alias, i.e., at no great distance from Abara (Conder, \"Tent-work,\" p. 230), the Jordan ford nearly opposite Bethshan, where, indeed, an old tradition places it] that is before [Nothing positive can be concluded from עַל פְנֵי.

[The Cherith was clearly one of the lateral valleys which run into the Ghor. It is just possible that the name may be recovered by the survey of the country east of the Jordan, which is now (1880) being organized.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook [There was clearly nothing miraculous about the supply of water. No miracle was wrought even to continue the supply, ver. 7]; and I have commanded [cf. ver. 9; Isaiah 5:6; Amos 9:3, etc.] the ravens to feed thee there. [Despite the general agreement of scholars that by ערבים we must understand \"ravens,\" I think probability favours the meaning Orbites, i.e., inhabitants of Orbo. In support of the received rendering is the very powerful consideration, that it is the interpretation of all the versions (except the Arabic) and of Josephus, who, beyond all question, represented the belief current in his own time (Ant. 8:13. 2). It is also certain that elsewhere in Scripture we find some of the inferior animals supernaturally constrained to effect God's purposes, both of mercy and of judgment (1 Kings 13:24; 2 Kings 2:24; Daniel 6:22; 2 Peter 2:16), though never it must be said, in so rational and methodical a way. Nor can it rightly be contended that the words \"I have commanded,\" צִוִתִי, imply human agency, for elsewhere we find the Almighty commanding (same word) the serpent (Amos 9:3) and the clouds (Isaiah 5:6; Psalm 78:23). It is not, however, a sufficient account of this narrative to say that the prophet merely helped himself to the food which the ravens, whose habitat was in the Wady Cherith, brought, day by day, to their nests and their young. For, not to insist on the words, מְבִיאִים לו bringing to him (ver. 6), the expressions '\" bread (or food, לֶחֶם) and flesh,\" and \"morning and evening\" certainly point to something more than such a fortuitous supply. Whether the Orebim were \"ravens\" or not, they certainly acted in an intelligent and rational way: they brought food, that is to say, to the prophet, and they brought it for months together with unfailing regularity. But against this view the following considerations may be urged.NEWLINENEWLINE1. It is hardly in accord with God's usual way of working, that he should employ birds of the air and those unclean (Leviticus 11:15; Deuteronomy 14:14) and ravenous birds, to feed and succour His saints, rather than men or angels. Of course, no one who does not altogether repudiate the supernatural will deny for a moment that the Almighty could, had it seemed good to Him, have sustained His prophet by the instrumentality of ravens, just as easily as by any other means. But it appears to be almost a fixed principle of His dealings with men, not to resort to miracles when ordinary means will suffice; or if He does employ miracles, they are never bizarre or fantastic; they are not such as to suggest the idea of fable or legend; they are invariably the simplest and directest means to the end. And it is submitted that this prolonged and methodical ministry of ravens is altogether unlike God's method of procedure on other occasions. It was an angel succoured Hagar and Ishmael in their need (Genesis 16:7). It was an angel fed Elijah himself, a few years later (1 Kings 19:5, 6). They were angels who ministered to our blessed Lord after His long fast (Matthew 4:11). But God's,' chief means,\" it is always to be remembered, \"is man.\" And it is to be carefully observed that when, about this very time, not one, but one hundred prophets were threatened, just as Elijah was, with death, no miracle was wrought to save their lives or to supply their wants, but they were fed by human agency, with bread and water (1 Kings 18:13). But it is still more significant that elsewhere in this narrative, which is characterized by the profoundest sobriety and reticence, there is what we may almost call a studied absence of the miraculous element. No miracle is wrought to protect Elijah against Jezebel, but he must consult for his own safety by flight. He is sent to the brook Cherith, because there is water there; in other words, God chose that hiding place in order to obviate the necessity for a miracle. And when the water of the brook dries up, no miracle is wrought to prolong the supply, but the prophet, at the risk of detection, must go forth and seek it elsewhere. And at Zarephath he is fed, not by ravens, but by human agency - by a widow woman. It is true a miracle appears to have been wrought, but the narrative has so little idea of effect and gives so little prominence to the supernatural that even that is doubted. To put the interpretation of \"ravens,\" consequently, on the word ערבים, provided it will yield any other meaning, appears to be to do violence to the spirit of the context, and to the tenour of Scripture generally.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It is somewhat difficult to believe that such a prodigy as this, so altogether unique and irregular, would not have been mentioned, had it really happened, elsewhere in Scripture. The absence of all reference thereto is remarkable, when we consider how constantly the ministry of Elijah and its lessons (Luke 4:25, 26; Luke 9:54; James 5:17; Revelation 11:5, 6) are referred to in the New Testament; but when we observe what an admirable and unequalled illustration of God's providential care this incident would have supplied to some of our Lord's discourses, and notably to that of Luke 12:22 sqq., this silence becomes almost suspicious.NEWLINENEWLINE3. Despite the practical unanimity of the versions, the interpretation \"ravens\" has been disputed from very early times. St. Jerome among Christians, Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh and Kimchi amongst Jews - these are but some of those who have repudiated this rendering.NEWLINENEWLINE4. A very slight change in the vowel points - עַרְבִּים instead of ערְבִים - yields the meaning \"Arabians.\" That a fugitive would readily find, not only shelter but sustenance among the Bedouin, whose generous hospitality and loyalty to strangers is proverbial, is obvious, and we knew that about this time some Arab tribes had dealings with the Jews (2 Chronicles 17:11); but without any change at all, a sufficient meaning may be extracted from the word. For we find that somewhere in the Ciccar, or plain of the Jordan, off which the Wady Cherith lay, was a rock Oreb (עורֵב, Judges 7:25), apparently east of the Jordan (Judges 8:1), but in any case, at no great distance from Bethabara (John 1:28). Now Beth-abara has been identified, almost to a certainty (Conder, \"Tent-work,\" pp. 229-232) with the modern Abarah (i.e., passage or ferry), \"one of the main fords of the Jordan just above the place where the Jalud river flowing down the valley of Jezreel and by Beisan, debouches into Jordan.\" But we learn from an ancient and independent source, the Bereshith Rabba (see Dict. Bib. ii. 464), that in the neighbourhood of Beisan, i.e., Bethshean, there was anciently a town named Orbo, עַרְבו - a word, it is to be observed, which preserves the radicals of עורֵב transposed. We may safely assume that these two places, Orbo and Oreb, were identical; that the former was the representative at a later day of the latter, or was the shape which the name assumed when bestowed on the hamlet, as distinct from the rock. The inhabitants of this place would, of course, be called עֹרְבִים, just as the in. habitants of Ziph were known as Ziphim (1 Samuel 26:1), or the men of Zidon as Zidonim (1 Kings 5:6). We find, consequently, that this word, which means \"ravens,\" also designates the inhabitants of a village near Bethshean, and probably east of the Jordan; that is to say, in or near Elijah's native country of Gilead. And with this agree the testimonies of Rabbi Judah and Jerome already referred to. The former held that the Orebim were not ravens at all, but inhabitants of Orbo or the rock Oreb, while the latter says, with equal positiveness, Orbim, accolae villae in fini-bus Arabum, Eliae dederunt alimenta. It only remains for us to notice the perfect naturalness and consistency of the narrative thus interpreted. Elijah is bidden to go eastward; to hide in the Wady Cherith, where he would be among tribesmen or friends. For water, there is the brook; for food, the Orbites, whose name would be familiar to him, and whom he may have known, are commanded to feed him. He goes; he is received with Arab hospitality; the Eastern law of Dakheel, by which any man at any time is entitled to throw himself upon the mercy and protection of another, ensures his safety. The Orebim minister assiduously to his wants. Every morning before the dawn, every evening after dark, they bring him bread and flesh.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - So he went and did according auto the word of the Lord: for [Heb. and] he went and dwelt by [Heb. in] the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And the ravens brought [Heb. bringing] him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening [the Vat. LXX. has\" bread in the morning and flesh in the evening.\" It has been objected that this verse is fatal to the view advanced above - that the ערבים were not birds but men - that no men would have \"come regularly twice a day,., thus giving themselves needless trouble and increasing the chance of detection, when they might easily have left him a supply for several days\" (Rawlinson). But if we may believe that the prophet was, if not among kinsmen or friends, yet among the pastoral, semi-nomadic people of Gilead, a people, that is to say, like the Bedawin in their instincts and customs, it is easy to understand that having taken him under their protection, they would make a point of visiting him regularly, not only to show him all possible honour, as a person endued with supernatural powers (cf. 1 Kings 18:7, 13), but to afford him some measure of sympathy and companionship. And we can then see a reason for the morning and evening being mentioned. Their visits would be made in the twilight, which is really longer in the East than is generally supposed]; and he drank [Hebrew drinks.

The words no doubt have this force elsewhere, Leviticus 25:29; Judges 11:40; Judges 17:10; 1 Samuel 27:7, etc.; but in all these cases, the meaning is not resident in the words themselves, but in the context. It is impossible to say how long Elijah remained in the Wady. All we can be sure of is that he must have been more than two rears, out of the three and a haft, at Zare-phath. See on 1 Kings 18:1] that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. [גֶּשֶׁם imber, signifies heavy rain.

It lies still, as no doubt it did then, on the high road between Tyre and Sidon, and on the shore. The prophet would thus be in the lion's den, in the very heart of the dominions of Ethbaal. See Porter, 2:397.

But it is fatal to this viewNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the verb is לִקְחִי - the same as already used in the request for water (ver. 10), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that there is no article before bread. \"The bread in thine hand\" would have been clear, but the words as they stand can only mean, \"Bring me, together with the water in the vessel, a morsel of bread in thine hand.\" Besides, \"in thy possession\" would probably have been expressed by \"under thine hand,\" as in 1 Samuel 21:3, 4, 8, though \"in the hand\" is found in Ecclesiastes 5:13; Ezra 7:25, in a somewhat similar sense.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth [Bahr, Keil, al. conclude from this formula that the woman was a worshipper of the God of Israel. Bahr is extremely positive on this point, affirming that, had she been a heathen, the words would have been positively hypocritical, and more, that Elijah would never have been sent (Luke 4:26) to an idolater. He further suggests that possibly she was an Israelite by birth, who had been married to a Phoenician. But all this is extremely doubtful. In the first place, it is noteworthy that the words are, \"Jehovah thy God,\" words which show that she recognized Elijah, perhaps by his Jewish face, probably by his prophetic dress (2 Kings 1:8) as a worshipper of Jehovah. But had she also been the same, it is probable that she would have said \"my God,\" for that form would not only have given greater force to her obtestation, but would have established a bond of sympathy - such as Jews in a foreign land were only too glad to recognize - between them. And the remark that it is hypocrisy to swear by a god in whom one does not believe is disposed of by the consideration that she may well have believed in the Lord as well as in Baal. See note on 1 Kings 5:7. The Tyrians knew nothing of monotheism], I have not a cake [מָעונֹ, the synonym of עֻגָּה (ver. 13), the smallest kind of bread. It was baked in the ashes; hence the LXX. ἐγρυφίας. We gather from this pitiful disclosure that the famine had already extended to Phoenicia, as it naturally would do, considering how dependent that country was on Israel for its breadstuffs; see note on 1 Kings 5:9,11. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 2) cites Menander as attesting to a year's drought in the reign of Ethbaal], but an handful of meal in a [Heb. the] barrel [כַּד, probably connected with cadus, cadeau, etc.; bucket, pail], and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks [i.e., a few sticks (Gesenius). We may compare the German idiom ein Paar and our \"two or three.\" But \"two\" in this sense occurs nowhere else in the Bible - \"two or three\" is found in 2 Kings 9:32; Isaiah 17:6; Amos 4:8. According to Roberts, the word is constantly used for \"few\" by the natives of India. This widow was evidently reduced to the greatest extremities], that I may go in and dress it for me and my son [The LXX. has τέκνοις here and in ver. 13, and τὰ τέκνα in ver. 15. Bahr contends that Elijah first learnt from these words - the mention of a son and the absence of any mention of her husband - that he was addressing a \"widow woman.\" But we read Genesis 38:14, 19, of \"garments of widowhood\" (cf. Deuteronomy 24:17), and ver. 10, \"a widow woman,\" etc., almost implies that Elijah from the first recognized her as such], that we may eat it, and die.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And Elijah said unto her [This looks at first like a further test. But it is pretty clear that the prophet now knew that the widow of whom God had spoken was before him], Fear not; go and do as thou hast said [Heb. according to Shy word] but [Heb. only, however]: make me thereof [Heb. thence, i.e., of the oil as well as the meal. The former took the place of butter. Bread was sometimes baked in oil] a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and thy son. [The \"first\" and \"afterwards\" are emphatic by position. When Bahr says that Elijah would never have made this demand, and that still less would the widow have paid any attention to it, had she been a heathen, he appears to forget the words that followed (ver. 14). When one in the garb of a prophet swore, as this man did, by the sacred name, a heathen, with the belief of the heathen in miracles, might well be persuaded that the word was truth. Elijah's manner alone would carry conviction with it.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For thus saith the Lord God of Israel [The words, \"God of Israel,\" if anything, favour the supposition that he was speaking to one who was not of Israel. See on ver. 1. There the words were addressed to one who was denying the God of Israel] The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fall, until the day that the Lord sendeth [Heb. giveth.

It has been said that there is not a syllable here to imply a miracle, and it has been contended that this Sareptan household was sustained for over two years simply by the blessing of God on the use of natural means. But clearly, if there was nothing else, there was supernatural knowledge on Elijah's part. And it cannot be denied that the literal construction of the words points to a \"supernatural and inexplicable multiplication of food\" (Rawlinson), similar to those of which the Gospels tell. It is just possible that this was a figure of speech, which practically meant no more than the necessaries of life should somehow be provided, directly or indirectly, by God. Nor is this view effectually negatived, as Bahr contends, by Luke 4:26; but, in view of 2 Kings 4:44, Matthew 14:15-21; 2 Kings 15:32-38, it is extremely improbable. It is curious how many miracles of Elijah and Elisha foreshadowed those of our blessed Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah [the echo of ver. 13, \"Go and do according to thy saying\"]: and she, and he, [or he and she, according to Chethib] and her house [probably her friends or poor relatives who came to partake of her plenty (Bahr)], did eat many days. [Heb. days, i.e., an indefinite period. See note on ver. 7.

[Having received a prophet in the name of a prophet, she received a prophet's reward. (Matthew 10:41, 42).

[Does this mean that he was dead? Keil thinks it perfectly clear that it does. Bahr is as firmly persuaded that it does not. He justly remarksNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the same expression occurs in Daniel 10:17 (cf. 1 Kings 10:5) where it does not imply death.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That as the text does not say, \"and he died,\" we must conclude that it did not mean to say it.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Verses 18, 20 do not necessitate the belief that he was dead (see below).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Josephus, who was not afraid of the miraculous, has interpreted the words thus: ὡς καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ἀφεῖναι καὶ δόξαι νεκρον. To this it may be added that נְשָׁמָה simply means breath, and that where it is desired to convey the idea of rife, additional words are used (as in Genesis 2:7, \"the breath of life; Genesis 7:22, \"the breath of the spirit of life.\" Cf. Job 27:3, Proverbs 20:27 (where the intelligence or reason appears to be meant), Ecclesiastes 3:21. It must be confessed also that the statement, \"his sickness was so sore,\" etc., is quite apropos and intelligible, if we may understand that he lay in a state of coma, but would be an extremely roundabout way of affirming that he was dead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee [Heb. what to me and thee.

And he took him out Of her bosom, [the age of the child may hence be roughly inferred] and carried him up into a loft [Heb. הָעֲלִיָּה the upper chamber. LXX. τὸ ὑπερῷον. Loft is most misleading. The upper room, was often [rather, always] the best apartment in an Eastern house\" (Rawlinson). It was sometimes the guest chamber (Luke 22:11, 12), and, from the uses to which it was put, must have been large (Acts 1:13; Acts 9:39; Acts 20:8; 2 Kings 1:2). Thomson (L. & B. 1:235) infers from the fact that the widow's house had an upper room, \"that the mode of building in Elijah's time and the custom of giving the alliyeh to the guest were the same as now; also that this poor widow was not originally among the poorest classes (who bare no alliyeh), but that her extreme destitution was owing to the famine\"], and laid him upon his own bed.

The commentators are again at variance as to whether these words imply the use of natural means or not. Those who hold that the child was dead naturally adopt the negative, and some (Keil, Rawlinson, al.) compare with it the action of our Lord in the case of the blind, deaf and dumb (Matthew 9:35; Luke 7:14; John 9:6, 7). But surely the circumstances and the purpose alike, in these latter cases, were entirely different. The object of the touch, of anointing the eyes, etc., in these cases of healing, appears to have been to awaken a sufficient faith - without which \"He could do no miracle\" (Matthew 13:58) - in men whose infirmities of blindness, deafness, etc., prevented their attaining faith through the ordinary channels of seeing and hearing the merciful and gracious Son of man. But here the child, if not dead, was senseless. We are driven, therefore, to the belief that the prophet \"used rational means for warming and revivifying\" the child, \"not with the hope that of themselves they would prove effectual, but in the sure confidence that God, in answer to his weeping supplication, would impart supernatural force to the natural human agencies,\" Bahr] three times [Not only in his prayer but also in this triple repetition do we recognize Elijah's profound conviction that only by the Almighty power of God could the child be restored, and that whatever means were used, God alone could make them effectual. For three is the number and signature of the Godheads\" die eigentlieh gottliche Zahl, die Signatur des gottlichen Wesens\" (Bahr, Symb. 1:143). Hence it is, inter alia, that \"the calling upon the name of Jehovah in the old covenant\" - he might have added, \"and in the new;\" cf. Mark 14:39, 41; 2 Corinthians 12:8 - \"was a threefold act:\" Psalm 55:17; Daniel 6:10, 13; Numbers 6:24-26; Isaiah 6:3 (Bahr). The correspondence with 2 Corinthians 12:8 is very striking] and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray Thee [Heb. now] let this child's soul come into him [Heb. upon his inside עַל is here, as elsewhere, used for אֵל again. [Though נֶפֶשׁ, here translated \"soul,\" constantly means \"life,\" yet it by no means settles the question whether the child was really living or dead. For,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the, primary meaning of the word is breath (Gesen., Thesaurus, s.v.), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the words might with perfect propriety, even if we interpret \"life\" or \"soul,\" be used of one who lay in a lifeless and inanimate condition. Massillon's graphic language (vol. 1. p. 91, ed. 1858), showing the contrast between Elijah's procedure and that of our blessed Lord (Luke 7:14; Luke 8:54; John 11:43), is worth citing here: \"Elie ressuscite des morts, il est vrai; mais il est oblige de se coucher plusieurs fois sur le corps de l'enfant qu'il ressuscite; il souffle, il se retrecit, it s'agite; on voit bien qu'il invoque une puissance etrangere; qu'il rappelle de l'empire de ta mort une ame qui n'est pas soumise a savoix, et qu'il n'est pas lui-meme le maitre de la mort et de la vie: Jesus-Christ ressuscite les morts comme il fait les actions les plus communes; il parle en maitre a ceux qui dorment d'un sommeil eternel, et l'on sent bien qu'il est le Dieu des morts comme des vivants, jamais plus tranquille que lorsqu'il opere les plus grandes choses.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings17:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived [or recovered.

But it is almost fatal to this view that the duration of the drought is distinctly stated in the New Testament to have been \"three years and six months\" (Luke 4:25; James 5:17). It is every way better, therefore, to connect the words with 1 Kings 17:7, i.e., with the date of the sojourn at Zarephath.

We see here, consequently, an additional reason for his flight (cf. 1 Kings 19:2). These \"prophets\" are the same as those elsewhere called the \"sons of the prophets, i.e., members of the prophetic schools; cf. 2 Kings 2:3, 5, 7, etc.] that Obadiah took an hundred prophets [This would lead us to suppose that the great majority escaped.

The oath corresponds well with the prophet's name], there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee [Keil says the hyperbole is to be explained by the \"inward excitement and fear\" of the speaker. But the Orientals use similar exaggerations in their calmest moments. All that is meant is that all neighbouring and accessible courts had been communicated with. This search for Elijah shows that Ahab regarded him as the author of the drought, and did not recognize it as sent by God. The belief in occult and magical powers has always held possession of the Eastern mind]: and when they said, He is not there [Heb. Not, and he, etc.]; he took an oath [LXX. ἐνέπρησε, which has been thought by some to point to acts of vengeance. But more probably it is a clerical error, perhaps for ὥρκισε, or ἐνώρκισε.

I shall go from thee, and] the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not [These words, which literally translated are \"shall lift thee up upon where,\" etc., are to be explained by 2 Kings 2:16, \"lest the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up\" (same word) \"and cast him upon some mountain,\" etc. Seb. Schmidt, Wordsworth, al. think that such a transportation must have already occurred in the history of Elijah, but the sudden, mysterious disappearance and the long concealment of the prophet is quite sufficient to account for Obadiah's fear. Compare Acts 8:39. The words do suggest, however, that it had been believed by some that the Lord had hid Elijah, and it is not improbable that during his long absence rumours had often gained credence that he had been seen and had suddenly disappeared, just as later Jews have held that he \"has appeared again and again as an Arabian merchant to wise and good Rabbis at their prayers or in their journeys\" (Stanley)]; and so when I come and tell [Heb. and I come to tell] Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me [This is just what a prince like Ahab, or any prince who was under the guidance of a Jezebel, would do, out of sheer vexation at losing his prey when so nearly in his grasp]: but [Heb. and] I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth. [Obadiah's meaning clearly is not that he, \"as a God-fearing man and a protector of the prophets, cannot have any special favour to expect from Ahab\" (Keil; similarly Ewald), but that it was hard that one who was a steadfast worshipper of Elijah's God should be slain for his sake. It is extremely unlikely that Ahab knew of Obadiah's having protected the prophets. He could hardly have maintained him in his post had he known that the steward of the palace had thwarted the designs of his queen.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWas it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord how I hid an hundred men of [Heb. from] the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?

The repetition is suggestive as exhibiting the habit of the man. He was the ready and patient slave of Jehovah. The צְבָאותis apparently introduced not so much to \"elevate the solemnity of the oath\" (Keil, Bahr) - for surely Elijah would wish to make the affirmation of 1 Kings 17:1 as strong and solemn as possible - nor yet to convey the meaning that \"it is not Baal or Ashtaroth who are the rulers of the heavenly bodies\" (Wordsworth), for Obadiah knew that perfectly well, but because it was thus better adapted for a believer. In addressing Ahab it suited Elijah's purpose better to give prominence to the idea that Jehovah was \"the God of Israel\"], I win surely show myself unto him today.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went [Very readily, it would seem.

When Rawlinson says that this charge of troubling Israel has \"never been before brought against any one but Achan,\" he apparently forgets the passage last cited. \"My father hath troubled the land.\" Wordsworth paraphrases, \"Art thou the Achan of Israel?\" but it is very doubtful whether this thought was in Ahab's mind.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy fathers house [It has been supposed that Ahab \"hoped to abash the Tishbite, perhaps to have him at his feet suing for pardon\" (Rawlinson). If so, he must have completely misjudged his man. And why the prophet should sue for pardon, when he was so clearly master of the situation, it is difficult to imagine. It is quite as likely that Ahab expected denunciation and defiance such as he now provokes], in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou [The change from plural to singular is instructive. Preceding kings and the people at large had broken God's commandments by the calf-worship, but Ahab alone had introduced the Baal-cultus into the land] hast followed [Heb. goest after] Baalim. [The plural may either refer to the various names and forms under which Baal was worshipped - Baal-Berith, Baal-Zebub, etc. (Bahr, al.) - or more probably to the various images or statues of this god set up in the land (Gesenius). \"This boldness, this high tone, this absence of the slightest indication of alarm, seems to have completely discomfited Ahab, who ventured on no reply,\" etc. (Rawlinson). It is probable that, though he put on a bold front, he was from the first thoroughly cowed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel [i.e., by representation, the heads of the people, elders, etc. Cf. 1 Kings 8:2, 65; 1 Kings 12:16, 18; 1 Kings 16:16, 17] unto Mount Carmel [Heb., as almost always, the Carmel, i.e., the park. Cf. 1 Samuel 25:1-5. It is \"the park of Palestine.\" It is indebted for this name to the luxuriant vegetation - \"the excellency of Carmel\" (Isaiah 35:2) - which clothes its southern slopes (Porter, p. 371; Stanley, S. and P. pp. 352-54, and App. p. 14; Van de Velde, 1. pp. 317, 318). It is now generally called Mar (i.e., Lord or Saint) Elyas, after the great prophet. No one who has seen the locality can have any doubts as to which part of the mountain was the scene of the sacrifice, or can fail to be struck with the singular fitness of the place to be the theatre of this thrilling history. Carmel is rather a ridge than a mountain, some twelve miles in length. Its western (or strictly N.N.W.) extremity is a bold headland, some 600 feet in height, which dips almost directly into the waters of the Mediterranean. Its highest point, 1728 feet above the sea level, is about four miles from its eastern extremity, which, at an elevation of 1600 feet, rises like a wall from the great plain of Esdraelon. It is at this point, there can be no question, we are to place the scene of the burnt sacrifice. The identification has only been effected in comparatively recent days (1852), but it is beyond dispute. Not only does the Arab name which it bears - El Murahkah, \"the Burning,\" or \"Sacrifice\" - afford striking witness to the identity, but the situation and surroundings adapt themselves with such wonderful precision to the requirements of the narrative as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind. ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) it is a sort of natural platform, or pulpit, raised 1000 feet above the adjoining plain, and therefore well calculated to afford a view of the proceedings, or at least of the descent of the Holy Fire, to spectators of all Israel. The flame would probably be seen by Jezebel in her palace at Jezreel. This eminence is visible from Nazareth, some twenty miles away. \"There is not a more conspicuous spot on all Carmel than the abrupt, rocky height of El Murahkah, shooting up so suddenly on the east\" (Van de Velde, 1. pp. 322, 323). \"The summit... commands the last view of the sea behind and the first view of the great plain in front\" (Stanley). In fact, it was in its way just as well adapted for the solemn vindication of the law which took place there as Jebel Sufsafeh was for the giving of the law.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) A sort of plateau near the summit - the table land where the altars were built, etc. - would accommodate a vast number of spectators (ver. 21).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) There is a spring of water close at hand - less than 100 yards distant - and a spring which is said to flow even in the driest seasons, which would supply the water of which we read in vers. 4, 33-35. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 5) says it came from the fountain.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The sea, though not visible from the plateau itself, is seen from a point some 300 feet higher, a detail which accords admirably with the account of vers. 42-44. It may be added that the place is still held sacred by the Druses, and reverenced by \"Jews, Christians, Moslems, and Bedouin as the site of these miracles of Elijah\" (Thomson). The traveller, consequently, cannot doubt for a moment, as he stands on the table-land of El Murahkah and looks across the great plain to Jezreel and the heights of Galilee and Samaria, that he is on the very spot sanctified by the descent of the heavenly fire. It should be added, as explaining the selection of Carmel by Elijah, that its situation is central end convenient; that it is near the sea, from whence the rain clouds would come; that it is easy of access from Jezreel; and that it was not only a holy place from earlier times (cf. 2 Kings 4:23), but also had its altar of Jehovah, an altar, no doubt, in constant use when the people \"sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places,\" but which had in later days fallen into neglect, and was now broken down. It was every way, therefore, a most appropriate locality for the public vindication of the despised and outraged law of God. \"No place could be conceived more fitted by nature to be that wondrous battlefield of truth\" (Tristram in Wordsworth)], and the prophets of Baal [so called not because they were Weissager und Verkunder (Bahr) of the god, nor yet because they were teachers and emissaries of his religion, but because of the prophetic frenzy (ver. 28) into which they worked themselves (Keil)] four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves [Heb. of the Asherah, i.e., of Astarte, not \"grove,\" as 'Rawlinson. See note on 1 Kings 14:15] four hundred [Rawlinson remarks that \"the number 400 seems to have been one especially affected by Ahab.\" He reminds us that we find 400 prophets at the close of his reign (1 Kings 22:6), and also remarks on \"the prevalence of the number 40 in the religious systems of the Jews (Exodus 36:24, 26; Deuteronomy 25:3, etc.) \" But when it is remembered that Baal's prophets were 450, and the prophets of 1 Kings 22:6 were about 400 men, the solitary instance of the 400 prophets of Astarte - who, by the way, were Jezebel's rather than Ahab's ministers - affords but a slender basis for his conclusion], which eat at Jezebel's table. [Heb. eaters of. There is nothing in the Hebrew to imply that they sat with her at the same board; and it is certain that this would be altogether repugnant to Eastern ideas of propriety.

His ready compliance with Elijah's request, notwithstanding the bitter hatred of the man which he had just betrayed, is easily explained. It was not so much that \"he bowed before the spiritual supremacy of the prophet, which impressed him\" (Bahr), as that he hoped, from his reappearance, that he was now about to speak the word (1 Kings 17:1) and give rain upon the earth, and Ahab was willing to take any measures which would conduce with that result. It would take some days to collect the representatives of the tribes.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.

His object was not \"to prove that Ahab and not he had troubled Israel,\" but to prove that Jehovah and not Baal was God. There is abundant room on the plateau, or \"wide upland sweep\" (Stanley), above referred to, to accommodate a large concourse of people], and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? [This is a faithful and felicitous rendering. But it must be remembered that \"halt\" is used in the sense of \"limp.\" Vulg. Usquequo claudicatis in duas partes. The same word is used in ver. 26 of the swaying, tottering dance of the Baal prophets.] If the Lord be God [Heb. if Jehovah the God], follow him [Heb. go (i.e., walk straight) after him]: but if Baal, then follow him And the people answered him not a word.

I, I am left alone. Cf. Genesis 32:24; μονώτατος] a prophet of the Lord [Thenius hence concludes that the \"hundred prophets\" of whom we read in vers. 4, 13 had been discovered in their hiding place and had been put to death. But this by no means follows from Elijah's statement here or in ch. 19:10 (where see note); and we know that the schools of the prophets had not ceased to exist (2 Kings 2:3, 5, 7; cf. 1 Kings 22:8). All that Elijah says is that he stood that day alone as a prophet of Jehovah. \"I only remain in the exercise of the office of a prophet\" (Rawlinson). The rest might well hesitate, after me fierce persecution which they had undergone, to face the king and their bitter enemies, the Baal prophets. It must be remembered that Elijah had had no opportunity of communicating with them, and he may have been quite ignorant as to what number had remained steadfast and true. One thing he knew, that he alone was left to prophesy, and to confront the whole hierarchy of the false God]; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. [It is clear, not only from the silence of this verse and of ver. 25, respecting them, but still more from the fact that they escaped in the general slaughter (ver. 40), that the prophets of Astarte were not present, and the natural inference is that either Jezebel had forbidden their presence or that they shrank from the ordeal. The LXX. inserts \"and the prophets of the grove, four hundred,\" but the words are evidently added from ver. 19. The Baal prophets would doubtless have been only too glad to do the same, but they were under the immediate command of the king. It is not certain that they had any forebodings of evil, or dreaded reprisals on Elijah's part, but they had had proof conclusive of his power and of their impo-fence. We must remember that all through the triennium prayers and sacrifices had, no doubt, been constantly offered with a view to procure rain. We learn from Menander (Jos., 8:13. 2) that even in Phoenicia supplication had been made for rain by Ethabaal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces [same word Exodus 29:17; Leviticus 1:6, 12; Judges 20:6], and lay it on wood [Heb. the woods], and put no fire under [Heb. and fire they shall not set to]: and I win dress [Heb. make, עָשָׂה, like ποιε1FC0;ιν in the LXX., is constantly used in a sacrificial sense = offer.

He sorrowfully assumes that they have taken Baal and Astarte for their gods], and I will call on the name of the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. [Heb. he shall be the God, i.e., the true God and their God. Cf. ver. 39. Not only was a \"sign from heaven\" (Mark 8:11) ever esteemed a more powerful and direct proof of Divine energy - perhaps as being less liable to be counterfeited, and as excluding the idea of the operation of infernal powers (Matthew 12:24) - but it must be remembered that Baal claimed to be the Sun god and Lord of the elements and forces of nature; while Jehovah bad already, according to the law, identified Himself with this token (Leviticus 9:24; 1 Chronicles 21:26; 2 Chronicles 7:1). Indeed, this sign had a double fit. ness as a test of the true religion. It would not only put the powers of the rival deities to the proof; it would also at the same time decide which of the rival systems of worship was acceptable to the Supreme Being. It is observable that there is no mention of rain. We might have expected, after the long drought, that this would be the test. But that could not be promised until the Lord had first been recognized as God.] And all the people answered and said, Is well spoken. [Heb. Good the word. They accepted Elijah's proposition, but whether eagerly or reluctantly it is difficult to say. The Hebrew merely conveys that they admitted its fairness and reasonableness. Having gained the assent of the people, for whose verdict he and the Baal prophets were now contending, and who were, consequently, entitled to be consulted as to the sign which would satisfy them, he turns to the band of 400 prophets, who, probably in all the bravery of their sacrificial vestments (2 Kings 10:22), occupied a separate position on the hill top, between the king and the people, and repeats his proposal to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress [or offer, as in ver. 23] it first; for ye are many [Heb. the many.

But no doubt he was only too glad to find a reason for their taking the lead. \"He is anxious that their inability shall be fully manifested before he shows his own power\" (Rawlinson). Whether the idea was also present in his mind that they \"could prepare their victim in a much shorter time than he could prepare his\" (ib.) is by no means so certain]; and call on the name of your gods [or god, i.e., Baal], but put no fire under.

Their service as a whole, seeing they were prophets, would be called a \"prophesying,\" and the word, consequently, may merely mean \"they pursued their calling,\" \"they cried and prayed,\" etc.] until the time of the offering [Keil and Rawlinson would translate, \"until towards the time,\" etc. There is certainly some indefiniteness in the words עַד לַעֲלות, until [the hour] for placing, etc., but we may well believe that their dances and cries continued up to the moment of Elijah's prayer (ver. 36)] of the evening sacrifice [Heb. the Minchah, i.e., the meat offering or unbloody sacrifice. In Genesis 4:3-6 the word would appear to be used of any offering; but at a later day it was restricted to bloodless offerings, and was opposed to זֶבַח Cf. Psalm 40:7; Jeremiah 17:26. Directions as to the offering of the Minchah are given, Exodus 29:38-41; Numbers 28:3-8. The evening sacrifice was probably offered then, as it certainly was at a later day, at the ninth hour. Cf. Acts 3:1; Acts 10:3, 30, and see Jos., Ant. 14:04.3. Wordsworth think, this synchronism very significant, as suggesting that the true worship of God was that of the temple in Jerusalem], that there was neither voice, nor any to answer [as in ver. 26], nor any that regarded. [Heb. and not attention. The LXX has a curious variation and addition here: \"And Elijah the Tishbite said to the prophets of the idols, Stand back; I will now make ready my offering.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me.

They have had their opportunity; his turn is come], Come near unto me. [Hitherto they had gathered round the altar of Baal, and some, it may he, had joined their prayers to those of the priests (ver. 24). In ver. 21, he \"drew near\" - same word - to them. Now they must stand round the altar he is about to build. He will have \"eyewitnesses and ear-witnesses\" (Keil). There must be no suspicion of imposture.] And all the people came near unto him And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. [It has been already suggested that this altar may have dated from the time when there was no house built unto the name of the Lord. But it is just as likely that it had been restored, if not raised, by some of the \"seven thousand who had not bowed their knees unto Baal,\" or by some of the faithful remaining in Israel after the calf-worship and the hostility between the two kingdoms had made worship at Jerusalem an impossibility. Anyhow we can hardly be mistaken in holding that this was one of the \"altars\" (1 Kings 19:10), thrown down\" by command of Ahab or Jezebel. Elijah's repairing it was an act of profound significance. It showed him as the restorer of the law and the true religion.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And Elijah took twelve stones [This number, too, was full of significance. Not only would it carry back their thoughts to the giving of the law (Exodus 24:4; Exodus 28:21), and to their fathers' entrance into the promised land (Joshua 4:3, 9), but it would remind them of the essential unity of the people, notwithstanding the division of the kingdom. The act was thus a protest against the schism. We cannot hold with Keil, Wordsworth, al. that it was \"a practical declaration on the part of the prophet that the division of the nation into two kingdoms was at variance with the will of God,\" because we are distinctly told that that division was \"from the Lord\" (1 Kings 12:15). But it was certainly a witness against a divided Church, and a reminder of the unity of the race], according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came [Genesis 32:28], saying, Israel shall be thy name. [He thus protests against the exclusive assumption of the name of Israel, and the exception of the southern kingdom from the glorious heritage and calling of Israel, by the ten tribes. But we cannot follow Bahr in the belief that Jacob received \"from Jehovah the name of Israel,\" i.e., the \"soldier of God,\" because he commanded his house to \"put away the strange gods\" (Genesis 35:2, 10 sqq.), or that Elijah would teach that \"only those who did as Jacob did had a claim to his name.\" The great idea is that the people are one, and are the Lord's.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And with the stones [the twelve he had chosen out of the ruins. Cf. Exodus 20:25] he built an altar in the name of the Lord [not \"by the command of Jehovah\" (Bahr), but rather as the minister and for the service of Jehovah, or, as Keil. \"by the authority and for the glory of Jehovah.\" Nor is it certain that \"he called, as he Built it, on the name of Jehovah, and so dedicated it to His service\" (Rawl.) See Genesis 12:8; Genesis 13:4; Genesis 33:20; Genesis 35:7]: and he made a trench [or channel, 2 Kings 18:17; Isaiah 7:3; Isaiah 36:2; Ezekiel 31:4. The word implies that it was for holding the water, not for keeping off the people] about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed [Heb. as the inside (lit., house) of two seahs of seed. These words have been variously interpreted. Keil, with Thenius and Wordsworth, understands that \"the trench was so large that you could sow two seahs of seed upon the ground which it covered.\" But apart from the fact that בַּיִת must refer to capacity rather than superficial extent, one does not measure a trench, as Bahr observes, by the ground which it covers, but by its depth. He would follow Gesenius in understanding that the trench was so deep as to hold two seahs of seed; i.e., as deep as the grain measure containing two seahs. The סְאָה was the third of an ephah. Cf. Jos., Ant. 9:04. 5, and the σάτα τρία of Matthew 13:33.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood [Rawlinson says \"He obeyed, that is, all the injunctions of the law with respect to the offering of a burnt sacrifice (see Leviticus 1:3-9), and adds, \"He thus publicly taught that all the ordinances of the law were binding on the kingdom of Israel.\" But it is very probable that the priests of Baal had done the same things. All sacrifice involved such manual acts. Cf. Genesis 22:9, where the same word עָרַך is used. No doubt the prophet did everything in an orderly and regular way; but the people could hardly learn a lesson of obedience from such elementary acts as these, and the less so as the law provided, that the sacrifice should be offered only \"by the priests, the sons of Aaron\" (Leviticus 1:8), and Elijah's ministrations, consequently, might seem to warrant or condone the ministrations of Jeroboam's intrusive priesthood. That they did not lend any real sanction to those irregularities is clear, however, to us. For, in the first place, priests were not to be had, all having long since left the kingdom. In the second place, the higher commission of the prophet embraced within itself the authority for all necessary priestly acts. Cf. 1 Samuel 16:2. Elijah acted, as Grotius well observes, jure prophetico, minoribus legibus exsolutus, ut majores servaret], and said, Fill four barrels [Heb. כַּדּים. Cf. 1 Kings 17:12. It designates the ordinary water-pitcher, generally carried then, as now, by women: Genesis 24:14-20; Judges 7:16; Ecclesiastes 12:6] with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. [The water, as already remarked, was doubtless brought from the adjoining spring (though it is clear from ver. 40 that the Kishon was not dry, and Thomson thinks that its sources, and particularly the fountain of Saadieh, furnished the supply). \"In such springs the water remains always cool, under the shade of a vaulted roof, and with no hot atmosphere to evaporate it. While all other fountains were dried up, I can well understand that there might have been found here that superabundance of water which Elijah poured so profusely over the altar\" (Van de Velde, 1. p. 325).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Do it the second time.

And the water ran round [Heb. the waters went round] about the altar, and he filled the trench also [i.e., the trench, which was only partially filled with the water of the twelve כַּדִּים, he now filled to the brim] with water. [The object of these repeated drenchings of the victim and altar was to exclude all suspicion of fraud. It would almost seem as if tricks not unlike that practised year by year at the Greek Easter at Jerusalem were familiar to that age. Some of the fathers expressly state that the idolatrous priests of an earlier time were accustomed to set fire to the sacrifice from hollow places concealed beneath the altar, and it was an old tradition (found in Ephrem Syrus, and Chrysostom) that the Baal prophets had concealed a man for that purpose beneath their altar, but that he had died from suffocation (Stanley). Bahr, however, sees in these 3 x 4 vessels of water a symbolical act. The significance of this combination, he says, is unmistakable (cf. \"Symbolik\" 1. pp. 150, 169, 193, 205), though we cannot be certain as to the precise meaning of the prophetic act. His only suggestion is that it points to abundance of rain as the reward of keeping the covenant (Deuteronomy 28:12, 23). But all this is extremely precarious, and the more so as the pitchers may have been filled any number of times before the trench was full.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice [see note on ver. 29], that Elijah the prophet [this designation of Elijah is unusual. Cf. Malachi 4:5. Elsewhere he is \"the Tishbite,\" or the \"man of God\"] came near, and said, Lord [Heb. Jehovah. Not only does the sacred name stand at the head of his prayer, it is also mentioned thrice (LXX. four times)] God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel [Two things are to be noticed here: first, that this formula had only once before been used, and that by God Himself, before the giving of law, at the burning bush. It was when God revealed Himself in flaming fire that He had proclaimed Himself the God of Abraham, etc. Secondly, that the variation \"Israel\" is made designedly (cf. ver. 31), not only to proclaim the Lord as the \"God of Israel\" (cf. 1 Kings 17:1), but also to suggest that the name and privileges of Israel belonged to all the sons of Jacob. The LXX. adds, \"Hear me, O Lord, hear me this day by fire\" - most of which is clearly borrowed from the next verse], let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel [according to ver. 24, \"the God that answereth by fire, etc.], and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things according to thy word.

[Cf. Malachi 4:5, 6: \"He \"Elijah the prophet\") shall turn the heart of the fathers,\" etc. He speaks as if the miracle were already wrought (cf. John 11:41), and the people already repentant.

Similarly Rawlinson. But it is very doubtful whether עָפָר pulvis, could be used in this sense. It may mean dry earth, but this altar had been deluged with water], and licked up [לָחַך is clearly onomatopoetic, like our lick; Germ. lecken; Gr. λείχω, etc. It expresses well the action of tongues of flame] the water that was in the trench.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces [As in Leviticus 9:24; 2 Chronicles 7:3; cf.

The connexion of this verse with the three verses preceding is obscured by our translation], he is the God; the Lord, he is the God. [The echo of ver. 24. The Hebrew words are the same. Stanley remarks that it is as if (by a slight inversion) they turned \"the name of the prophet himself into a war-cry, 'Eli-Jah-hu.'\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. [Elijah's promptitude is extremely striking. The people had hardly recovered from their terror and awe before he proceeds to judgment. The narrative has the air of truth, and was doubtless reduced to writing by an eye-witness.] And they took them: and Elijah brought them down [Heb. caused them to go down, i.e., had them brought down. He could but lead the way, as they numbered 450] to the brook [Wady. \"Like most of the so called ' rivers of Palestine,' the perennial stream forms but a small part of the Kishon\" (Grove)] Kishon [\"Tortuous,\" now called Nahr el Mukatta, the \"river of slaughter.\" See Thomson, L. and B. 2. pp. 140, 141; Porter, pp. 383-4; Dict. Bib. 2. p. 45. It flows directly under Carmel], and slew them there. [Obviously, he merely superintended the slaughter. That he slew them all with his own hand is altogether out of the question. Nor is it clear that\" sword in hand he stood over them\" (Stanley). Josephus rightly explains: \"they slew the prophets at Elijah's instigation.\" It is almost certain, from their resorting to the Kishon for this purpose, that it was not quite dry at the time. Their blood would mingle with its waters, and the flood which the \"great rain\" would presently produce (cf. Judges 5:21) would carry their corpses down to the sea. It has often been supposed that the mound near the Kishon, known as Tell el Cassis, \"the mound of the priests,\" derives its name from this slaughter of the prophets of Baal. But Conder (p. 90) remarks that \"Kassis is the word applied to a Christian priest, and the word Kohen or Kamir would more naturally be expected if there was any real connexion with the idolatrous priests of Baal.\"] This action of the prophet Elijah in instituting this wholesale slaughter in the hour of his triumph has been repeatedly arraigned and denounced, but most unjustly. According to some, it was an act of gross fanaticism and cruelty; others have seen it in a wild and terrible vendetta for the murder of the Lord's prophets. By some, indeed, it has been justified on the principles of the lex talionis (Exodus 21:24, etc.); on the ground, that is to say, that the men who had instigated Jezebel in her attempted extermination of the prophetic schools had merited extermination in their turn. But it is a fatal objection to their view, first, that we not only have no proof, but no reason for thinking, that it was at their instigation that the queen \"cut off the prophets of the Lord;\" and, secondly, that it is not clear that she succeeded in her sanguinary purpose, or that many lives were sacrificed to her fury. And Elljah's action needs no such lame apologies. As the Lord's prophet, as the vindicator and restorer of the law, there was no other course open to him. If the Mosaic law was then written, and this very incident is one of the proofs that it was then written; if, however it had fallen into contempt or desuetude, it was still binding upon Israel; and if Elijah was justified in executing its provisions, and was required to execute them, however repugnant they might be to his inclinations (Deuteronomy 27:26; Galatians 3:10), then he could not have done otherwise than he did. For it was an essential part of that law, it was an obligation that was laid, not once or twice, but on three separate occasions (Exodus 22:20; Deuteronomy 13; Deuteronomy 17:2-7), on the Jewish people, it was a duty they were to perform, however distressing and harrowing it might be (Deuteronomy 13:6-9), to provide that the worshipper of false gods, and especially the teacher of such worship, should be put to death. It was primarily, of course, the duty of the authorities, of the theocratic king and his subordinates, to execute these injunctions. But the king of that age was corrupt and powerless - nay, was himself idolatrous. So great was the depravity of the time that the false prophet enjoyed the favour and protection of the court, and the true prophet was everywhere being hunted to death. The execution of this law, consequently, could not be expected from the king. It must be executed, if at all, in spite of him, and in disregard of his protests. It was only Elijah, therefore, could put it into force, and Elijah only in the hour of his triumph. And the jus zelotyparum, the right claimed by every faithful Jew to execute vengeance, after the example of Phinehas (Numbers 25:11), upon any gross breach of the Divine law committed in his presence, was not his only warranty; he held a commission, higher than the king's, as the prophet of the Most High. He had just proved that the Lord He was God. It was now for him to prove that God's law was no dead letter. It was for him to cut off the men - some of them renegades from the faith of Israel, some of them foreign emissaries introduced into the land who had corrupted his countrymen, and threatened the very existence of the true religion. It is necessary, therefore, for those who challenge his conduct in this respect, who call him sanguinary, vindictive, etc., to settle their account with the law which he obeyed, and, indeed, with Him who has approved this deed, and has forewarned us that He too will act in like manner (Luke 19:27). For this terrible retribution is by no means an exceptional or isolated act, in contrast to the general spirit of that dispensation; on the contrary, it is in thorough accord with the system out of which it sprung. We gain nothing, therefore, by repudiating this one transaction. For clearly, in the first place, it was allowed and approved of God, who otherwise would hardly have answered the prayer which Elijah presently offered, and (2) other similar acts have distinctly received Divine commendation (Exodus 32:25-28; Numbers 25:7-13; 2 Kings 1:9 sqq.) It is true that the spirit of Elias was not the spirit of Christianity (Luke 9:56), but it is forgotten how different was the dispensation of Elijah from that of the New Covenant. In that age idolaters must receive their just recompense of reward, because the judgment to come had not then been revealed; because justice must be measured out to men in this life. We do not avenge idolatry or irreligion now with fire and sword, not because the thing is any the less sinful, but because the duty has been taken out of our hands; because our religion instructs us to leave it to Him who has said, \"Vengeance is Mine,\" etc. It is perhaps worth remarking here that there is nothing in this history half so dreadful as might be seen on a thousand battlefields - and those not battlefields for truth and right - on which, nevertheless, Elijah's critics have learned to look with complacency. It may, however, be objected to this view that the punishment denounced by the law was stoning (Deuteronomy 13:10; Deuteronomy 17:5). But surely it is easy to see why, in this particular, the law was not kept. It was simply that the exigency of the occasion did not permit of its being kept. It was because the 450 traitors to God and their country could not be stoned within the few hours that remained before the night closed in and the multitude dispersed, that a more speedy punishment, that of the sword, was adopted. And it would have been a sacrifice of the spirit of the law to the letter had some few false prophets been stoned and the rest thereby been afforded the opportunity to escape, and, under Jezebel's protection, to renew their efforts against truth and morality and religion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up [It is clear from the word עֲלֵה that the king had gone down with the crowd to the Kishon. Curiosity had perhaps impelled him to witness the slaughter which he was powerless to prevent. And no doubt he had been profoundly awed by the portent he had just witnessed], eat and drink [It is hardly likely that there was aught of derision in these words. It is extremely probable that the excitement of the ordeal was so intense that the king had barely tasted food all day long. Elijah now bids him eat if he can, after what he has witnessed. There is now, he suggests, no further cause for anxiety or alarm. The people being repentant (vers. 39, 40), and the men who have brought a curse on the land being cut off, the drought can now be abated (cf. 2 Samuel 21:1, 6, 14). The next words assign the reason why he should eat and drink. It is a mistake, however (Ewald, Rawlinson), to suppose that he was bidden to \"eat of the feast which always followed a sacrifice,\" for this was a whole burnt offering and had been entirely consumed (ver. 38). It is probable that the attendants of the king had spread a tent for him upon the plateau, and had brought food for the day along with them]; for there is a sound of abundance of rain [Heb. for a voice of a noise - הָמון; cf. hum, an onomatopoetic word - of rain. Gesenius and Keil think that the prophet could already hear the sound of the drops of rain, but if so, it was only in spirit (cf. ver. 45). The words may refer to the rise of the wind which so often precedes a storm, but it is more probable that Elijah speaks of signs and intimations understood only by himself. This was the \"word\" of 1 Kings 17:1.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Ahab went up to eat and to drink.

And Elijah went up to the top [Heb. head] of Carmel [It is clear from Ver. 43 that this was not the actual summit, nor can it have been, as Bahr supposes, the outermost promontory towards the sea, unless he means the foot or slope of that ridge or promontory, for from this רֹאשׁ the sea was not visible. It also appears from the עֲלֵה of ver. 44 that this point must have been at a lower elevation than the plateau where the altar had stood and where Ahab's tent was]; and he cast himself down upon the earth [Same word 2 Kings 4:34, 35, of Elisha's prostration upon the dead child. But if Elijah \"stretched himself full length\" upon the earth, as the Easterns constantly do in prayer (see Thomson, 1:26, 27) it was but for a moment, as we presently find him kneeling], and put his face between his knees.

It is an old tradition that this was none other than the son of the Sareptan, who was afterwards known as the prophet Jonah (Jerome, Praef. in Jonam). See note on 1 Kings 17:24], Go up now, look toward [Heb. the way of] the sea. [It is a striking confirmation of the theory which identifies El Murahkah with the scene of Elijah's sacrifice that the sea, though not visible from the plateau itself, is from the crest of the hill, a few feet higher. Van de Velde writes, \"On its west and northwest sides the view of the sea is quite intercepted by an adjacent height. That height may be ascended, however, in a few minutes and a full view of the sea obtained from the top.\" Similarly the latest authority, Mr. Condor: \"The peak is a semi-isolated knoll with a cliff some forty feet high, looking southeast .... The sea is invisible, except from the summit, and thus it was only by climbing to the top of Carmel, from the plateau where the altar may have stood, that the prophet's servant could have seen the little cloud,\" etc.] And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. [Cf. Joshua 6:15-20; 2 Kings 5:14; Matthew 18:21; Psalm 119:164. The idea here is that of sufficiency, of completion, rather than, as elsewhere, of covenant. And yet it must be remembered that Elijah was only praying for what God had already promised to grant (ver. 1). This earnest prayer for rain under these circumstances suggests that the former prayer \"that it might not rain\" (James 5:17) had also been inspired of God. But it is worth considering whether Elijah's attitude was not one of reverent and assured expectation, as much as of prayer. When Rawlinson says that \"the faithfulness and patience shown [by the servant] in executing this order without a murmur, imply devotedness of no common kind,\" he surely forgets that the drought had lasted for three years and a half, and that the servant had that day seen the fires of God descend at Elijah's prayer. It is inconceivable, under such circumstances, that any man could murmur.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.

But it is not in Palestine alone that a little cloud on the horizon is frequently the harbinger of rain]. And he said, Go up [see note on ver. 42], say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot [Heb. bind], and get thee down [Keil, Stanley, and others assume that Ahab's chariot was waiting at the foot of the mountain. But it is to be noticed that the command to harness the horses precedes that to \"go down.\" The writer rode down from El Murahkah to the plain, and it is quite conceivable that the royal chariot may have conveyed Ahab to the plateau of sacrifice and have waited for him there], that the rain stop thee not, [After heavy rain (גֶּשֶׁם) the Kishon, which \"collects the whole drainage of this large basin\" (Conder), the Great Plain, soon becomes an impassable swamp.(Judges 5:21), \"I can tell you from experience that in wet seasons it (the Wady) is extremely muddy, and then the Kishon causes great tribulation to the muleteers.

The practical difference is not great], that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. [\"The cry of the boy from his mountain watch had hardly been uttered when the storm broke upon the plain\" (Stanley). \"The storm\" [over \"the dark slate-coloured ridge of Carmel,\" witnessed by Conder in 1872] \"burst suddenly, the rain descending with violence, hissing on the ground, as if not able to come down fast enough, and accompanied with gusts of wind, thunder, and lightning.\"] And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings18:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah [Same expression 2 Kings 3:15; Ezekiel 1:3; Ezekiel 3:14; Ezekiel 8:1; Ezekiel 33:22; cf. also Exodus 9:3; Judges 2:15; Ruth 1:13; Acts 11:21; Acts 13:11. Some of the commentators understand the words of Divine guidance, some of a supernatural strengthening. There is no need to exclude either interpretation. An impulse from on high impelled him to \"gird up his loins\" and go with the king; a strength not his own sustained him whilst \"he ran,\" etc. The distance across the plain to Jezreel is about fourteen miles; the royal chariot would drive furiously, and whatever fleetness and endurance the prophet had acquired in the wilds of Gilead, it seems hardly likely that, after the fatigues and excitement of that day, he would have been able, without the hand of the Lord upon him, to keep ahead of the chariot horses], and he girded up his loins [i.e., gathered round his waist the abba, or \"mantle\" - the אַדֶּרֶת (cf. 1 Kings 19:13, 19; 2 Kings 2:13, 14) was so-called from its ample size - which would otherwise have impeded his movements. Probably this, apart from the girdle, was his sole garment. (See Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 232)], and ran before Ahab [Thomson (vol. 2. p. 227) mentions an interesting illustration of this incident which he witnessed. The forerunners of Mohammed All Pasha \"kept just ahead of the horses, no matter how furiously they were ridden, and in order to run with the greatest ease they not only girded their loins very tightly, but also tucked up their loose garments under the girdle.\" But such a spectacle is of common occurrence in the East. Kitto remarks that the Shatirs of Persia keep pace with ease with their masters' horses. They also are tightly girded. His object was apparently twofold. First, to honour the sovereign whom he had that day humbled in the presence of his subjects. The great prophet, by assuming the lowly office of a footman, or forernnner (see note on 1 Kings 1:5), would give due reverence to the Lord's anointed, like Samuel on a somewhat similar occasion (1 Samuel 15:30, 31). Secondly, he may have hoped by his presence near the king and court to strengthen any good resolves which the former might have made, and to further the work of reformation which he could not but hope the proceedings of that day would inaugurate. That this tribute of respect would be grateful to Ahab, who hitherto had only regarded Elijah as an adversary, it is impossible to doubt. And that Elijah believed he had struck a death blow to the foreign superstitions fostered by the court, and especially by the queen, is equally certain. It is not clear, as Bahr assumes, that his servant accompanied him on the road. He may have rejoined him later on in the day or night] to the entrance [Heb. until thou comest to. The Arab aversion, which Elijah is supposed to have shared, to entering cities, has often been remarked. But there were other and deeper reasons why he should not adventure himself within the city. Probably the same guiding hand which led him to Jezreel impelled him to lodge outside the walls. It was impossible to say what Jezebel, in her transports of rage, might do. After such a day, too, any prophet would shrink from familiar contact with men and from the strife of tongues] of Jezreel. [Ahab had a palace here (1 Kings 21:1). But Samaria was still the capital, and so remained till the captivity (1 Kings 22:37; 2 Kings 15:13, 14; 2 Kings 17:5, 6). The selection of Jezreel as a royal residence is easily accounted for. It stands on \"a knoll 500 feet high\" (Conder), overlooking both the plain of Esdraelon and the valley of Jezreel. In fact, it is the finest situation in the \"Great Plain.\" Hence perhaps its name \"the sowing place of God.\" See Stanley, S. and P. pp. 336 sqq.; Porter, p. 353; Dict.

There, in the darkness, the messenger found him, Bahr assumes that this message had Ahab's sanction; i.e., that he must have known of it and was too weak to prevent it. But it is just as likely that it was sent without his privity. On the evening of that day he would be afraid to threaten one vested with such tremendous powers as Elijah had just proved himself to possess], saying [Here the LXX. inserts \"If thou art Eliou and I Jezebel\"], So let gods [As ךאלֹהִים is here found with a the plural verb, it is rightly assumed that the reference is to the divinities of Phoenicia or of paganism generally. Besides, Jezebel would hardly swear by the one God of Elijah and of Israel. The LXX., however, has ὁ θεὸς], do to me, and more also [Heb. and so let them add. See on 1 Kings 2:23. Stanley appositely recalls to our minds \"the tremendous vows which mark the history of the Semitic race, both within and without the Jewish pale, the vow of Jephthah, the vow of Saul, the vow of Hannibal.\" Rawlinson remarks that this oath was \"familiar in the mouths of kings about this time\" (1 Kings 20:10; 2 Kings 6:31). But it was a standing formula in Israel at all times. See Ruth 1:17; 1 Samuel 3:17; etc.], if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. [\"That queen consort, it seems, was, in effect, queen regent\" (Henry). What induced the queen to send this message? For it is obvious that if she really meant to slay Elijah, she took the very means to defeat her purpose by thus forewarning him of her intentions. Some of the older expositors (see, e.g., Hall, vol. 2. p. 396) have seen in the act a proof of her blind infatuation, of that infatuation which God often employs to defeat the machinations of wicked men, and this view is not to be lightly rejected. That she fully meant what she said is hardly to be doubted. But later writers, including Keil, Bahr, and Wordsworth, see in the threat nothing more than a scheme for ridding herself of the presence of Elijah. They argue that, finding herself unable to put him to death, partly because of the impression he had made upon the people, and partly, too, because of the ascendancy he had just gained over the king, she resolved, by threatening him with instant death, to give him an opportunity for flight. But this view hardly takes sufficiently into account the exasperation, the blind unreasoning hate, or the reckless and desperate character of the queen. It must be remembered that this message was despatched, not after she had had time for thought and calculation, but on the spur of the moment, as soon as she had heard of the massacre of the priests of Baal. That night she could do nothing, nor perhaps could she see her way clearly to compass his death on the morrow. But she will have him know that he is not going to escape her, and that, whatever the effect on her husband, she is unconquered and unrelenting. She does not stop to argue that he may take the alarm and flee. But she must gratify her impotent rage forthwith by threatening him with death the next day.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And when he saw that [Heb. and he saw and arose, etc. But the LXX. has καὶ ἐφοβήθη, and the Vulgate timuit, and it is to be observed that this meaning, \"and he feared,\" can be extracted from this word וירא without any change of radicals, for the full form יִירָא is occasionally abbreviated into יִרָא; see 1 Samuel 18:12; 1 Samuel 21:13; 2 Kings 17:28. A few MSS. have here וייּרא and it certainly suits the context better. Bahr, who interprets, \"he saw how matters stood,\" i.e., that she meant him to flee, is not justified in asserting that this expression would require an accusative of the person feared. (See, e.g., Genesis 3:10; Genesis 15:1; Genesis 18:15.) Both he and Keil furthermore object to this interpretation that it is contrary to actual fact, neither of them being willing to allow that Elijah was afraid. Bahr says it is inconceivable that the man who had that day faced alone king and priests and the entire people should have become all at once afraid of a bad woman, and he explains Elijah's flight as caused by the discovery that he could not carryon his work of reformation, and by the absence of any intimation (like that of 1 Kings 18:1) that he was to stay and hazard his life. But apart from the fact that we are distinctly told that he \"went for his life\" (cf. vers. 4, 10), and that his flight seems to have been instant and hurried, history tells of many great souls, hardly less brave than Elijah's, which have succumbed to a sudden panic. Anyhow, it is evident that for the moment Elijah had lost faith in God, otherwise he would certainly have waited for the \"word of the Lord,\" which had hitherto invariably guided his movements (1 Kings 17:2, 8; 1 Kings 18:1). No doubt other emotions besides that of fear were struggling in his breast, and prominent among these was the feeling of profound disappointment and mortification. It is clear that he had hoped that the \"day of Carmel\" would turn the heart of the entire nation back again (1 Kings 18:37), and the great shout of ver. 39, and the subsequent execution, at his command, of the men who had deceived and depraved the people, might well justify the most sanguine expectations. We can readily imagine, consequently, how, especially after the excitement and fatigues of that day, the threatening and defiant message of the queen would seem the death blow of his hopes, and how, utterly dispirited and broken down, he lost all trust, all faith, and, while fleeing for his life, \"requested for himself that he might die\" (ver. 4)], he arose, and went for his life [Keil is compelled, by his refusal to allow that Elijah was actuated by fear, to render these words, \"went to commit his soul to God in the solitude of the desert.\" But the men meaning is settled for us by the like expression in 2 Kings 7:7; nor does Jeremiah 44:7 lend any support to Keil's view. Gesenius compares τρέχειν περὶ ψυχῆς. Od. 9:423. The A.V. exactly represents the meaning], and came to Beer-sheba [Genesis 21:31; Genesis 26:33. The southern boundary of Palestine (Joshua 15:28; 2 Samuel 24:7; Judges 20:1; 1 Chronicles 21:2, etc.), allotted to the tribe of Simeon (Joshua 19:2), which tribe, we gather from this passage (see also 2 Chronicles 19:4), was now absorbed in the southern kingdom. (See note on ch. 11:31.) Wordsworth suggests that \"perhaps he resorted to Beer-sheba in order to strengthen his faith with the recollection of the patriarchs who had dwelt there,\" etc. But if that had been his object, a journey to the place was hardly necessary, and it is clear that he only passed through it on his way to Mount Sinai. \"Beer-sheba was about 95 miles from Jezreel\" - Rawlinson, who adds that Elijah cannot have reached it till the close of the second day. But we must remember that his pace would be regulated by the powers of his servant, probably a mere lad (LXX. παιδάριον), so that it is hardly likely he could travel day and night without stopping to rest], which belongeth to Judah [It is part of Keil's argument in proof that Elijah did not flee from fear of Jezebel, that, had such been the case, he would have remained in the kingdom of Judah, where he would have enjoyed the protection of Jehoshaphat. But it is by no means certain that this prince, considering his close alliance with Ahab (1 Kings 22:4; cf. 18:10; 2 Kings 8:18; 2 Chronicles 18:1), would have sheltered the prophet. Indeed, it is remarkable, as Blunt has well pointed out (Coincid. pp. 183, 184), that the prophet never took refuge in the southern kingdom. At one time he found a sanctuary beyond the Jordan; at another in the kingdom of Tyre, but never in the realm of Jehoshaphat. When he does come in haste to Beer-sheba, \"it is after a manner which bespeaks his reluctance to set foot within that territory, even more than if he had evaded it altogether.\" The reason partly was, no doubt, as Wordsworth says, that his mission was to idolatrous Israel. Judah had both priests and prophets of its own], and left his servant [There is no warrant for the assertion (Stanley) that \"one only of that vast assembly remained faithful to him, the Zidonian boy of Zarephath.\" The identity of this boy with the servant is by no means certain; nor is the defection of the people at all proven] there. [Probably because he wished to be alone with God; possibly because the boy was then too exhausted to go further, and there was no reason why he should be subjected to the uncertainties and privations of desert life; hardly for the security of both (Blunt). It is perhaps implied, however, that the kingdom of Judah, though not a safe abode for him, would be for his servant. When we remember that this servant never rejoined him, but that presently Elisha took his place, we can scarcely help wondering whether he was afraid to accompany Elijah any longer (cf. Acts 15:38).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness [Cf. Genesis 21:14, 21; Jeremiah 9:2; Revelation 12:6. Beer-sheba stands on the fringe of the desert of Et-Tih. It was not for the sake of security alone that the prophet plunged into the \"great and terrible wilderness.\" It is probable that from the first, \"Horeb, the mount of God,\" was in his thoughts. He may well have seen that he was destined to be a second Moses; that he was raised up to assert and enforce the covenant of which Moses was the mediator. We have seen already that he cites the words spoken to Moses at the bush (1 Kings 18:36); that to him as to Moses there was granted an apparition of fire; we now find him rejected as Moses had been before him (Acts 7:25, 35). How natural that, like Moses, he should flee into the land of Midian, to the place where God had spoken With Moses face to face. Wordsworth reminds us that the Jewish Church, by its cycle of lessons, suggests a comparison between the Law Giver and the Law Restorer], and came and sat down under a [Heb. one; see note on 1 Kings 13:11] juniper tree [The רֹתֶם, here found with a feminine numeral (Keri, masculine), in ver. 5 with a masculine, is not the juniper, but the plant now known to the Arabs as retem, i.e., the broom (genista monosperma, or G. raetam), \"the most longed for and most welcome bush of the desert, abundant in beds of streams and valleys, where spots for camping are selected, and men sit clown and sleep in order to be protected against wind and sun\" (Robinson, Pal. vol. 1. p. 203). It does not, however, afford a complete protection (Thomson, L. and B. vol. 2. pp. 436, 437). Every traveller remarks on its abundance in the desert; it gave a name, Rithmah, to one of the stations of the Israelites (Numbers 33:18. Cf. Stanley, S. and P. pp. 20, 79). Its roots are still used by the Bedouin, for the manufacture of charcoal (cf. Psalm 120:4, \"coals of rethern\"), which they carry to Cairo]: and he requested for himself [Heb. asked as to his life, accusative of reference] that he might die [Again like Moses, Numbers 11:15; Exodus 32:32]; and said, It Is enough [or, Let it be enough.

Here the man who was destined not to taste of death, flees from death on the one hand and seeks it on the other.\" Kitto]; for I am not better than my fathers. [These words clearly reveal the great hopes Elijah had formed as to the result of his mission, and the terrible disappointment his banishment had occasioned him. Time was when he had thought himself a most special messenger of Heaven, raised up to effect the regeneration of his country. He now thinks his work is fruitless, and he has nothing to live for longer.

Cf. Genesis 16:9; Genesis 21:17] touched [Heb. touching] him and said unto him, Arise and eat. [Probably he had eaten little or nothing since leaving Jezreel. Food was now what he most needed.

Hence the Vulgate calls it sub-cinericius panis], and a cruse of water at his head [i.e., the place of his head. Marg. bolster. The word is almost used as a preposition.

Exodus 24:18; Exodus 34:28; Deuteronomy 9:9, 25; Jonah 3:4; Matthew 4:2; Acts 1:3. But the primary reference is perhaps to the \"forty days and forty nights\" which Moses spent in Horeb, during which he \"neither did eat bread nor drink water\" (Deuteronomy 9:9), or to the forty years during which Israel was sustained in this same desert with \"angels' food\" (Psalm 78:25). It is noteworthy how both Moses and Elias were precursors of our Lord in a forty days' fast. \"The three great fasters met gloriously on Tabor\" (Hall). It is not implied that it took the prophet the whole of this time to reach Horeb, which is only distant from Beer-sheba some 130 miles. \"There are eleven days' journey from Horeb, by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnes\" (Deuteronomy 1:2). It is of course possible that he wandered aimlessly hither and thither during this period, but it seems better to understand the words of the whole of his desert sojourn] unto Horeb the mount of God. [See note on 1 Kings 8:9. It is just possible that Horeb was already known as \"the mount of God\" at the time God appeared to Moses there - the whole of the Sinaitic peninsula was sacred in the eyes of the Egyptians; but it is more probable that this designation is used in Exodus 3:1 prophetically, and that it was Bestowed on the Mount of the Law because of the special revelation of the Godhead there (Exodus 3:6; Exodus 19:3, 11, 18; Deuteronomy 1:6; Deuteronomy 4:10; Deuteronomy 5:2, etc.)]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And he came thither unto a cave [Heb. the cave. LXX. τὸ σπήλαιον. Many commentators identify this with \"the cliff of the rock\" where Moses was concealed while the Lord \"passed by\" (Exodus 33:22), and the use of the same word, עבֵר in ver. 11 certainly favours this view. But is it clear that the clift (נִקְרָה fissure) was a cave? Ewald understands \"the cave in which at that time travellers to Sinai commonly rested.\" It is perhaps worth remembering that a part of the desert, though at some distance from Horeb; boars at this day the name of Magharah, or cave. But there is a \"narrow fret\" pointed out by tradition as the abode of Elijah, on the side of Jebol Muss. \"There is nothing to confirm, but there is nothing to contradict, the belief that it may have been in that secluded basin, which has long been pointed out as the spot No scene could be more suitable for the vision which follows\" (Stanley). There is, however, one formidable difficulty in the way of this identification, viz., that the cave is only just large enough for a man's body, which does not agree with ver. 18], and lodged [לוּן means strictly to pass the night. It is possibly connected radically with לַיְלָה] there; and, behold, the word of the Lord came to him [Not \"in vision as he slept\" (Rawlinson). He could not \"go forth\" in his sleep. That he was to go forth \"on the morrow\" is equally unlikely see ver. 11, note], and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? [Many writers, Bahr and Keil among them, will not allow that there is aught of reproof in this question, or that Elijah had in any way erred in his hasty flight. The former asks how it comes to pass that the angel, instead of reproving him, succoured and strengthened him (vers. 6, 7), if he was acting in faithlessness or disobedience. But surely it does not follow that God denies all grace and sustenance to His elect servants even if they do, in a moment of despair, forget or distrust Him. Elijah may have been strengthened for this very journey, Because God would meet with him and teach him the lessons of patience and trust he needed to learn, at the \"mount of God\" itself. And his answer, especially when contrasted with that of ver. 14 (where see note), certainly betrays, not only irritation and despair, but a \"carnal zeal which would gladly have called down the vengeance of the Almighty upon all idolaters\" (Keil). The question in itself, it is true, does not necessarily impart censure - it might merely mean, \"What wouldst thou learn of me?\" But when it is remembered that the prophet had been sent to every other destination by the \"word of the Lord,\" and that he had left Jezreel without any such word - left it in terror and bitter disappointment and sheer distrust of God - it does look as if the words conveyed a gentle reminder that he had deserted the post of duty, and had no right to be there.

Numbers 25:11, which the prophet may have had in his mind. But the jealousy of Phinehas was in harmony with that of God (ver. 13)] for the Lord God of hosts [\"The title of Lord God of hosts is first heard in the mouth of Elijah the prophet, who had been very jealous for Jehovah in opposition to Baal and Ashtaroth [Ash-toreth?] the Phoenician deifies; cf. 2 Kings 23:5, 'Baal, the sun, and moon, and planets, and all the host of heaven'\" (Wordsworth)]: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant [he had memories of the covenant all around him], thrown down thine altars [cf. 1 Kings 18:30, note. It is clear that many altars, similar to that on Carmel, had been built, and had been overturned], and slain thy prophets with the sword [If the \"hundred prophets\" of 1 Kings 18:4 escaped, of which we cannot be certain, others did not]; and I, even I only, am left [See note on 1 Kings 18:22. It must be confessed that the prima facie view is that the prophets had been well nigh exterminated. But we must take into account the deep despondency with which Elijah spoke, and remember the correction which his words received (ver. 18)]; they seek my life, to take it away. [The commentators are hopelessly divided as to the spirit and temper with which these words were spoken. Bahr, as before, is very positive that there is no complaint or murmuring against God on Elijah's part. He contends that the prophet has been led to Sinai simply by the earnest longing for a disclosure concerning the dealings of God, and for instructions as to his future conduct; and this view has the support of other weighty authorities. But it is extremely difficult to resist the conclusion that we have here at the least a \"tacit reproof that God had looked on so quietly for such a length of time, and had suffered things to come to such an extremity\" (Keil). St. Paul speaks of him as pleading with God against Israel (ἐντυγχάνει τῷ θεῷ κατὰ τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ. Romans 11:2), said certainly represents the χρηματισμός he received as a connection. And the idea which this verse, taken in connexion with the prophet's flight (ver. 3) and his prayer (ver. 4), leaves on the unbiassed mind certainly is that in his zeal for God he resented not only the growing corruption of the age, but above all the frustration of his efforts to stay it. What burdened and vexed his righteous soul was that in the very hour of victory, when the people had confessed that Jehovah alone was God, he, the one solitary witness for the truth, should be driven from his post to escape as best he might, and to leave the covenant people to the baneful influence of Jezebel and her army of false prophets. It is the cry which we hear over and over again in the Old Testament, the complaint of the silence and apparent indifference of God, of the persecution of the righteous, and the impunity of evil doers.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.

An abiding presence, a שֹׁכֵן, was more than man could bear. So Bahr. As Elijah does not seem to have gone forth from the cave until he heard the still small voice (ver. 13), some would take the participle עבֵר which is probably employed as more graphic, as a future, i.e., \"the Lord will pass by,\" and this is the interpretation of the LXX.; ἰδοὺ παρελεύσιται κύριος καὶ ἰδοὺ πνεῦμα μέγα κ.τ.λ. The effect of this rearrangement of the text would be that the words, \"And behold the Lord passing by,\" must be taken as a part of the message, \"Go forth,\" etc., and not as a statement of what happened. That statement would then begin with the next words, \"And a great and strong wind,\" etc. But in that case we might have expected \"For behold,\" etc., or the \"And behold\" would have come before \"a great and strong wind,\" etc. It is also to be considered - and this seems to me decisive - that the words \"rent,\" \"break,\" etc., are also participles, which it would be unnatural to divorce from the participle preceding], and a great and strong wind [Such as was net uncommon in that region. The approach to Sinai from the west is known as Nukb-Hawy, \"the pass of the winds.\" Elsewhere we find the Wady-el-Burk, or \"valley of lightning.\" These phenomena - the tempest, fire, etc. - would be all the more awful and impressive because of the surrounding desolation and the utter solitude] rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind [Heb. not in the wind Jehovah]: and after the wind an earthquake [Once before (Exodus 19:18) an earthquake accompanied the descent of God upon the same mountain. The desert of Sinai, with the exception of the Hammam Pharoun and other hot springs, affords no traces of volcanic action. \"Everywhere there are signs of the action of water, nowhere of fire\" (Stanley). But רַעַשׁ properly means (compare rauschen, rush) a crashing noise (Job 39:24; Isaiah 9:4), and the mysterious sounds of Jebel Musa have often been remarked (see Stanley, S. and P. pp. 13, 14)]; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And after the earthquake a fire [For the association of tempest, earthquake, fire, etc., as punishments of God, see Isaiah 29:6, and Psalm 18:7, 8. \"Fire\" may well signify lightning (Job 1:16; Exodus 9:23). For a vivid description of a thunderstorm at Sinai, see Stewart's \"Tent and Khan,\" pp. 139, 140; ap. Stanley, \"Jew. Ch.,\" vol. 1. p. 149]: but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. [Heb. a voice of gentle silence. דְּמָמָה an onomatopoetic word, is allied to our word dumb. Very similar expression Job 4:16. What was the object and meaning of this succession of signs? First, let us remember that Elijah was the prophet of deeds. He taught his contemporaries not by word but by act. He is here taught in turn by signs. There passes before him in the mountain hollow, in the black and dark night, a procession of natural terrors-of storm, and earthquake, and fire. But none of these things move him; none speak to his soul and tell of a present God. It is the hushed voice, the awful stillness, overpowers and enchains him. He is to learn hence, first, that the Lord is a God \"merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth\" (Exodus 34:6); and secondly, that as it has been with himself, so it will be with others; the name of the Lord will be proclaimed in a voice of gentle silence (ib., ver. 5). The weapons of His warfare, the instruments of religious progress, must be spiritual, not carnal. Not in fire and sword and slaughter, but by a secret voice speaking to the conscience, will God regain His sway over the hearts of Israel. (See Homiletics.) The striking similarity between this theophany and that which Moses saw in the same place, or at no great distance from it, must not be overlooked, for this constitutes another link between law giver and law restorer. The proclamation of Exodus 34:3, 7 is the best exponent of the parable of vers. 11, 12. To each was the vision of God granted after a faithful witness against idolatry, and after a slaughter of idolaters; each was in a clift of the rock; in either case the Lord passed by; the one was taught by words, the other rather by signs, but the message in each case was the same - that judgment is God's strange work, but that He will by no means clear the guilty (cf. ver. 17).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.

This mantle (see note on 1 Kings 18:46) was probably a sheepskin. The LXX. calls it νηλωτή (cf. Hebrews 11:37). In Zechariah 13:4 we find that the prophets wore a mantle of hair], and went out, and stood [Same words as in ver. 11. It was the still small voice, apparently, that first brought him to obey the command there given. He would perhaps be afraid to issue from the shelter of his cave during the tempest and the earthquake, which may have followed directly after the instruction to go forth was given. Possibly there was a lesson for him here also, viz., that amid the din and excitement and torture of drought and famine and fire and blood the commands of God are less likely to be heard in the soul and obeyed, than in the hour of peace and stillness. The drought and famine and sword have their work to do, even as the tempest and the earthquake have theirs; but it is by the voice of mercy and love that the hearts of men are turned back again. \"Not in the strong east wind that parted the Red Sea, or the fire that swept the top of Sinai, or the earthquake that shook down the walls of Jericho would God be brought so near to man as in the still small voice of the child of Bethlehem\" (Stanley)] in the entering in of the cave. [He hardly obeyed the letter of the command of ver. 11 even then. Does not this point to a rebellious and unsubdued heart? Is it not a confirmation of the view taken above, that he fled to Horeb, full of bitter disappointment and murmuring against God; and that the purpose of this revelation was not only to teach him as to God's dealings with men, but also to school and subdue his own rebellious heart?] And, behold, there came a voice unto him [The expression is different from that of ver. 9. There we read of the \"word of the Lord,\" here of a \"voice.\" But this is not to be identified with the \"still small voice\" of ver. 12], and said, What doest, thou here, Elijah?

[Verbatim as in ver. 10. What are we to understand from this repetition of the former answer? Has the lesson of this theophany been lost upon him? Has he failed to grasp its significance? It is probable that he only partially understood its meaning, and it certainly looks as if he still felt himself an injured and disappointed man; as if the recollection of the way in which his work had been frustrated still rankled in his soul. But though the words are the same, it is possible, and indeed probable, that the tone was entirely different; that instead of speaking, as he had spoken before, querulously and almost defiantly, he now, catching his inspiration from the still small voice, speaks with bated breath and profound self humiliation. The facts are the same. He repeats them, because they and they alone explain why he is there, and because he cannot see as yet how they are to be remedied. But he is now conscious of a misgiving as to the wisdom and piety of his course. He feels he has acted hastily and faithlessly, and has wanted to do God's work in his own rough way. He will go back, if it be God's will; he will be content to wait God's time, and to follow His leading. The commission which is straightway given him almost proves that he had experienced a change. It implies that he is now fitted for his high ministry.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way [Heb. to thy way, as in Genesis 19:2; Genesis 32:2; Numbers 24:25, etc.] to the wilderness of Damacus [The construct case with ה local. Keil refers to Deuteronomy 4:41; Joshua 12:1; and Ewald 216 b. This cannot mean \"through the desert to Damascus,\" for he could not possibly go any other way, nor yet \"to the desert (through which he had just come) to Damascus,\" for he was then in the heart of the desert. He was to find a hiding place - we find the king of Damascus at war with Ahab, ch. 20. - or possibly a sphere for work, - he would be near Hazael - in the rugged desert which stretches south and east of the Syrian capital. (See Stanley, \"Sinai and Palestine,\" p. 410; Porter's \"Five Years in Damascus,\" vol. 2. p. 254 sqq.) Here, too, the prophet would be at no great distance from his own country. See on 1 Kings 17:3]: and Wheel thou comest, anoint [Heb. and thou shalt come and anoint. LXX. καὶ ἥξεις καὶ χρίσεις. The A.V. increases the difficulty. In the Hebrew the time of the anointing is indefinite. This commission has long been a crux interpretum. For neither Hazael, nor Jehu, nor Elisha, so far as we have any record, was ever anointed by Elijah. Elisha was called by him to the prophetic office. Hazael, it is barely possible, may have been anointed secretly, like David (1 Samuel 16:2, 13), but all that we gather from Scripture is, that he was called in an indirect way, and certainly not anointed, by Elisha (2 Kings 8:12-15). Jehu was certainly anointed, but it was neither by Elisha nor Elijah (2 Kings 9:1, 6), but by one of the sons of the prophets. All we can say, consequently, is that the command was obeyed in the spirit, and no doubt in the best possible time and way. There may have been good reasons, of which we know nothing, why Elijah should devolve the appointment of the two kings upon his successor, and we can readily understand that the word \"anoint\" was, as in Judges 9:8, Isaiah 61:1, never meant to be construed literally. For in the first place, we have no record elsewhere of the anointing of any prophet; and secondly, it is remarkable that when Elijah might so easily have anointed Elisha, he did nothing of the kind. It is clear, therefore, that he understood the word to mean \"appoint.\" And the root idea of anointing, it must be remembered, was the setting apart for the service of God (Exodus 29:6). Hence it was (Bahr) that vessels (Exodus 30:26 sqq.), and even stones (Genesis 28:18), were anointed. And when we find that these three persons were set apart sooner or later, and in different ways, to fulfil the high purposes of God, that ought to suffice us. The author of this history clearly found no difficulty in reconciling this account and that of 2 Kings 8:9. It has also been objected to this charge (Rawlinson) that it is no \"explanation or application of the preceding parable.\" But this is precisely what it appears to have been intended to be. The prophet is here taught by word much the same lesson that had been conveyed by signs, in the preceding vision. No doubt there are additional particulars - the vision dealt only with principles, the charge descends to details and prescribes duties - but still the great lesson that souls are to be won, that God's kingdom is to be advanced, not by wrath and vengeance, by fire and sword, but by meekness and gentleness, through the reason and the conscience, is proclaimed. Hazael and Jehu, each was God's instrument to punish; each was like the sweeping siena or the devouring fire, each was an engine of destruction; but by neither of these were the hearts Of men turned to the Lord. It was the sword of Elisha, the sword of his mouth (cf. Isaiah 11:4; Isaiah 49:2; Revelation 1:16; Revelation 2:16), should constrain men to hide their faces and humble themselves before God] Hazael [the seer of God.

Nimshi may have been a person of more importance than Jehoshaphat] of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel [The prophet thus learns that the house of Omri is to share the fate of the dynasties which had preceded it. Jezebel's triumph is not to endure]: and Elisha [My God is salvation. This name, berne by the successor of Elijah, \"My God is the Lord,\" looks like a fresh revelation of God's nature and purpose of grace] the son of Shaphat [Judge] of Abel-meholah [The mention of his abode, Abel-meholah, \"the meadow of the dance\" (cf. 1 Kings 4:12; Judges 7:22), a town in the Jordan valley, at no great distance from Beth-shean, almost implies that he was hitherto unknown to Elijah. It is to be observed that no such addition follows the mention of Hazael or Jehu] shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room [So far from Elijah's work being fruitless, or from the prophetic order being extinguished, provision is now made for his successor.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And it Shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael [See 2 Kings 8:12, 28; 2 Kings 10:32; 2 Kings 13:3, 22] shall Jehu slay [2 Kings 9:24-33; 2 Kings 10. passim. Cf. Isaiah 66:16]: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. [Elijah might reasonably interpret the commission to \"anoint\" Hazael, etc., as a figure, seeing there is an undoubted figure of speech here. Elisha was a man of peace. His sword was the \"sword of the Spirit, the word of God.\" It was by \"the breath of his lips he slew the wicked\" (Isaiah 2:4; 2 Thessalonians 2:8; Hosea 6:5). Not only are vers. 16, 17 an interpretation, in some sort, of the vision, but they are an answer to Elijah's complaint (vers. 10, 14). The \"children of Israel\" who had forsaken the covenant should be punished by Hazael (cf. 2 Kings 8:12, \"I know what thou wilt do unto the children of Israel,\" and cf. 1 Kings:32); the king and queen who had thrown down the altars and slain the prophets should be slain, one by the sword of Syria, the other at the command of Jehu; while to his allegation that the prophets were extinct and he was left alone is opposed the ordination of a successor, and the mention of the \"seven thousand\" in ver. 18.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Yet I have left me [So St. Paul, Romans 11:4, κατέλιπον; but the LXX.

See Gesen., Gram. § 124-26] seven thousand [not so much a round as a symbolical number - \"the ἐκλογή of the godly\" (Keil). \"The remnant according to the election of grace\" (Romans 11:5). It is like the 144,000 and the 12,000 of Revelation 7:4-8. The prominent idea is perhaps this: Though the children of Israel have forsaken My covenant, yet I have kept and will keep it. It also suggests how the still small voice had been speaking in the silence] in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. [We gather from Job 31:26, 27 that it was customary to kiss the hand to the idol, or object of worship, and from Hosea 13:2 to kiss the image itself.

But the meaning of the \"twelve yoke\" here is surely settled by the \"yoke of oxen;\" cf. ver. 21 and see below] before him [This word also points to animals, not land. The twelve pair of oxen, it is generally thought, are mentioned to show that Elisha was a man of substance. It is not certain, however, that all the twelve belonged to him. See next note], and he with the twelfth [\"I have seen more than a dozen ploughs thus at work. To understand the reason of this, several things must be taken into account.

The idea that he may have \"crossed the stream of the Jordan\" (Rawlinson) is extremely improbable. The current is strong, and it is not everywhere fordable, especially in winter], and cast his mantle upon him. [Heb. to him ךאלָיו. But LXX. ἐπ αὐτόν. Already, it would seem, the rough hairy mantle had come to be recognized as the garb of a prophet (cf. Zechariah 13:4). \"The prophet's cloak was a sign of the prophet's vocation\" (Keil). To cast the cloak to or upon Elisha was therefore an appropriate and significant way of designating him to the prophetic office. \"When Elijah went to heaven Elisha had the mantle entire\" 2 Kings 2:13 (Henry).

It is probable too that, Elisha being the last, Elijah's action would not have been observed by the rest], and ran after Elijah [It is clear that Elisha both understood the act, and made up his mind at once. No doubt he too had long sighed and prayed over the demoralization of his country and the dishonour done to his God. Elijah, after casting the mantle, strode on, leaving it for Elisha to take or reject it. The latter soon showed his choice by running after him], and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him; Go back again [Heb. go, return]: for what have I done to thee? [There is not a word of reproof here, as Wordsworth and Rawlinson imagine. Indeed, it would have been strange if there had been. A greater readiness to obey the prophetic summons, Elisha could not well have showed. Forthwith, as soon as he realized his call, \"he left the oxen and ran after\" his newmaster. True, he asks permission - and why should he not? for \"grace is no enemy to good nature\" - to give a parting embrace to the father and mother to whom he owed his life, and whom he had been required by God to honour. But there is no proof of \"a divided heart\" here. If he had begged to be allowed to stay and bury his mother and father (St. Luke 9:59-61) it might have been otherwise. But he suggests nothing of the kind. He says: \"One kiss, one farewell, and then I will follow thee.\" It is a complete mistake, consequently, to interpret Elijah's words to mean, \"Go, return to thy ploughing, for why shouldst thou quit it?... Thou canst remain as thou art\" (Rawlinson). Their true meaning, as evidenced by the sequel (ver. 21), clearly was, \"Go back and kiss them; why shouldst thou not? For what have I done to thee?

We have, e.g., Ab-salom in Per. 6, and Abi-athar in Per. 7] a [Heb. the] Shunammite [Shunem, a town of Issachar (Joshua 19:18), now called Solam, \"a flourishing village encompassed by gardens\" (Porter), and \"in the midst of the finest cornfields in the,world\" (Grove), lies on the lower slope of \"Little Hermon,\" and has before it the wide plain of Esdraelon. Another Shunammite appears in the sacred history (2 Kings 4:8)] and brought her to the king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And the damsel was very fair [lit. ,fair to exceeding] and cherished [see on ver. 2] the king, and ministered to him; but the king knew her not. [This is mentioned to explain the history of 1 Kings 2:13-25. Had it been otherwise, Adonijah could never have presumed to seek her in marriage, and Bathsheba would never have promised her help in his suit. Such an incestuous alliance would not only have been contrary to the law (Leviticus 18:8), but abhorrent to all true Israelites (cf. 1 Corinthians 5:1). In this fact, which the court knew, and which the nation at large did not know - they could only suppose that such a \"search\" for one so exceeding \"fair\" meant the increase of the seraglio - Adoni-jah found his point d'appui for a second attempt on the throne. The older expositors and some of the modern, notably Wordsworth, assume that Abishag was David's wife, in the sense of being legally married to him. (Corn. A Lap. discusses the question at considerable length, and with needless pruriency.) But this idea finds no support in Scripture, which represents her as simply an attendant. It is idle to remark, consequently, that \"the Jewish law allowed polygamy\" (Rawlinson).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Then Adonijah [ = \"Jehovah is my Lord.\" The fourth son of David, and now apparently the eldest surviving. It seems probable that Chileab, or Daniel (1 Chronicles 3:1), David's second son, died in infancy. For Amnon's death, see 2 Samuel 13:29; for Absalom's, 2 Samuel 18:14. He must now have been between thirty-three and forty years of age (having been born in Hebron)] the son of Haggith [ = \"Festive\" (Gesen.) \"the dancer\" (Stanley)] exalted himself, saying [to him self and his confederates], I will be king. [It is not difficult to trace this resolve to its sources. They wereNEWLINENEWLINE(1) his seniority (1 Kings 2:22). It is true there was no \"right of primogeniture\" in the Hebrew monarchy. \"The God King had reserved to Himself the choice of the earthly king\" (Keil). David himself was not the eldest, but the youngest brother. At the same time primogeniture, ceteris paribus, would have, and as a matter of fact had, considerable weight. The firstborn had the birthright; can we doubt he would expect the crown, and think it hard if he were passed over? (see 2 Chronicles 21:3).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) His personal attractions. Adonijah would think that his beauty and stature (Josephus mentions the latter) marked him out, as similar gifts had done Saul (1 Samuel 9:2),. for the throne.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) He was encouraged in his pretensions, if indeed they were not suggested to him, by others, by Joab, for example (see on ver. 7).NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Possibly love for the beautiful Shunammite and the desire to gain possession of her may have strengthened his resolves. It is noteworthy that he and his beauty are mentioned just after her and hers]: and he prepared [Hebrews made] him chariots and horsemen [rather horses, as in 1 Samuel 8:11; 1 Kings 5:6, Hebrews The former passage almost settles the meaning here. Keil assumes that a mounted escort is meant], and fifty men to run before him [as Absalom before him (2 Samuel 15:1). Adonijah seems in every way to have imitated Absalom. Josephus says he resembled him in disposition. Chariots, horses, and outrunners are mentioned (1 Samuel 8:11) as the very first of the king's insigina. Horses were such natural and familiar tokens of royal state (not being employed in agriculture or for travelling), that the Hebrew kings were warned (Deuteronomy 17:16) against multiplying them. Outrunners again, such as the Roman emperors had (called by them cursores), and such as we find at the present day in Egypt, footmen who precede the chariot at full speed, and by their shrill cries clear the way, are admirably calculated to impress the public mind. According to Morier, \"runners before the king's horse in Persia are indispensable to the royal state.\" Adonijah hoped by this display of regal pomp to win the suffrages of the people.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And his father had not displeased [or pained, afflicted.

Schmiat, e.g.) would understand since the days of his ambition and display\"] in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also [i.e., he also, as well as Absalom, mentioned presently; or, possibly, he as well as Abishag just mentioned. Bahr's rendering, \"Und dazu war er sehr schon,\" etc. \"And moreover he\" was, etc. will not stand] was a very goodly man [cf. 2 Samuel 14:25. This accounted in part not only for his ambition, but also for his following]; and his mother [the two last words are not in the original, which simply has \"and she bare,\" יָלְדָה. There is no need, Thenius, to read, רו ,תךענךג יָלַד with others, הולִיד. We have a similar ellipsis in Numbers 26:59. The meaning is quite clear, viz., that Haggith bare Adonijah to David next after Maachah bore him Absalom. This fact is mentioned to show that he was the eldest surviving son; and it shows therefore that seniority counted for something (cf. 1 Kings if. 25)] bare him after Absalom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And he conferred [Hebrews \"his words were\" (2 Samuel 3:17, Hebrews)] with Joab [Joab's share in this conspiracy, despite his hitherto unwavering fidelity to David, is easily accounted for. He must have known that he was under David's displeasure, and he must have feared, too, that he would be an object of dislike and distrust to a successor trained, as Solomon had been, under David's and Nathan's immediate influence. He could hardly be unconscious that under a new reign his position - unless he took measures to assure it - would be a precarious one. He resolved, therefore, to secure himself by helping Adonijah to his throne. It is also highly probable that Adonijah's ambitious character was much more to his liking than that of the pious and pacific Solomon. Adonijah's physical qualities, again, would no doubt commend him to this rough soldier, who may also have sympathised with him as the eldest son. And there may have been other circumstances (such, e.g., as close personal friendship), of which we know nothing] the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar [in 2 Samuel 8:17, we read that \"Ahimelech son of Abiathar\" was priest. Similarly, 1 Chronicles 24:6. An obvious transposition] the priest. [\"Abiathar's defection is still more surprising\" than Joab's (Rawlinson). It is certainly remarkable, when we consider the close ties which subsisted between Abiathar and David, ties which were cemented by the blood of eighty-five persons (1 Samuel 22:18), and strengthened by the many afflictions which they had shared in common (ibid. ver. 23 to 1 Kings 28; 2 Samuel 15:24-29), that he should have joined in a plot to defeat David's cherished hopes and plans - plans, too, which he must surely have known, had the sanction of religion (1 Chronicles 28:5), and there must have been some powerful motive to account for this. May we not find one in jealousy of Zadok, who had for some time been associated with him in the priesthood, who is generally mentioned first (2 Samuel 8:17; 2 Samuel 15:29, 35, 36; 2 Samuel 20:25). as if he were the more important and influential, and whose advancement, after the prophecy of 1 Samuel 2:33-36, Abiathar could not contemplate without suspicion and dread. Is it not highly probable that among the \"words\" Adonijah had with him was a promise to restore the priesthood to his family exclusively, as the reward of his allegiance]: and they following Adonijah helped him (lit., as marg., \"helped after Adonijah.\" It is a pregnant construction, \"they aided having followed the side of Adonijah\" (Gesenius).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But Zadok the priest [2 Samuel 8:17. It is generally said to be difficult to explain \"how Zadok and Abiathar came both to be \"priests at this time.\" Rawlinson, who adds that \"the best explanation is that Abiathar was the real high priest,\" officiating in Zion, while Zadok acted as chief priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon. (Bahr, by a strange oversight, assigns to Zadok the care of the ark on Mount Zion, whereas 1 Chronicles 16:39, distinctly connects his ministry with the tabernacle of witness at Gibeon.) But the precedence (see on ver. 7) generally assigned to Zadok is hardly consistent with the idea that Abiathar was \"the real high priest.\" The fact is that a duality of high priests, associated, apparently, on pretty equal terms, was not unknown in Jewish history. The cases of Eleazer and Ithamar, Hophni and Phinehas, Annas and Caiaphas, will occur to all. 2 Kings 25:18, speaks of \"the chief priest\" and \"the second priest;\" 2 Chronicles 31:10, of the \"chief priest of the house of Zadok.\" And a dual priesthood would be the more necessary in David's days, because of the two sanctuaries, Zion and Gibeon. We find, however, from 1 Chronicles 15:11, that Zadok was already priest at the time of the bringing up of the ark. And the true explanation, no doubt, is that Zadok had succeeded some member of his family, in all probability Jehoiada, called in 1 Chronicles 12:27, \"the leader of Aaron\" (Hebrews), who had certainly been high priest in the time of Saul (1 Chronicles 27:5), and who would hardly be degraded when, with 3700 followers, he joined David at Hebron. On his decease, or cession of orifice, Zadok, who had joined at the same time with a large contingent,was associated with Abiathar in the priest's office. This dual arrangement, consequently, was the result of David's having taken over a high priest from Saul, together with the kingdom, when he had Abiathar as priest already,] and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, [i.e., Jehoiada the high priest (1 Chronicles 27:5). Benaiah was consequently a Levite, and of the family of Aaron; set, however, by David, because of his prowess (2 Samuel 23:20, 21; 1 Chronicles 11:22) over the bodyguard (2 Samuel 8:18; 1 Chronicles 18:17). Probably he was a near relative of Zadok.], and Nathan the prophet [a Jewish tradition makes Nathan the eighth son of Jesse. He comes before us 2 Samuel 7:2, 3, 17; 2 Samuel 12:1-12, 25] and Shimei [by Ewald identified with Shammah (1 Samuel 16:9), or Shimeah, David's brother (2 Samuel 13:3; 2 Samuel 21:21). Others suppose him to be the Shimei of 1 Kings 4:18. But see note on chap. 2:8. Josephus calls Shimei (not Rei, as Bahr states) ὁ Δαυίδου φίλος], and Rei [this name occurs here only. Ewald would identify him with Raddai (1 Chronicles 2:14), another brother of David, but on very slender grounds], and the mighty men [or heroes.

It was a sacrificial feast, like Absalom's, 2 Samuel 15:12 (where see Speaker's note).

See Smith's \"Dict. Bible\" sub voc., where the various interpretations are given. The stone, which served as \"a natural altar for the sacrificial feast,\" the spring, which afforded \"water for the necessary ablutions,\" and the situation with respect to the adjoining city recommended this place as a rendezvous] which is by En-Rogel [Joshua 15:7; Joshua 18:16; 2 Samuel 17:17.

Josephus says it was without the city, in the royal garden (ἐν βασιλικῷ παραδείσῳ). The authorities are divided between the \"Fountain of the virgin\" (Ain um ed-Deraj), and the \"Well of Job\" (Bir Eyub.) See the arguments in Bonar's \"Land of Promise,\" App. 5; Thomson's \"Land and Book,\" vol. 2 p. 528; and Mr. Grove's Art. in Smith's \"Dict.

They too, if living, would naturally resent the preference of the youngest brother], and all the men of Judah, the king's servants [\"all the Judeans who were serving at court, as being members of his own tribe\" (Keil). The fierce jealousy between Ephraim and Judah would almost compel the king to surround himself with soldiers and attendants of the latter tribe. Some of the invited guests, no doubt, like Absalom's two hundred, \"went in their simplicity and knew not anything\" (2 Samuel 15:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. [It is clear from this verse that Adonijah perfectly understood that he had in Solomon a rival. The intentions and promises (ver. 13) of his father can hardly have been unknown to him. The name \"Jedidiah, too, bestowed upon Solomon by Nathan (2 Samuel 12:25), taken in connexion with the prophecy of Nathan (ibid. 2 Samuel 7:12; cf. 1 Chronicles 22:9, 10), must have proved to him that Solomon was marked out for David's successor. He seems to have been well aware also who were Solomon's supporters. To some of them he may have made indirect overtures. The historian having recorded Adonijah's preparations for a coup d'etat, now relates the manner in which the plot was frustrated. The prophet, who had been the guardian and preceptor of Solomon's youth, and who knew the Divine will respecting the succession (1 Chronicles 22:9, 10), takes prompt and energetic measures to defeat the conspiracy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon [the person after Solomon most directly concerned and also best fitted to approach the king] saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith [possibly there is a touch of worldly wisdom here, as Rawlinson suggests, \"Haggith, thy rival.\" We may be sure David's harem was not without its fierce jealousies. But (see ver. 5, and 1 Kings 2:13) the patronymic is so common in Hebrews that we cannot safely found an argument upon it. See on chap. 2:5] doth reign [Hebrews did reign.

The custom of Eastern kings - to secure their thrones by a massacre of their rivals - has received many illustrations, notably among the Ottomans, and is receiving one in Burmah at the present moment (May, 1879). We have Scripture instances in Judges 9:5; 1 Kings 15:29; 2 Kings 10:7, 14; 2 Kings 11:1 (cf. 1 Samuel 24:21). To put a royal mother to death, along with her offspring, though perhaps unusual, was not unknown. Rawlinson cites the instances of Cleopatra, widow of Philip of Macedon, who was murdered with her infant son Caranus by Olympias; and Roxana, widow of Alexander the Great, who, with her son, was put to death by Cassander.

It does not prove that \"there was a disinterested witness present\" (Rawlinson), for she may have withdrawn, as Bathsheba did presently (ver. 23), and Nathan (ver. 32).

These variations are of very little consequence, but the received text, in both cases, is somewhat the more spirited] my lord, O king [the repetition (see vers. 18, 21, 24, 27) illustrates the profound deference and court paid to the Hebrew monarch (see on ver. 16), especially when we remember that these are the words of a wife], the eyes of all Israel are upon thee (cf. 1 Kings 2:15) that thou shouldest ten them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. This shows that there was no \"right of primogeniture.\" The kings of the East have always designated their successor amongst their sons. \"Alyattes designated Croesus; Cyrus designated Cambyses, and Darius designated Xerxes\" (Rawlinson). \"The Shah of Persia, at the eginning of this century, had sixty sons, all brought up by their mothers, with the hope of succeeding\" (Holier, quoted by Stanley).

The primary meaning of חָטָא is \"to miss the mark.\" Like ἁμαρτάνειν, it came to be used of all erring and transgression.

He does not deny a previous interview with Bathsheba, nor does he confess it. If there is an appearance of artifice, there was no intention to deceive. And the artifice, such as it was, was not only harmless, but for the public good. Verse 22. - And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet [we are scarcely justified in seeing in this \"solemn announcement of his approach\" an \"indication of the consideration in which he was held\" (Stanley).

Bahr's accidental miscitation (ver. 10 for ver. 9) has apparently led his American translator (p. 24) to the serious mistake of identifying these \"captains of the host\" with \"the mighty men\" (Gibborim) of ver. 10, who, it is distinctly said, \"were not with Adonijah] and Abtathar the priest, and behold, they eat and drink before him [convivia apta conjurationibus.

It is characteristic of David to introduce into the formula some such clause as the following], that hath redeemed my soul [i.e., life] out of all distress. Same expression as in 2 Samuel 4:9. Similar expressions are found in Psalm 25:22, and Psalm 34:22. The repeated deliverance out of straits and danger - \"out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul\" - was one of the most remarkable features of David's life, and it is no wonder that he repeatedly commemorates it, converting every adjuration into an act of thanksgiving.

Genesis 39:2; Genesis 42:30; 2 Kings 2:3, 5, 16), suggested to David by the usus loquendi of the court. This expression seems at first a strange periphrasis for \"my servants.\" But David naturally adopts the language those around him were always using. See ver. 43; also 2 Samuel 11:11, and 2 Sam 20:6. Note: The latter passage, which refers to the king, has the plur.; the former, referring to Joab, the sing.] and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, [lit., \"the she mule\" (the most prized in the East. Cf. Judges 5:10, Hebrews) \"which is mine.\" This was not merely a mark of honour (cf. Genesis 41:43; Esther 6:8, 9), but a public and very significant indication of David's will respecting his successor. The populace would perceive at once who was destined to sit in David's seat. \"The Rabbins tell us that it was death to ride on the king's mule without his permission\" (Rawlinson). פִרְדָּה, the fem. form is only found here and in vers. 38, 44. The mule would seem to have been a recent importation into Palestine - we never read of them before the time of David - and the Israelites were forbidden to breed them (Leviticus 19:19). Their use, consequently, was naturally restricted to royal or distinguished personages (2 Samuel 13:29). Wordsworth sees in the word a proof that David had not disobeyed God by multiplying horses to himself], and bring him down to Gihon. [Not Gibeon, which Thenius most arbitrarily would substitute for the received text. Where was Gihon? The popular belief (accepted by Bahr and Keil, as well as by some geographers) is that it was in the valley of the Son of Hinnom, a part of which still bears the name of Gihon, i.e., to the west of Jerusalem, and not far from the Jaffa gate. By many indeed the present Birket-es-Sultan is identified with the Lower Pool of Gihon. But others (Ferguson, Rawlinson, etc.) see in it the ancient name of the Tyropaeon. Scripture does not speak of it as a spring, though the \"source of the waters of Gihon\" is mentioned 2 Chronicles 32:30, Hebrews The text shows that it was below the city (\"bring him down upon Gihon,\" ver. 33. Cf. also ver. 40). 2 Chronicles 33:14, speaks of \"Gihon in the valley,\" where it is very noticeable that the word used is Nachal (i.e. Wady, watercourse). But this \"is the word always employed for the valley of the Kedron, east of Jerusalem, the so called valley of Jehoshaphat; ge (ravine or glen) being as constantly employed for the valley of Hinnom, south and west of the town\" (Grove,\" Dict. Bible,\" art. Gihon). It is also to be noticed that the text last cited mentions Gihon in connection with Ophel, which lies southeast of Jerusalem.. The Chald., Arab., and Syr. are probably right, therefore, in identifying Gihon here with Siloam (which lies at the foot of Ophel), in favour of which it may further be said that it would be admirably suited for David's purpose - of a counter demonstration - and that whether En-Rogel is to be found at the Well of the Virgin or the Well of Job. Siloam is at no great distance from either, and quite within earshot, whereas the traditional Gihon is altogether out of the way. It must be borne in mind that this procession to and from Gihon was ordained, not because there was any special reason for anointing Solomon there ? for it was not a holy place - but purely as a demonstration to the populace, and to checkmate the conspirators. It was probably a public place, and would accommodate a large concourse (Poole).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet [Bahr sees in the fact that Nathan was associated with Zadok in the anointing, \"the high significance David attributed to the prophetic office in Israel\" But the prophets constantly performed this ceremony. Samuel anointed both Saul and David; Elisha anointed Jehu (2 Kings 9:1), and was commissioned to anoint Hazael (1 Kings 19:15, 16) ] anoint him [the king, being a sacred personage, was set apart to the office, like the priest and prophet, by anointing. Saul was probably anointed twice (1 Samuel 10:1; 1 Samuel 11:15. Cf. 12:3). David was anointed thrice (1 Samuel 16:13; 2 Samuel 2:4; 2 Samuel 5:3. Solomon was anointed twice (ver. 39; 1 Chronicles 29:22). The Rabbins have always held that subsequent kings were not anointed, where the succession was regular. But this opinion must be taken quantum valet. It is true that we only read of the anointing of Jehu (2 Kings 9:6), Joash (ibid. 2 Kings 11:12), and Jehoahaz (ibid. 2 Kings 23:30), and that in these three cases the accession was irregular. But it is obvious that other kings may have been anointed as well, though the fact is not recorded. There would be no reason for recording it in ordinary cases It seems hardly likely, too, that any king would readily dispense with an ordinance which would so much strengthen his title] there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet [the sound of the trumpet would almost seem to have been a necessary accompaniment of coronations, or the proclamation of a new king. See 2 Samuel 15:10; 2 Kings 9:13; 2 Kings 11:14], and say, God cave king Solomon. [See on ver. 25.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Then ye shall come up (after him [not in the LXX. Cod.

Cf. vers. 46, 51, 53; 1 Chronicles 29:23, 26], and I have appointed him [he and him are emphasised in the original] to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. It is possible, as Bahr thinks, that Israel and Judah were severally mentioned because David had once been king over Judah only, and because Israel had gone over to the side of Absalom. It is more probable, however, that \"Israel and Judah\" was even then the current designation of the two component parts of the realm (see 2 Samuel 2:9, 10; 2 Samuel 19:11, 41, etc.). Besides, we can hardly suppose that the historian has in every case, though he probably has in this, preserved the exact words of the speaker; and it need cause us no surprise had he put into David's mouth the phraseology of a later age. In the nature of things he can only give us the substance of conversations such as these.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And Benaiah the son of Johoiada [probably he spoke, not because the execution of the order depended upon him (Bahr); for both Zadok and Nathan had a much more important part to perform, but as a blunt soldier who was accustomed to speak his mind] answered the king and said, Amen: the Lord God [lit., \"Jehovah, he God,\" etc.] of my lord the king say so too.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - As the Lord hath been with my lord the king [cf. 1 Samuel 20:13. \"This phrase expresses a very high degree of the Divine favour\" (Rawlinson). See Genesis 26:3, 4; Genesis 28:15; Genesis 39:2, 21; Exodus 3:12; Joshua 1:5; 1 Chronicles 22:11, etc.], even so be he with Solomon, and make has throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. [This was said from a full and honest heart, not to flatter David's vanity (Thenius). It is thoroughly characteristic of the man so far as we know him. And the prayer was fulfilled (1 Kings 3:11, 12).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites [these were the royal bodyguard - Σωματοφύλακες Josephus calls them - who were commanded by Benaiah (2 Samuel 8:18; 2 Samuel 15:18; 2 Samuel 20:23; 2 Samuel 23:28). But while their functions are pretty well understood, great difference of opinion exists as to the origin or meaning of the words. By some they are supposed to be Gentile names. A tribe of Cherethites is mentioned 1 Samuel 30:14. (Cf. Ezekiel 25:16; Zephaniah 2:5), and in close connexion with the Philistines (ver. 16). Hence Cherethite has been thought to be another name for Philistine; and as the LXX. and Syr. render the word \"Cretans,\" it has been conjectured that the Philistines had their origin from Crete. They did come from Caphtor, and that is probably Crete (see Genesis 10:14; Jeremiah 47:4; Amos 9:7; Deuteronomy 2:23). פְּלֵתִי again, is not unlike פְּלִשְּׁתִי In favor of this view is the fact that David certainly had a bodyguard of foreign mercenaries (2 Samuel 15:18, where the \"Gittites\" are connected with the Cherethites). Nor does it make against it that \"two designations\" would thus \"be employed side by side for one and the same people\" - as if we should speak of Britons and Englishmen (Bahr). For the names look like a paronomasia - of which the Jews were very fond - and a trick of this kind would at once account for the tautology. [Since writing this, I find the same idea has already occurred to Ewald.] But the other view, adopted by Gesenius, is that the names are names of office and function. Cherethite he would derive from תָרַכ, cut, slay; and by Cherethites he would understand \"executioners,\" which the royal bodyguard were in ancient despotisms (Genesis 39:1, Hebrews; Daniel 2:14, etc. See on 1 Kings 2:25). In the Pelethites (פֶּלֶת, swiftness) he would see the public couriers (ἄγγαροι) of Eastern men. archies (see Herod. 8:98 and 2 Chronicles 30:6). We see the guard discharging the function first named in 2 Kings 10:25; 2 Kings 11:4, 8; and the latter in 1 Kings 14:27 (marg.)] went down [i.e., from the palace on Mount Zion] and caused Solomon to ride upon King David's mule, and brought him to [עַל: cf. 2:26] Gihon [Chald., Syr., Arab., Shiloha].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon.

The \"holy anointing oil,\" Exodus 30:25, 31, compounded as directed in vers. 23-25, was evidently part of the furniture of the tabernacle (Exodus 31:11; Exodus 39:38). Eleazer was charged with its preservation (Numbers 4:16), and the Rabbins say it lasted till the captivity] out of the tabernacle [the tabernacle on Mount Zion, containing the ark (2 Samuel 6:17; 1 Chronicles 15:1) must be meant here. There was not time to have gone to the tabernacle at Gihon (Stanley), which was three hours distance from Jerusalem (Keil). Though Abiathar had charge of this sanctuary, yet Zadok would readily gain access to it, especially in the king's name] and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet [cf. 2 Samuel 15:10; 2 Kings 9:13; 2 Kings 11:14]; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. [Notice the exact fulfilment of the threefold charge of ver. 34 and its result. Solomon was confirmed in his office by the suffrages of the people.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And all the people came up after him [same expression as ver. 35. The procession, the sound of the trumpets, etc., had collected a large crowd, which followed Solomon on his return], and the people piped [Hebrews were piping] with pipes [pipes or flutes were used on occasions of rejoicing (Isaiah 5:12; Isaiah 30:29. Cf. 1 Samuel 10:5), and so of mourning (Jeremiah 48:36; Matthew 9:23). It is true that a very slight change (מְחֹלְלִיפ בְּחלִיִם instead of מִחַלְּלִים בַּחֲלִלִים) will give the meaning, \"dancing with dances,\" which Ewald prefers, on the ground that \"all the people\" could not have produced their pipes at a moment's notice. But the objection loses its force when it is observed (Rawlinson) that the text implies that only some of the people piped. \"All the people came up... and the people,\" etc. Besides, even if it were not so, some allowance is surely to be made for Eastern hyperbole. And the received text is to be preferred on other grounds. The LXX., however, has ἐχόρευον ἐν χοροῖς], and rejoiced with great joy [Hebrews \"were rejoicing a great joy\"], and the earth rent [this is certainly a strangly hyperbolical expression. For בָּקַע strictly means to cleave asunder, tear open (see, e.g., Numbers 16:31; Amos 1:13; 2 Chronicles 25:12). And Thenius suggests a slight emendation of the text, viz., וַתִּתָּקַע (i.e., \"resounded\") for וַתִּבָּקַע which would obviate this difficulty. He points out that while the LXX. Cod.

Victims were bound to them (Psalm 118:27), and blood was put upon them, Exodus 29:12. As to the altar as a place of sanctuary, see on 1 Kings 2:28. Evidently a right of sanctuary existed amongst both Jews and Gentiles at the time of the Exodus, and probably from time immemorial. It is referred to in Exodus 21:14, but it was much circumscribed by the appointment of the cities of refuge (Numbers 35:10 sqq.) By \"laying hold of the horns the offender thereby placed himself under the protection of the saving and helping grace of God\" (Bahr, \"Symbolik,\" 1:474)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold Adonijah feareth King Solomon, for lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, let king Solomon [this repetition of the title is striking. Both courtiers and criminals hasten to give the young king his new honours. In Adonijah's mouth it is also a virtual abdication of his claim to the throne and a direct acknowledgment of the new monarch. But see on vers. 1 and 35.] swear unto me today [Cf. 2 Samuel 19:23. This is one of many passages which show how lightly the Jews esteemed promises in comparison with oaths. The sentiment possibly took its rise in the oaths sworn by the Divine Being (Genesis 22:16; Genesis 24:7; Exodus 16:16, etc.), though it is possible, on the other hand, that these asseverations were made in deference to the popular sentiment. Be that as it may, the oath held a much more conspicuous and important place in the Jewish than the Christian economy. See Genesis 21:23; Genesis 31:23; Numbers 14:2; Numbers 30:2; Judges 15:12; Judges 21:1; 1 Samuel 14:28; Jeremiah 5:2, and, to omit other passages, 1 Kings 1:13; 1 Kings 2:8, 23, 42. Even our Lord, who rebuked the habit (Matthew 5:34-37; Matthew 23:16-22) respected the adjuration of Caiaphas, and St. Paul frequently appeals to God (Acts 26:29; 2 Corinthians 1:23; 2 Corinthians 11:31; Philippians 1:8.) The Christian religion, as it has gradually begotten a reverence for truth, has made the simple word into a bond] that he will not slay his servant [Cf. \"I will be King,\" ver. 5.] with the sword [the usual form of capital punishment, 1 Kings 2:8, 25, 31, 46. Adonijah indirectly confesses that he had merited death]. Verse 51. - And Solomon said [i.e., he refused to swear], If he will shew himself a worthy man [בֶּן־חַיִל, cf. אִיש־חַיִל, ver. 1 Kings 1:42], there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth [i.e., not a single hair shall be injured. Same expression 1 Samuel 14:45; 2 Samuel 14:11; Acts 27:34. It was evidently a familiar saying] but if wickedness shall be found in him, [i.e., if he shall commit any fresh crime] he shall die [Hebrew וָמֵת, \"then he shall die,\" emphatic.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings1:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.

He was still clinging to it] the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon [i.e., made obeisance to him as king. Cf. vers. 16, 23, 31] and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house. This was not a sentence of banishment from court, but merely a dismissal to a private life, involving a tacit admonition to live quietly and be thankful that his life was spared him. \"Vade in domum tuam, ibi quiesce et res tuas age, nec te publicis regni mei negotiis immisceas\" (Corn.

The LXX. uniformly spells the name Ader (υἱὸςἌδερ). The form אֲדַד is found in 1 Kings 11:17, and ד and ר are frequently interchanged; cf. Genesis 25:15; Genesis 36:39 with 1 Chronicles 1:30, 46. We learn from ver. 34 that this prince was the son of a Syrian king who had conquered some of the cities of Israel, but we cannot nevertheless be certain that he was the son of that Ben-hadad (1 Kings 15:18) who invaded Israel in the reign of Baasha (Ewald), See on ver. 34.] the king of Syria gathered all his host [See note on 1 Kings 10:2, where we have same word] together: and there were thirty and two kings with him [Evidently these were vassals, not allied powers. The number alone proves that they must have been petty princes or chieftains of Hittite tribes, ruling over very limited districts' and all acknowledging the suzerainty of the king of Damascus, all paying tribute (1 Kings 10:25) and furnishing a contingent in time of war \"The Assyrian inscriptions show that this country was, about the period in question, parcelled out into a number of petty kingdoms,\" etc. (Rawlinson. See \"Records of the Past,\" vol. 12. p. 20)], and horses, and chariots [Heb. horse and chariot; cf. ver. 21 and 1 Kings 1:5; 1 Kings 10:26; 1 Kings 16:9, etc. Both are collective nouns. We see here the fruit and retribution of Solomon's irreligious policy (1 Kings 10:29 and Homiletics, p. 216). \"A king who has been probably identified with this Ben-hadad brought into the field against Assyria nearly 4000 chariots\" (Rawlinson)]: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it. [The object of this expedition was clearly to humble and to plunder the kingdom of Samaria. It would almost appear, from the animus of the Syrian king and the studied offensiveness of his messages, as if Ahab or Israel must have given him dire offence. But Ben-hadad was clearly a vain and overbearing and tyrannical prince, and the only crime of Israel may have been that it was independent of him, or had refused to do him homage.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into [Heb. to. It is not clear that they entered the city. They may have delivered their message to the king, or to his representatives at the gates or to the people on the walls (2 Kings 18:18, 27)] the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thy silver and thy gold is mine [Heb. mine it is]; thy wives also and thy children [Nothing reveals Ben-hadad's object more clearly than the mention of Ahab's wives. When we consider how jealously the seraglio of an Eastern prince is guarded, and how the surrender of the harem is a virtual surrender of the throne (2 Samuel 16:21, 22; note on 1 Kings 2:22), and certainly a surrender of all manhood and self-respect, we see that his aim was to wound Ahab in his tenderest point, to humble him to the lowest depths of degradation, and possibly to force a quarrel upon him], even the goodliest [The LXX. omits this. Bahr says the word can only apply to the sons, and that it must mean the most eminent young men of the city - not Ahab's children - whom Ben-hadad demanded as hostages. But against this isNEWLINENEWLINE(1) Ahab's answer, \"All that I have,\" etc.;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the fact that Ben-hadad obviously meant insult and plunder; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the language of ver. 7, where see note], are mine. [Heb. mine are they. Rawlinson would explain this excessive demand of the Syrian king by the assumption that when it was made the siege had already lasted a long time, and that the people were now reduced to the greatest straits, circumstances which the historian, with the characteristic brevity of the sacred writers, omits to mention. But really no such supposition is needed. The overwhelming force which Ben-hadad had at his back would, in his eyes, justify any demands. And the prima facie view of ver. 2 is that the messengers were sent on the first approach of the army, or rather at the beginning of the siege.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have. [Much has been written about Ahab's pusillanimous acquiescence in these disgraceful terms, etc. But it is not absolutely clear that he ever meant to surrender either wives or children to the invader. All that is certain is that he judged it wise, in the presence of the enormous force arrayed against him, to make every possible concession, to adopt the most subservient tone, and to cringe at the feet of Ben-hadad. But all the time he may have hoped that his soft answer would turn away wrath. It is very far from certain that had Ben-hadad sent to demand the wives and children which Ahab here seems willing to yield to him they would have been sent. When Ben-hadad threatens (ver. 6) a measure which involved much less indignity than the surrender of the entire seraglio to his lusts, Ahab stands at bay. Allowance must be made for the exaggerations of Eastern courtesy. The writer was entertained in 1861 by Jacob esh Shellabi, then sheykh of the Samaritans, who repeatedly used words very similar to these. \"This house is yours,\" he would say; never meaning, however, that he should be taken at his word.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying, Although [Heb. כִּי. According to some of the grammarians, this is merely the Hebrew equivalent of the ὅτι recitantis. But the כִּי אִם of the next verse suggests that there must be a connexion between the two, and that the second emphasizes the first, much as in the A.V.] I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children [Our translators have often sacrificed force to elegance by disregarding the order of the Hebrew, which here, e.g., is \"Thy silver and thy gold... to me thou shalt give them.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Yet I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time [This proposal was definite and immediate, the first demand was vague and general. \"In the first Ahab was to send what he thought fit to give; in the second, Ben-hadad's servants were to take into their own hands whatsoever they thought fit to sieze\" (Wordsworth)], and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in [Heb. the desire of] thine eyes [The LXX. and some other versions have a plural suffix - their eyes. But the Hebrew text is to be preferred. The object of Ben-hadad was to couch his message in the most oftensive and humiliating terms, and \"the desire of thine eyes\" would be likely to cut deeper and wound more than \"the desire of their eyes\"], they shall put it in their hand, and take it away. [If Ahab ever hoped by his abject submission to conciliate the Syrian king, he now finds that his words have had just the opposite effect. For all that the latter concluded from it was that Ahab was one upon whom he might trample at pleasure, and this servility encouraged Ben-hadad to renew his demands in a still more galling and vexatious form. This second message discloses to us still more plainly the royal bully and braggart, and shows us what the \"comity of nations\" in the old world was often like.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land [Bahr remarks that this expression, compared with \"the elders of the city\" (1 Kings 21:8, etc.), suggests either that these nobles, as the highest officials, had their residences at the court, or upon the approach of Ben-hadad had betaken themselves thither with their treasures. Rawlinson builds on this slender basis the conclusion that the council of elders which, he says, belonged to the undivided kingdom, had been continued among the ten tribes, had an important place in the government, and held regular sittings at the capital] and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man [or fellow. The זֶה expresses either hatred or contempt. Cf. 1 Kings 22:27; Luke 23:2, 18, etc.] seeketh mischief [the purport of Ahab's address is not, \"Ben-hadad is not satisfied with my treasures; he wants yours also\" (Bahr), for there is no reference whatsoever to their property, but, \"See how he is determined on our ruin. Nothing short of our destruction will suffice him. He is bent on provoking an encounter, that he may plunder the city at pleasure.\" The salient word is the רָעָה]: far he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children [LXX. περι τῶν υἱῶν μου. This shows clearly that \"the most eminent young men \"cannot be meant in ver. 3], and for my silver and for my gold: and I dented him not. [What these words mean depends on what ver. 4 (where see note) means. It is difficult to conceive that any monarch could gravely proclaim his own shame to his counsellors; could confess, that is, that he had consented to surrender his children and concubines without a struggle.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And an the eiders and an the people [not only, i.e., the inhabitants of Samaria (Keil), but also those who had flea thither for refuge.

But we must remember that a man is ready to promise almost anything in his extremity, and that we do not know what construction he put, or would have claimed to put, upon Ben-hadad's first demand, had that monarch consented to revert to these conditions, or by what means he hoped to evade it].

[Heb. that are in my feet. Same expression Judges 4:16; Judges 5:15; 1 Samuel 25:27; 2 Samuel 15:17, etc. This thoroughly Oriental piece of bluster and boasting, which was intended, no doubt, to strike terror into the hearts of king and people, has been variously interpreted, but the meaning appears to be sufficiently clear. Ben-bahad vows that he will make Samaria a heap of dust, and at the same time affirms that so overwhelming is his host, that this dust will be insufficient to fill the hands of his soldiers. Rawlinson compares with it the well-known saying of the Trachinian to Dieneces, that the Median arrows would obscure the sun (Herod. 7:226), but 2 Samuel 17:18 is still more apposite.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him Let not him that girdeth on his harness bout himself as he that putteth it off.

The word shows that, in lieu of tents, kings and generals on an expedition sometimes used leafy huts, like those of Israel (Leviticus 23:34, 42). Such booths, it is said, are still erected on military expeditions in the East], that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array [Heb. שִׂימוּ one short, decisive word. His indignation and astonishment were too great for more. We might perhaps render \"Form.\" Cf. 1 Samuel 11:11; Joshua 8:2, 13; Job 1:17; Ezekiel 23:24. It cannot mean οἰκοδομήσατε χάρακα (LXX.)] And they set themselves in array [or formed.

Cf. 1 Kings 13:11. According to Jewish writers, this was Micaiah, son of Imlah, but 1 Kings 22:8 negatives this supposition, This is another proof that all the prophets had not been exterminated. Where Elijah was at this time, or why he was not employed, we have no means of determining. Bahr says that he was \"least of all suited for such a message,\" but not if he had learned the lesson of 1 Kings 19:12. At the same time, it is to be remembered that he invariably appears as the minister of wrath. It may also be reasonably asked why this gracious interposition was granted to the kingdom of Samaria at all. Was not this invasion, and would not the sack of the city have been, a just recompense for the gross corruption of the age, for the persecution of the prophets, etc.? But to this it may be replied that Ben-hadad was not then the instrument which God had designed for the correction of Israel (see 1 Kings 19:17; 1 Kings 22:31; 2 Kings 10:32), and furthermore that by his brutal tyranny and despotic demands, he had himself merited a chastisement. The city, too, may have been delivered for the sake of the seven thousand (1 Kings 19:18; 2 Kings 19:34. Cf. Genesis 18:26 sqq.) But this gracious help in the time of extremity was primarily designed as a proof of Jehovah's power over the gods of Syria (cf. vers. 13, 28; 1 Kings 18:39; 2 Kings 19:22 sqq.), and so as an instrument for the conversion of Israel. His supremacy over the idols of Phoenicia had already been established] unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? [el. ver. 10. \"In Ben-hadad's wars with the Assyrians, we sometimes find him at the head of nearly 100,000 men\" (Rawlinson).] Behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.

He is careful to give special prominence to the sacred name, as the only help in trouble (Psalm 20:1, 5, 7, etc.)], Even by the young men [or servants - נַעַר has both meanings, corresponding with παῖς (cf. Genesis 37:2; 2 Kings 5:20; 2 Kings 8:4] of the princes of the provinces. [The local governors (cf. 1 Kings 4:7; 1 Kings 10:15), on the approach of Ben hadad, had apparently fled to the capital. Whether these \"young men\" were their \"pages\" (Thenius), or even were \"young lads\" (Ewald) at all, or, on the contrary, a \"select body of strong young men\" (Bahr), the bodyguard of the various governors (2 Samuel 18:15) (Von Gerlach), may be doubtful; but when Bahr says that Ahab would not have consented to appoint weak boys to lead the van, at least without remonstrance, he must have forgotten that all the ordinary means at Ahab's disposal were equally insufficient, and that in themselves 200 or 2000 tried veterans would have been just as inadequate a force as 200 pages. The agency by which the victory was won was purposely weak and feeble (per turbam imbellem), in order that the work might be seen to be of God (cf. Judges 7:2; 1 Corinthians 1:27, 29). And this consideration makes against the supposition that the attacking body was composed of tried and skilful warriors.] Then he said, Who shall order [Heb. bind; we speak of \"joining battle\"] the battle? [The meaning is - not, \"who shall command this force,\" but, \"which side shall begin the fray?\"] And he answered, Thou [i.e., thy band of young men shall make the attack.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Then he numbered [or reviewed (cf.

Theodoret remarks that by this band - 230, as he understood it - Almighty God would destroy the hosts of thirty and two kings. The numbers may have been recorded because of the correspondency]: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand. [This number is of course to be understood, unlike that of ch. 19:18, literally. And the context (cf. ver. 19) shows that this was the number of fighting men. But this small army can hardly fail to create surprise, especially if we compare it with the statistics of the soldiery of an earlier age (2 Samuel 24:9; 1 Chronicles 21:5; 2 Chronicles 13:3; 2 Chronicles 14:8). It is true this was not strictly an army, but a garrison for the defence of the capital. But it looks very much as if, under the feeble rule of Ahab, the kingdom of Israel had become thoroughly disorganized. \"The position of Jarchi is that of a true Rabbi, viz., that the 7000 were those who had not bowed the knee unto Baal (1 Kings 19:18),\" Bahr.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went out at noon.

[\"At the time when Ben-hadad, haughty and confident, had given himself up with his vassals, to the table, news of which had probably been received in the city\" (Bahr).

It can hardly have been to \"mark his utter contempt of the foe,\" Rawlinson, who compares Belshazzar's feast (Daniel 5:1-4) when besieged by Cyrus. But Ben-hadad was the besieger.

Possibly, the unusual stir in the city, the mustering of the troops, etc., had led to his sending out scouts before the young men issued from the gates. The LXX., however, has \"And they send and tell the king of Syria,\" which Rawlinson thinks represents a purer text.

It was a sauve qui pout. \"The hasty and disordered flight of a vast Oriental army before an enemy contemptible in numbers is no uncommon occurrence. Above 1,000,000 of Persians fled before 47,000 Greeks at Arbela\" (Rawlinson). The very size of such hosts, especially where the command is divided and where the generals are drunk or incapable, contributes to their defeat]; and Israel pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse [Thenius suggests that this was a chariot horse, the first that presented] with the horsemen.

Several late wars, notably those of our own armies in Africa and Afghanistan, have been considerably influenced by the seasons. And the wars of ancient times were almost universally summer raids. \"Sustained invasions, lasting over the winter, are not found until the time of Shalmaneser\" (2 Kings 17:5; 2 Kings 18:9 10, Rawlinson)] the king of Syria will come [Heb. cometh] up against thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him [naturally anxious to retrieve their character and obliterate their disgrace], Their gods are gods of the hills [All pagan nations have believed in local deities, Dii montium, dii nemorum, etc. (see 2 Kings 18:33-35; 2 Kings 19:12, 13). Keil accounts for this belief - that the gods of Israel were mountain divinities, by the consideration that the temple was built on Mount Moriah, and that worship was always offered on \"high places.\" Kitto reminds us that the law was given from Mount Sinai, and that fire had recently descended on Mount Carmel. \"In Syrophoenicia, even mountains themselves had Divine honours paid to them\" (Movers, Phoen. 1:667 sqq.) But it is enough to remember that Samaria was a hilly district, and that the courtiers must find some excuse for the defeat]; therefore they were stronger than we; but [Heb. (וְאוּלָם often well rendered but not in this instance) by the LXX. οὐ μὴν δὲ ἀλλά] let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. [This counsel, which apparently rests on religious grounds alone, was, it is probable, really dictated by the practical consideration that in the plain the Syrians would be able to deploy their chariots a most important arm of their service in a way which they could not do in the valleys round Samaria. See 1 Kings 16:24, note. Moreover the Israelites would lose the advantage of a strong position and the cover of their fortifications if they could be induced to meet them in the \"great plain,\" or on any similar battlefield.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. ?

[Not so much because (Bahr) the kings only fought through compulsion, for they appear to have been in complete accord with Ben-hadad (vers. 1, 12, 16), as because of their incapacity and divided interests and plans. The captains would presumably be selected because of their valour, military skill, etc.; the kings would owe their command to the accident of birth, etc. Moreover an army with thirty-three leaders could not have the necessary solidarity. Bahr assumes that the removal of the kings would involve the withdrawal of the auxiliaries which they contributed. But this does not appear to have occurred to Ben-ha(lad's advisers when they said, \"put captains in their rooms.\" If the auxiliaries were withdrawn, what were the thirty-two captains to command ?]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.

And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered the Syrians [Heb. Syria], and went up to Aphek [As the word signifies \"fortress,\" it is only natural that several different places should bear this name, and the commentators are not agreed as to which of them is here intended. Keil and Bahr identify it with the Aphek hard by Shunem (1 Samuels 29:1; cf. 28:4), and therefore in the plain of Esdraelon, while Gesenius and Grove the latter because of its connection with הַמִּישׁור the plain, a word applied, κατ ἐξοχὴν to the plain in the tribe of Reuben (Deuteronomy 3:10; Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 13:9, 16, 17, 21, etc.) - would see in it the Aphek east of the Jordan, the Apheca of Eusebius, and perhaps the place mentioned 2 Kings 13:17 (where, however, see note). This trans-Jordanic Aphek is new represented by the village of Fik, six miles east of the sea of Galilee, and standing, as Aphek must have then stood, on the high road between Damascus and Jerusalem. On the whole, the balance of probability inclines to the latter. It would follow hence that the Israelites, emboldened by their victory of the preceding year, had crossed the river to meet the enemy], to fight against Israel.

Hith-pael], and were all present [Rather, and were provided with food, כּוּל = to nourish. The Alex. LXX. inserts καὶ διοικήθησαν. Vulgate accepetis cibariis. Marg. were victualled. This word of itself suggests that they were at a distance from their capital or other city], and went against them [Heb. to meet them]: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks חֲשִׂיפstrictly means separate& It is rightly translated \"little flocks\" (not \"flocks,\" Rawlinson ), because the idea is that of two bands of stragglers separated from the main body of the flock. So the Vulgate, duo parvi greges caprarum; but LXX., δύο ποίμνια άγὧν. Ewald thinks the \"two flocks\" points to an an auxiliary fores furnished by Jehoshaphat, fighting with Israel. He also thinks goats are mentioned to convey the exalted position of the camp upon the hills. Flocks of goats as a rule are smaller than those of sheep, the former being more given to straying] of kids [lit., she-goats. \"These flocks pasture mostly on the cliffs, and are smaller than the flocks of sheep\" (Bahr)]; but the Syrians filled the country. [The whole plain swarmed with their legions in striking contrast to the two insignificant Bodies of Israelites.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And there came a man of God [Whether this is the same person as the \"prophet\" of vers. 13, 22, is not quite clear. The difference in the designation (see on 1 Kings 13:1 and p. 303) would lead us to suppose that a different messenger was meant. It is true the Hebrew has the article \"the man of God\" (LXX. ὁ ἄνθρωπος τοῦ θεοῦ), but אִיּשׁ הֶךאלהִים (see Judges 13:6; Deuteronomy 33:1) is often hardly distinguishable from the same words without the article], and spake [Heb. said, same word as below] unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Because the Syrians [Heb. Syria, but with a plural verb] have said, The Lord is Cod of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. [It was partly for the instruction of Israel, and to confirm their wavering faith in Jehovah (see ver. 13), that this deliverance was wrought. But it was also that neighbouring nations might learn His power, and that His name might be magnified among the heathen.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And they pitched one over against the other [Heb. these opposite these] seven days. [The Syrians, despite their overwhelming numbers, appear to have been afraid to attack, and the Israelites were naturally reluctant, despite the promise they had received, to join battle with so great a host]. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was Joined [Heb. the war drew near. It may have been by the direction of the man of God that the Israelites attacked on the seventh day, or the precedent of Jericho (Joshua 6:15) may have influenced their leaders; or the number seven, properly the mark and signature of the covenant, may have come to be regarded superstitiously - in fact, as a lucky number (cf. Isaiah 65:11; Esther 3:7]: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. [This prodigious slaughter may well create surprise. That two comparatively small companies should be able, physically, to slay, with the rude weapons of that age, 100,000 warriors, fighting for their lives, seems hardly credible. It is probable, therefore, that the numbers here, as elsewhere, have been exaggerated in the course of transcription. Another explanation of the difficulty has, indeed, been suggested by Bahr, viz., that וַיַּכּוּ may signify here, as it undoubtedly does elsewhere, \"defeated,\" \"put to flight\" (see Genesis 14:5; 1 Samuel 13:4, etc.) And the Hebrew at first sight seems to favour this idea, for it may be rendered literally, they smote Syria, a hundred thousand, etc. The 100,000 would then represent the entire strength of the Syrian infantry. But the mention of the \"footmen\" and of \"one day\" alike suggests that it is of slaughter, not dispersion, that the historian speaks.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - But the rest [Plainly those not claim It cannot mean those not defeated] fled to Aphek [It is clear that this fortress was then in the possession of the Syrians, as they took refuge within its walls], into the city; and there a wall [Heb. the wall, i.e., the city wall] fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. [The Hebrew implies that these were practically all who survived the battle, הַנּותָרִים is the word translated above, \"the rest.\" We have here surely an exaggeration, even more obvious than that of ver. 39. For even if we suppose an earthquake, it is difficult to believe that the walls of a place like Aphek could bury so large a number in their ruins. Rawlinson suggests that the Syrians at the time were \"manning the defences in full force,\" and that the earthquake \"threw down the wall where they were most thickly crowded upon it;\" but the question arises whether it is possible to mass 27,000 men upon any part of a wall, or all the walls, especially of an ancient village fortress. Thenius hints that the fall of the wall may have been occasioned by the Israelites undermining it during the night, but it seems hardly likely that so small a force could undertake operations of that kind against so formidable a body of troops. Keil objects to this view on another ground, viz., that its object is to negative the idea of a Divine interposition. But the text does not ascribe the fall of the wall to any such interposition, and we know that the sacred writers are not slow to recognize the finger of God whenever it is exerted.] And Ben-hadad fled, and came into [Heb. to] the city [i.e., Aphek. Rawlinson interprets this statement to mean that he \"fled from the wall, where he had been at the time of the disaster, into the inner parts of the city,\" but this is extremely doubtful. Observe the words, \"fled and cane to the city\" - words almost identical with those used of the fugitives above], into an inner chamber. [Heb. into a chamber within a chamber, as in 1 Kings 22:25. This cannot mean from chamber to chamber,\" as marg. It is to be observed that חֶדֶר alone signifies properly an inner chamber. See Genesis 43:30; Judges 16:9, 12. Rawlinson thinks that a secret chamber may be meant \"a chamber in the wall, or one beneath the floor of another.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And his servants [Possibly the very same men who (ver. 23) had counselled this second expedition] said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings [As no doubt they were when compared with contemporary pagan sovereigns]: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins [in token of humiliation and contrition, שַׂק is identical, radically, with σάκκος, saccus, and our sack], and ropes upon our heads [i.e., round our necks. To show how completely they were at Ahab's mercy. Bahr shows that this custom still exists in China but the well-known story of the citizens of Calais, after its siege by Edward III., supplies a closer illustration], and go out [Heb. go] to the king of Israel [It would appear from the language of ver. 33 am if Ahab's army was now besieging the place.

Cf. Genesis 44:15; Leviticus 19:26; 2 Kings 17:17. LXX. οἰωνίσαντο. Vulgate acceperunt pro omine - and hasted and made him declare whether from him, the meaning of which is sufficiently clear, viz., that the men took Ahab's words,\"He is my brother,\" as a speech of good omen, and immediately laid hold of it, and contrived that the king should be held to it and made to confirm it. The only difficulty is in the word וַיַּחְלְטוּ which is ἄπαξ My. The Talmud, however, interprets it to mean, declare, confirm; in the Kal conjugation and the Hiphil would therefore mean, made him declare. The LXX. and Vulgate, however, have understood it otherwise, taking חָלַט as the equivalent of חָלָץ rapuit. The former has ἀνελέξαντο τὸν λόγον ἐκ τοῦ οτόματος αὐτοῦ, and the latter rapuerunt `. They would seem also to have read instead of הַדָּבָר מ חֲמֵמֶּנוּ (Ewald). The law of dakheet (see Layard, N. and B. pp. 317-319), by which Rawlinson would explain this incident, seems to be rather an usage of the Bedouin than of any civilized nations]: and they said, Thy brother Ben-hadad. Then said he, Go ye, bring him.- Then Ben-hadad came forth to him [out of his hiding-place and out of the city]: and he caused him to come up into the chariot. [A mark of great favour (compare Genesis 41:43), and of reconciliation and concord (cf. 2 Kings 10:15).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - And Ben-hadad said unto him The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore [We can hardly see in these words \"the terms of peace which he is willing to offer as the price of his freedom\" (Rawlinson), because he was absolutely at Ahab's mercy, and was not in a position to make any stipulations; but they express Ben-hadad's idea of the results which must follow the conquest. His utter defeat would necessitate this reconstruction of their respective territories, etc. We cannot be quite certain that the cities here referred to are those enumerated in 1 Kings 15:20, as taken by Ben-hadad's armies from Baasha. For Baasha was not the father, nor even was he the \"ancestor\" (as Keil, later edition) of Ahab, but belonged to a different dynasty. At the same time it is quite conceivable that a prince in Ben-hadad's position, in his ignorance or forgetfulness of the history of Israel, might use the word \"father\" improperly, or even in the sense of \"predecessor.\" We know that אָב had a very extended signification.] Keil and Bahr, however, think that we have a reference to some war in the reign of Omri (cf. 1 Kings 16:27), which is not recorded in Scripture. And the words which follow make this extremely probable, inasmuch as in Baasha's days Samaria had no existence] ? and thou shalt make streets [חצות lit., whatever is without; hence streets, spaces, quarters] for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. [The commentators are agreed that a permission to establish bazaars or quarters, in which the Hebrews might live and trade, is here conceded]. Then said Ahab [These words are rightly supplied by our translators. The meaning would have been quite clear had the Hebrews been familiar with the use of quotation marks. For lack of these, all the versions ascribe the words to Ben-hadad], I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And a certain man [Heb. one man; cf. 1 Kings 13:11, note] of the sons of the prophets [Here mentioned for the first time, though the prophetic schools probably owed their existence, certainly their development, to Samuel. The בּנֵי הָנּ are of course not the children, but the pupils of the prophets. For this use of \"son,\" cf. 1 Samuel 20:31 (\"a son of death\"); 2 Samuel 12:5; Deuteronomy 25:2; Matthew 23:15; 1 Kings 4:30; Ezra 2:1; John 17:12, and Amos 7:14. Gesenius refers to the Greek ἱατρῶν υἱοί ῤητόρων υἱοί, etc., and says that among the Persians \"the disciples of the Magi are called, \"Sons of Magi.\" The word, again, does not necessarily imply youth. That they were sometimes married men appears from 2 Kings 6:1, though this was probably after their collegiate life was ended. As they were called \"sons,\" so their instructor, or head, was called \"father\" (1 Samuel 10:12)] said unto his neighbour [or companion. Another prophet is implied. It was because this \"neighbour\" was a prophet that his disregard of the word of the Lord was so sinful, and received such severe punishment], in the word of the Lord [see on 1 Kings 13:1], Smite me, I pray thee. [Why the prophet, in order to the accomplishment of his mission - which was to obtain from Ahab's own lips a confession of his deserts - why he should have been smitten, i.e., bruised and wounded, is not quite clear. For it is obvious that he might have sustained his part, told his story, and obtained a judgment from the king, without proceeding to such painful extremities. It is quite true that a person thus wounded would perhaps sustain the part of one who had been in battle better, but the wounds were in no way necessary to his disguise, and men do not court pain without imperious reasons. Besides, it was \"in the word of the Lord\" that these wounds were sought and received. It is quite clear, therefore, that it cannot have been merely to give him a claim to an audience with the king (Ewald) - he could easily have simulated wounds by means of bandages, which would at the same time have helped to disguise him - or that he might foreshadow in his own person the wounding which Ahab would receive (1 Kings 22:11), for of that he says nothing, or for any similar reason. The wounding, we may be quite sure, and the tragical circumstances connected therewith, are essential parts of the parable this prophet had to act, of the lesson he had to teach. 1%w the great lesson he had to convey, not to the king alone, but to the prophetic order and to the whole country, the lesson most necessary in that lawless age, was that of implicit unquestioning obedience to the Divine law. Ahab had just transgressed that law. He had \"let go a man whom God had appointed to utter destruction;\" he had heaped honours on the oppressor of his country, and in gratifying benevolent impulses had ignored the will and counsel of God (see on ver. 42). No doubt it seemed to him, as it has seemed to others since, that he had acted with rare magnanimity, and that his generosity in that age, an age which showed no mercy to the fallen, was unexampled. But he must be taught that he has no right to be generous at the expense of others; that God's will must be done even when it goes against the grain, when it contradicts impulses of kindness, and demands painful sacrifices. He is taught this by the prophetic word (ver. 42), but much more effectively by the actions which preceded it. A prophet required to smite a brother prophet, and that for no apparent reason, would no doubt find it repugnant to his feelings to do so; it would seem to him hard and cruel and shameful to smite a companion. But the prophet who refused to do this, who followed his benevolent impulses in preference to the word of the Lord, died for his sin - died forthwith by the visitation of God. What a lesson was this to king and country - for no doubt the incident would be bruited abroad, and the very strangeness of the whole proceeding would heighten the impression it made. Indeed, it is hardly possible to conceive a way in which the duty of unquestioning obedience could be more emphatically taught. When this prophet appeared before the king, a man had smitten and wounded him, disagreeable and painful as the task must have been, because of the word of the Lord; whilst a brother prophet, who declined the office because it was painful, had been slain by a wild beast. It is easy to see that there was here a solemn lesson for the king, and that the wounding gave it its edge.] And the man refused to smite him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.

And as soon as he was departed from him, a [Heb. the] lion found him [same word as in 1 Kings 13:24, where see note], and slew him [For the same sin as that of \"the man of God (1 Kings 13:21, 26), viz., disobedience (Deuteronomy 32:24; Jeremiah 5:6), and disobedience, too, under circumstances remarkably similar to those. In fact, the two histories run on almost parallel lines. In each case it is a prophet who disobeys, and disobeys the \"word of the Lord;\" in each case the disobedience appears almost excusable; in each case the prophet appears to be hardly dealt with, and suffers instant punishment, whilst the king escapes; in each case the punishment is foretold by a prophet; in each case it is effected by the instrumentality of a lion. And in each case the lesson is the same - that God's commands must be kept, whatever the cost, or that stern retribution will inevitably follow.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.

And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him [Heb. smiting and wounding.

Probably he had the fate of the other before his eyes.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

Ashes cannot be put on the eyes, and even on the head would be but a poor disguise.

It would almost seem as if this prophet was personally known to the king.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king [in his capacity of supreme judge; see on 1 Kings 3:9]: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle [i.e., the recent battle]; and, behold, a man turned aside [סָר; cf. 1 Kings 22:43; Exodus 3:3; Exodus 32:8.

This is an in direct proof that those were the words of Ahab] out of thy hand [Heb. out of hand - same idiom in 1 Samuel 26:23 - i.e., power, possession. Cf. Genesis 32:12; Exodus 18:9; Numbers 35:25] a man whom I appointed to utter destruction [Heb. a man of my devoting. Cf. Isaiah 34:5; Zechariah 14:11. It is the word used of the Canaanites and their cities, Deuteronomy 2:34; Deuteronomy 7:2; Joshua 8:26; Joshua 10:28; and it gave a name to the city Hormah, Numbers 21:3; Numbers 14:45. Ben-hadad, therefore, was doomed of God], therefore thy life shall go for [Heb. be instead of] his life, and thy people for his people. [By the lex talionis. It was probably because of this denunciation (cf. 1 Kings 22:8) that Josephus identifies this prophet with Micaiah, the son of Imlah, \"whom Ahab appears to have imprisoned on account of some threatening prophecy (Rawlinson). See 1 Kings 22:9, 26. For the fulfilment o! this prediction see ch. 22. It has seemed to some writers as if Ahab were here very hardly dealt with for merely gratifying s generous impulse, and dealing magnanimously with a conquered foe. Indeed, there are commentators who see in his release of the cruel and insolent tyrant s \"trait which does honour to the heart of Ahab.\" But it is to be remembered, first, that Ahab was not free to do as he liked in this matter. His victories had been won, not by his prowess, by the skill of his generals, or the valour of his soldiers, but by the power of God alone. The war, that is to say, was God's war: it was begun and continued, and should therefore have been ended, in Him. When even the details of the attack had been ordered of God (ver. 14), surely He should have been consulted as to the disposal of the prisoners. The prophet who promised Divine aid might at any rate have been asked - as prophets constantly were in that age (1 Kings 22:5, 8) - what was the \"word of the Lord\" concerning Israel's overbearing and inveterate enemy. But Ahab, who had himself played so craven a part (vers. 21, 31), and who had contributed nothing to these great and unhoped-for victories, nevertheless arrogated to himself their fruits, and thereby ignored and dishonoured God. Secondly, if he had so little regard for his own private interests as to liberate such a man as Ben-hadad, he ought, as trustee for the peace and welfare of Israel, to have acted differently. The demand of ver. 6 should have revealed to him the character of the man he had to deal with. And lastly, he was acting in defiance of all the principles and precedents of the Old Testament dispensation. For one great principle of that dispensation was the lex talionis. The king was the authorized dispenser of rewards and punishments, not only to wicked subjects but to aggressive nations. It was his duty to mete out to them the measure they had served to Israel. And the precedents were all in favour of putting such wretches as this Ben-hadad to the sword (Joshua 10:26; Judges 7:25; 1 Samuel 15:33). If he had been the first oppressor who fell into the hands of Israel, Ahab might have had some excuse. But with the fate of Agog, of Adonibezek, of Oreb and Zeeb, in his memory, he ought at any rate to have paused and asked counsel of God before taking Ben-hadad into his chariot and sending him away with a covenant of peace, to reappear at no distant period on the scene as the scourge of the Lord's people.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings20:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased [Heb. sullen and angry; same words 1 Kings 21:4], and came to Samaria.

[It is clear from these last words that Jezreel had not replaced Samaria as the capital. It was a \"palace\" only that Ahab had there.

These words reveal to us, first, that Naboth was a worshipper of the Lord - otherwise he would hardly have used the sacred name, and that to Ahab, with whom the servants of the true God had found but scant favour; and, secondly, that he looked upon the alienation of his patrimony as an act displeasing to the Lord, and as violating the law of Moses (Leviticus 25:23 sqq.; Numbers 36:7 sqq.)

It rather shows that so little did he meditate evil that he accepted the refusal of Naboth as conclusive, and gave way to childish grief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad [same word as in ver. 4], that thou eatest no bread?

Dost thou now govern [Heb. make; LXX: ποιεῖς [βασιλέα] the kingdom of Israel?

Some of the Egyptian signets are more than 4,000 years old. Their use in the age of the patriarchs is attested by Genesis 38:15 and Genesis 41:42; their importance is proved by the text, by Esther 3:10; Esther 8:2, 8, 10 (cf. \"Herod,\" 3:128); Daniel 6:17; Jeremiah 32:10, 54; Haggai 2:23, etc. Whether this seal - which does not necessarily prove that those who used it could not write - was impressed upon the writings themselves according to the modern practice of the East, or upon a piece of clay (Job 38:14), which was then attached to the letter by strings, we have no means of knowing. The use of Ahab's seal affords a strong presumption that he was privy to her designs (Bahr), but of this we cannot be absolutely certain], and sent the letters unto the elders [see Deuteronomy 16:18] and to the nobles [same word Nehemiah 2:16; Nehemiah 4:13; Ecclesiastes 10:17] that were in his city, dwelling [or inhabitants, as in ver. 11] with Naboth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And she wrote in the letters, saying Proclaim a fast [The object of this ordinance was to give the impression that the city was labouring under, or threatened with, a curse, because of some undiscovered sin (2 Samuel 21:1; Joshua 9:11; Deuteronomy 21:9), which must be removed or averted by public humiliation.

But \"at the head of the people \"rather suggests that in the public assembly, which marked the fast (Joel 2:15), Naboth was assigned the most distinguished place. The reason for this is obvious, viz., to give a colour of impartiality to the proceedings. As Grotius, Ne odio damnasse crederentur, quem ipsi honoraverunt. It would also accord with the popular idea of retributive justice that Naboth should be denounced in the very hour of his triumph and exaltation.

Josephus speaks of three witnesses], sons of Belial [i.e., worthless men. This use of the word \"son\" (cf. Psalm 89:22, \"son of wickedness\"), which is one of the commonest idioms of the East, throws some light on the expression \"sons of the prophets\" (see 1 Kings 20:35, note; cf. Deuteronomy 13:13; Matthew 26:60)], before him [confronting him], to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme [Heb. bless; cf. Job 1:5, 11; Job 2:5; LXX. εὐλόγησε. The Lexicographers are not agreed as to how this word, the primary meaning of which is to kneel, hence to pray, to bless, came to signify curse or blaspheme. According to some, it is an euphemism, the idea of cursing God being altogether too horrible for the Jew to express in words; whilst others derive this signification from the fact that a curse is really a prayer addressed to God; and others, again, account for it by the consideration that a person who bids farewell to another sometimes does so in the sense of dismissing and cursing him. Anyhow, it is noticeable that the word \"blessing\" is sometimes used with a similar meaning amongst ourselves] God and the king [God and the representative of God in Israel are here coupled together, as in Exodus 22:28. To curse the king was practically to curse Him whose vicegerent he was (cf. Matthew 23:18-22). Hence such cursing is called blasphemy and was punishable with death (Deuteronomy 13:11; Deuteronomy 17:5; 2 Samuel 16:9; 2 Samuel 19:21; and see on 1 Kings 2:43, 44)].

Sanh.)], and stone him [the legal punishment for blasphemy (Leviticus 24:16)], that he may die. [The terrible power accorded to \"two or three witnesses,\" of denouncing a man to death, accounts for the prominence given to the sin of bearing false witness (Exodus 20:16; Exodus 23:1; Deuteronomy 19:16).

And if it be objectedNEWLINENEWLINE(3) that our historian sees in the death of Ahab in Samaria (ch. 20. l.c.) a fulfilment of this prophecy, the answer is that that death was a partial fulfilment of Elijah's words. The repentance of Ahab, having secured him immunity from this sentence, his subsequent folly and sin (cf. 1 Kings 22:27) nevertheless brought down upon him a judgment of God strikingly similar, as we might expect it would be, to that originally denounced against him, which was now reserved for his son. In ether words, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter in the person of his son, but it had a secondary fulfilment in its spirit on himself].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?

Ahab is so conscience stricken by the sudden apparition of Elijah, whom in all probability he had not seen or heard of since \"the day of Carmel,\" and by his appearance on the scene at the very moment when he was entering on the fruit of his misdoing,\" in the very blossom of his sin,\" that he feels that judgment is already begun], O mine enemy? [No doubt the thought was present in Ahab's mind that Elijah had ever been opposed to him and thwarting him, but he does not dream (Von Gerlach, in Bahr) of justifying himself by ascribing Elijah's intervention to personal hatred towards himself. The sequel shows that he was thoroughly conscious of wrong-doing.] And he answered, I have found thee: because [not because I am thine enemy, but because] thou has sold thyself [or sellest thyself, i.e., surrenderest thyself wholly. The idea is clearly derived from the institutions of slavery, according to which the bondservant was wholly at his master's disposal and was bound to accomplish his will. Whether \"the practice of men selling themselves into slavery\" (Rawlinson) existed in that age may perhaps be doubted. We have the same thought in 2 Kings 17:17, and Romans 7:14] to work evil in the sight of the Lord. [We can readily gather from these words why the doom was denounced against Ahab, who had but a secondary share in the crime, rather than against Jezebel, its real perpetrator. It was because Ahab was the representative of God, God's minister of justice, etc. If he had not himself devised the death of Naboth; if he had, which is possible, remained in ignorance of the means by which Jezebel proposed to procure him the vineyard, he had nevertheless readily and gladly acquiesced in her infamous crime after its accomplishment, and was then reaping its fruits. And because he was the king, the judge, who, instead of punishing the evil doer, sanctioned and approved the deed, and who crowned a reign of idolatries and abominations with this shameful murder, the prophetic sentence is directed primarily against him.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity [Heb. exterminate after thee.

Rawlinson conjectures that it was during this period that the Assyrian invasion, under Shalmaneser II., took place. The Black Obelisk tells us that Ahab of Jezreel joined a league of kings, of whom Ben-hadad was one, against the Assyrians, furnishing a force of 10,000 footmen and 2000 chariots; see \"Hist.

[For aught that appears, this was the first time that the monarchs of the sister kingdoms had met, except in battle, since the disruption, though the marriage of Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, with Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, had taken place some years before this date (2 Chronicles 18:1, 2). It is probable that it was the growing power of Syria had led to this affinity and alliance.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the king of Israel said unto his servants [During the visit. It seems likely that Jehoshaphat went down to Samaria by Ahab's invitation, and that the latter then had this campaign in view. The chronicler says that Ahab \"incited,\" or \"stirred him up\" (same word as in 1 Kings 21:25) to go with him to battle. Ahab was unable to contend single-handed, and without Divine assistance - which he could not now look for - against Syria; and saw no means of compelling the execution of the treaty which Ben-hadad had made with him (1 Kings 20:34), and which he appears to have shamelessly broken, except by the help of Jehoshaphat, whose military organizetion at this time must have been great, and, indeed, complete (2 Chronicles 17:10-19). It is in favour of this view that Ahab entertained him and his large retinue with such profuse hospitality. The chronicler, who dwells on the number of sheep and oxen slain for the feast, intimates that it was this generous reception \"persuaded\" Jehoshaphat to join in the war], Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead [Generally, as below (vers. 4, 6, etc.), \"Ramoth-Gilead,\" i.e., of Gilead.

This \"great frontier fortress was, in the hands of Syria, even after many reverses, a constant menace against Israel\" (Stanley)] is ours [i.e., it was one of the cities which Ben-hadad had promised to restore (1 Kings 20:34).

Though so long a time had elapsed, it was still in his hands], and we be still [חָשָׁה is onomatopoetic, like our \"hush.\" Marg. rightly, silent from taking it. The word conveys very expressively that they had been afraid of making any movement to assert their rights, lest they should attract the attention and anger of their powerful and incensed neighbour], and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? [It is hardly likely that Ahab could have forgotten the warning of 1 Kings 20:42. It is probable that Ben-hadad's flagrant disregard of his treaty engagements determined him to run all risks, especially if he could secure the help of the then powerful king of Judah.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?

[It is probable this question was asked with some misgivings. Such an alliance was altogether new, and Ahab might well wonder how the idea would strike a pious prince like Jehoshaphat. That the latter ought to have refused his help, we know from 2 Chronicles 19:2.] And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art [Heb. as I as thou], my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. [From the ready and unreserved way in which he at once engages in this war, we may safely conclude that he, too, had reason to fear the power of Syria. Probably Ben-hadad, when he besieged Samaria (1 Kings 20:1), had formed the idea of reducing the whole of Palestine to subjection. And Jehoshaphat would remember that Ramoth-Gilead, where the Syrian king was still entrenched, was but forty miles distant from Jerusalem. Bahr holds that horses are specially mentioned \"because they formed an essential part of the military power\" (Psalm 33:16, 17; Proverbs 21:31). It is true that in a campaign against the Syrians they would be especially useful (see on 1 Kings 20:1.); but they receive no mention at the hands of the chronicler, who reads instead of this last clause, \"And we (or I) will be with thee in the war.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at [This word is redundant] the word of the Lord today. [כַּיום hardly conveys that \"he asks to have the prophets called in at once,\" \"lest Ahab should consent in word and put off the inquiry in act\" (Rawlinson); but rather means, \"at this crisis,\" \"under these circumstances.\" This request agrees well with what we learn elsewhere as to Jehoshaphat's piety (2 Chronicles 17:4-9; 2 Chronicles 19:5-7, etc.) And, remembering how Ahab's late victories had been foretold by a prophet, and had been won by the help of Jehovah, Jehoshaphat might well suppose that his new ally would be eager to know the word of the Lord.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

The only conclusion open to us, consequently - and it is now generally adopted - is that they were the priests of the high places of Bethel and Dan, the successors of those whom Jeroboam had introduced into the priestly office. It need cause us no surprise to find these priests here described as \"prophets\" (cf. Jeremiah 22:13; Ezekiel 13:1), and as claiming prophetic gifts, for the priests of Baal bore the same name (1 Kings 18:19, 22, etc.), and apparently pretended to similar powers. \"No ancient people considered any cultus complete without a class of men through whom the god might be questioned\" (Bahr). The existence of so large a number of prophets of the calves proves that the inroads of idolatry had by no means destroyed the calf worship.

Compare Michael, \"Who is like God?\"] the son of Imiah [The chronicler writes the name Imla, יִמְלָא], by whom we may inquire of the Lord [Ahab evidently had wished Jehoshaphat to understand that the prophets already consulted were prophets of Jehovah, as no doubt they claimed to be.

Ahab insinuates that Micaiah is actuated by personal dislike. The commentators refer to Homer. I1. 4, 106-108.] And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

Deuteronomy 23:1 suggests that even such a king as Ahab would hardly inflict this humiliation upon an Israelite. From 1 Chronicles 28:1, Hebrews, we gather that even David's court had its eunuchs, and we may be sure that Solomon's enormous harem could not be maintained without them. In later days we find them prominent in the history, and occupying important positions under the king (2 Kings 8:6; 2 Kings 9:32; 2 Kings 23:11; 2 Kings 25:19; Jeremiah 29:2; Jeremiah 34:19; Jeremiah 52:25, etc. Cf.

This gathering of prophets and counsellors seems to have followed the banquet.

But the reference is clearly to the horns of a bullock, and the appropriateness of the prophetic act is only manifest when we remember that Ephraim is compared to a bullock (Deuteronomy 33:17), and more, that Moses spake beforehand of the strength of his horns, and predicted that with them he should \"push the people together to the ends of the earth.\" Not only, that is to say, was the horn a familiar Oriental symbol of power (1 Samuel 2:1, 10; 2 Samuel 22:3; Psalm 89:24; Psalm 92:10; Daniel 7:21; Daniel 8:8, etc.), but it was identified in a peculiar manner with the powerful tribe of Ephraim; in ether words, with the kingdom of Israel This symbolical act was not necessarily an imitation of the action of Ahijah (1 Kings 11:30).

[We are forcibly reminded of the answer of Balaam, Numbers 22:18, 38. And we may see not only in the suggestion of this messenger, but also in Ahab's belief (ver. 8), that Micaiah could prophesy at pleasure, a striking correspondence with the ideas of Balak (ib. 5:6, 17). Instead of regarding the prophet as being merely the mouthpiece of Deity, he was believed in that age to have a supernatural influence with God, and to be entrusted with magical powers to shape the future, as well as to foretell it.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? [Same words as in ver. 6. There is an apparent studied fairness in this repetition. It is as if Ahab said, \"Despite his prejudice against me, I will not attempt to influence his mind. I only deal with him as with the rest.\"] And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king. [As Ahab's inquiry is the echo of the question of ver. 6, so is Micaiah's response identical with the answer of the prophets. He simply echoes their words, of which, perhaps, he has been informed by the eunuch. There was an exquisite propriety in this. The question was insincere; the reply was ironical (cf. 1 Kings 18:27). Ahab is answered \"according to the multitude of his idols\" (Ezekiel 14:4). He wishes to be deceived, and he is deceived. No doubt Micaiah's mocking tone showed that his words were ironical; but Ahab's hollow tone had already proved to Micaiah that he was insincere; that he did not care to know the will of the Lord, and wanted prophets who would speak to him smooth things and prophesy deceits (Isaiah 30:10).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And the king said unto him How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord? [Rawlinson concludes from these words that \"this mocking manner was familiar to Micaiah, who had used it in some former dealing with the Israelite monarch.\" But we must remember that Ahab's words were really addressed to Jehoshaphat. He is so manifestly playing a part, that we need not assume that he is strictly truthful. His great desire evidently is to discredit Micah's predictions, which he clearly perceives, from the bitter and ironical tone of the latter, will be adverse to him.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And he said [We may imagine how entire was the change of tone. He now speaks with profound seriousness. Thenius sees in the peculiarity and originality of this vision a proof of the historical truth of this history. \"We feel that we are gradually drawing nearer to the times of the later prophets. It is a vision which might rank amongst those of Isaiah or Ezekiel\" (Stanley)], I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. [The last words are illustrated by the command of ver. 31; compare ver. 36. We may also picture the effect these words would have on the assembly at the city gate. For, however much they might be inclined to discredit Micaiah's words, and however much the reckless, unreasoning war spirit might possess them, there were none who did not understand that this vision portended the dispersion of the Israelite army and the death of its leader. King and people had been constantly represented under the figure of shepherd and sheep, and notably by Moses himself, who had used these very words, \"sheep without a shepherd\" (Numbers 27:17; cf. Psalm 78:70, 71; Isaiah 44:28; Jeremiah 23:1, 2; Ezekiel 34, passim. It is observable that Micaiah's vision, like Zedekiah's parable, borrows the language of the Pentateuch. Coincidences of this remote character are the most powerful proofs that the Pentateuch was then written.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would [Heb. say to thee, He will, etc.] prophesy no good concerning me but evil? [It is clear that Ahab had understood perfectly the purport of Micaiah's words. He now appeals to them as a proof of the latter's malice.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And he said, Hear thou [in 2 Chronicles 18:18, Hear ye] therefore [The LXX. has οὐχ οὕτως, whence it would almost appear that they had the text לא כֵּן before them (Bahr). But לָכֵן is every way to be preferred. It is emphatic by position, and the meaning is, \"Since you will have it that my words are prompted by malice, hear the message I have for you,\" etc.] the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord [It is not implied (Wordsworth) that he had any direct and objective vision of God, such as Moses (Exodus 34:5), Elijah, or St. Stephen. He here declares what he may have seen in dream or trance. (Cf. Revelation 1:10; Revelation 4:2; Isaiah 6:1; Ezekiel 1:1.) It was a real but inner vision (Keil). In its interpretation the caution of Peter Martyr is carefully to be borne in mind; Omnia haec dicuntur ἀνθρωποπαθῶς] sitting on his throne [It was natural for some of the commentators to see in these words a reference to the two kings then sitting in their royal apparel, each upon his throne. But it is very doubtful whether any such thought was present in the mind of the speaker, who, imply relates a vision of the past], and all the host of heaven [The celestial powers, cherubim, angels, archangels, who surround the Lord of glory. That there can be no reference to the sun, moon, and stars, notwithstanding that these are called \"the host of heaven\" in Deuteronomy 4:19; Deuteronomy 17:3, is clear from the next words. The expression is to be explained by Genesis 32:1, 2] standing by him [עָלָיו; for the meaning, see Genesis 18:8] on his right hand and on his left. [The resemblance of this vision to that of Isaiah (1 Kings 6:1-8) must not be overlooked.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And the Lord said, Who shall persuade [Same word in Exodus 22:16, Hebrews; Judges 14:15; Judges 16:5; Proverbs 1:10, etc.; in all of which instances it is translated \"entice.\" Compare with this question that of Isaiah 6:8.] Ahab, that he may go up and fan at Ramoth-Gilead? [The meaning is that Ahab's death in battle had been decreed in the counsels of God, and that the Divine Wisdom had devised means for accomplishing His purpose.] And one said on this manner, and another said [Heb. saying] on that manner. [Bahr again quotes from Peter Martyr: \"Innuit varies providentiae Dei modos, quibus decreta sua ad exitum perducit, and adds that in this vision \"inner and spiritual processes are regarded as real phenomena, nay, even as persons.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And there came forth a spirit [Heb. the spirit. By some, especially of the earlier commentators, understood of the evil spirit. But the view now generally adopted (Thenius, Keil, Bahr) is that \"the spirit of prophecy\" is meant, \"the power which, going forth from God and taking possession of a man, makes him a prophet (1 Samuel 10:6, 10; 1 Samuel 19:20, 23). The נָביא is the אִישׁ הָרוּחַ (Hosea 9:7)\" Bahr. This power is here personified], and stood before the Lord, and said, I [emphatic in the Hebrew] will persuade [or entice] him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?

By what?] And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit [Heb. a spirit of a lie. Cf. Zechariah 13:2; 1 John 4:6] in the mouth of all his prophets. [His prophets, not God's. Cf. 2 Kings 3:13.] And he said, Thou shalt persuade him. and prevail also: go forth, and do so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth Of all these thy [Cf. ὁ; οῖκος ὑμῶν, Matthew 23:38] prophets [This statement, especially to those who have taken the narrative literally, and who have seen in \"the spirit\" either one of the angels of God, or Satan himself, has presented almost insuperable difficulties. The main difficulty lies in the fact that the Almighty and All Holy is here made to give His sanction to deceit and lying, for the purpose of tempting Ahab to his death. We have precisely the same difficulty, though, if possible, more directly expressed in Ezekiel 14:9: \"If the prophet be deceived... I the Lord have deceived that prophet.\" Cf. Jeremiah 20:7; 1 Samuel 16:15. But this difficulty vanishes if we remember that this is euthropopathic language, and is merely meant to convey that God had \"taken the house of Israel in their own heart,\" because they were \"estranged from Him through their idols\" (Ezekiel 14:5). Ahab wished to be guided by false prophets, and the justice of God decreed that he should be guided by them to his ruin. Sin is punished by sin. \"God proves His holiness most of all by this, that He punishes evil by evil, and destroys it by itself\" (Bahr). Ahab had chosen lying instead of truth: by lying - according to the lex talionis - he should be destroyed. The difficulty, in fact, is that of the permission of evil in the world; of the use of existent evil by God to accomplish His purposes of good], and the Lord [not I alone, ver. 18] hath spoken [i.e., decreed] evil concerning thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah [Rawlinson holds that he was a sort of coryphaeus of the false prophets. It is more probable that, having put himself forward on a former occasion (ver. 11), he now feels specially aggrieved at Micaiah's blunt assertion, that he and the rest have been possessed by a spirit of lies] went near, and smote Micaiah [A thoroughly natural touch. But the whole narrative has every mark of naturalness and veracity. It is easy to see how enraged Zedekiah would be at the slight cast upon his prophetic powers. Apparently this gross indignity elicited no protest or word of displeasure from either of the kings. Micaiah, like Elijah, was left alone], on the cheek [cf. Job 16:10; Lamentations 3:30; Luke 6:29; and above all Matthew 26:67; Luke 22:64; Acts 23:2. Herein Micaiah had \"the fellowship of sufferings\" (Philippians 3:10) with our blessed Lord. Rawlinson thinks that his hands would be bound, but this is extremely improbable. In that case Ahab could hardly have asked him to prophesy (ver. 15), or if he did, Jehoshaphat would know beforehand what to expect], and said, Which way [Heb. What, or where. The chronicler supplies \"way,\" thereby bringing the expression into unison with 1 Kings 13:12; 2 Kings 3:8; Job 38:24] went [Heb. passed, crossed, עָבַר] the Spirit of the Lord [These words are important, as showing that the speaker had not identified \"the spirit\" of ver. 21 with the evil spirit: Job 1:6 sqq.] from me to speak unto thee? [It is pretty clear from these words, in connexion with ver. 23, that Zedekiah had been conscious of an inspiration, of a spirit not his own, which impelled him to speak and act as he did. We must not attach too much import-ante to a taunting and passionate speech, but its meaning appears to be: I have spoken in the name and by the spirit of Jehovah. Thou claimest to have done the same. How is it that the Spirit of God speaks one thing by me, another by thee? Thou hast seen (ver. 19) the secret counsels of Heaven. Tell us, then, which way, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see [Keil understands, \"that the Spirit of the Lord had departed from thee.\" But the meaning rather appears to be, \"Thou shalt see which was a true prophet.\" He does not answer the insolent question, but says,\" Thou wilt alter thy mind in the day,\" etc. With this may be compared our Lord's words, Matthew 26:64. He also manifests our Lord's spirit (1 Peter 2:22 sqq.) \"as if the Great Example had already appeared before him\" (Bahr)] in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber [see note on 1 Kings 20:30] to hide thyself. [When was this prediction fulfilled? Probably when the news of the defeat reached Samaria, or on the day after Ahab's death. Jezebel would almost certainly take summary vengeance upon the false prophets who were responsible for her husband's death and the reverses of the army. Or if she did not, the prophets had good reason to fear that she would, and would hide accordingly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And the king of Israel said, Take [Sing. Take thou. This command was probably addressed to the eunuch mentioned in ver. 9] Micaiah and carry him back [Heb. make him return. This shows clearly that he had come from prison] unto Amon the governor [שַׂר chief; same word in 1 Kings 4:2; 1 Kings 11:24; 1 Kings 16:9; Genesis 37:36; Genesis 40:9, 22, etc. The \"chief of the city\" is also mentioned 2 Kings 23:8; cf. Nehemiah 11:9] of the city [who would naturally have charge of the town prison. Probably the prison was in his house. Cf. Genesis 40:3; Jeremiah 37:20], and to Joash the king's son. [Thenius supposes that this prince had been entrusted to Amon for his military education, and refers to 2 Kings 10:1. But in that case he would hardly have been mentioned as associated with him in the charge of so important a prisoner. Whoever Joash was, he was a man in authority. It is curious that we find another prophet, Jeremiah, put into the prison of Malchiah, the son of the king (A.V. the son of Hammelech; same expression as here), Jeremiah 38:6; cf. 36:26. Some have seen in this designation a name of office, and Bahr thinks that \"Joash was not probably a son of Ahab, but a prince of the blood.\" But when we remember what a number of sons Ahab had (2 Kings 10:1), no valid reason can be assigned why Joash should not have been one of them. He may have been billeted upon Amon, and yet associated with him in the government of the city.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And say [Heb. thou shalt say], Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison [Heb. house of the prison. Bahr thinks that Micaiah had formerly been in arrest under Amon's charge, and now was to be committed to the prison proper. But more probably the words mean, \"put him in the prison again.\" His superadded punishment was to be in the shape of prison diet. It is probable that it was owing to the presence of Jehoshaphat that Micaiah escaped with no severer sentence], and feed him with bread of affliction [or oppression, לָחַץ pressit; cf. Exodus 3:9; Numbers 22:25; 2 Kings 6:32], and with water of affliction [Josephus (Ant. 8:15. 4) relates that after Micaiah's prediction the king was in great suspense and fear, until Zedekiah deliberately smote him, in order to show that he was powerless to avenge an injury as the man of God did (1 Kings 13:4), and therefore no true prophet. This may be an \"empty Rabbinical tradition\" (Bahr), but we may be sure that Ahab did not hear Micaiah's words unmoved. He had had such convincing proofs of the foresight and powers of the Lord's prophets that he may well have trembled, even as he put on a bold front, and sent Micaiah back to the prison house], until I come in peace. [This looks like an effort to encourage himself and those around him. But it almost betrays his misgivings. He would have them think he had no fears.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me.

And he said, Hearken, O people [Rather, O nations. Audite, populi crones, Vulgate. He appeals, so to speak, to the world], every one of you. [It is a curious circumstance that these same words are found at the beginning of the prophecy of Micah (1 Kings 1:2). The coincidence may be purely accidental, or the words may have been borrowed by the prophet, not, indeed, from our historian, but from some record, the substance of which is embodied in this history. Micah lived about a century and a half after Micaiah; about a century before the Book of Kings was given to the world.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - So the king of Israel and Jehoshapat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead to battle. [\"By the very network of evil counsel which he has woven for himself is the king of Israel led to his ruin\" (Stanley). We can hardly doubt that Jehoshaphat at least would have been well content to abandon the expedition. After the solicitude he had manifested for the sanction of one of the prophets of Jehovah, and after that the one who had been consulted had predicted the defeat of the army, the king of Judah must have had re,my misgivings. But it is not difficult to understand why, notwithstanding his fears, he did not draw back. For, in the first place, he had committed himself to the war by the rash and positive promise of ver. 4. In the next place, he was Ahab's guest, and had been sumptuously entertained by him, and it would therefore require some moral courage to extricate himself from the toils in which he was entangled. Moreover he would have subjected himself to the imputation of cowardice had he deserted his ally because of a prophecy which threatened the latter with death. The people around him, again, including perhaps his own retinue, were possessed with the spirit of battle, and treated the prophecy of Micaiah with contempt, and it would be difficult for him to swim alone against the current. It is probable, too, that he discounted the portentous words of Micaiah on account of the long. standing quarrel between him and Ahab. And, finally, we must remember that his own interests were threatened by Syria, and he may well have feared trouble from that quarter in case this war were abandoned. Rawlinson suggests that he may have conceived a personal affection for Ahab; but 2 Chronicles 19:2 affords but slender ground for this conclusion.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And the king of Israel said unto Jehoahaphat [At Ramoth-Gilead, on the eve of the battle], I will disguise himself.\" [same word 1 Kings 20:38] and enter [The margin,\" when he was to disguise himself,\" etc., is quite mistaken. The Hebrew has two infinitives; lit., to disguise oneself and enter; a construction which is frequently employed to indicate an absolute command. Cf. Genesis 17:10; Exodus 20:8; Isaiah 14:31; and see Ewald, 828 c. \"The infinitive absolute is the plainest and simplest form of the voluntative for exclamations\" (Bahr). It agrees well with the excitement under which Ahab was doubtless labouring] into the battle. [It is not necessary to suppose with Ewald, Rawlinson, el., that he had heard of Ben-hadad's command to his captain, (ver. 81). It is hardly likely that such intelligence could be brought by spies, and there would be no deserters from the Syrian army to that of the Jews. It is enough to remember that Micaiah's words, \"these have no master,\" could not fail to awaken come alarm in his bosom, especially when connected with the prophecy of 1 Kings 20:42. He will not betray his fear by keeping out of the fray - which, indeed, he could not do without abdicating one of the principal functions of the king (1 Samuel 8:20), and without exposing himself to the charge of cowardice; but under the circumstances he thinks it imprudent to take the lead of the army, as kings were wont to do (2 Samuel 1:10), in his royal robes. He hopes by his disguise to escape all clanger]: but put thou on thy robes [LXX. τὸν ἱματισμόν μου. \"My robed\" \"We can neither imagine Ahab's asking nor Jehoshaphat's consenting to such a procedure. Jehoshaphat had his own royal robes with him, as appears from ver. 10\" (Rawlinson). If this LXX. interpretation could be maintained it would lend some colour to the supposition, otherwise destitute of basis, that Ahab by this arrangement was plotting the death of Jehoshaphat in order that he might incorporate Judah into his own kingdom. It is clear, however, that Ahab then had other work on his hands, and it is doubtful whether even he was capable of such a pitch of villainy. What he means is, eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the Syrians have a personal enmity against himself (ver. 81), whereas they could have none against the king of Judah; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that Jehoshaphat's life had not been threatened as his own had. \"These words וְאַתָּה לְּבשׁ are not to be taken as a command, but simply in this sense: Thou canst put on thy royal dress, since there is no necessity for thee to take any such precautions as I have to take\" (Keil). Do they not rather mean that Jehoshaphat should be the recognized leader of the army in which Ahab would serve in a more private capacity?] And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - But the king of Syria commanded [rather, had commanded. These words are of the nature of a parenthesis. \"Now the king,\" etc. צִוָּה is so rendered in 2 Chronicles 18:30] his thirty and two captains [mentioned in 1 Kings 20:24. It does not follow, however (Wordsworth), that these very men had been spared by Ahab] that had rule over his chariots [Heb. chariotry. Another indication that the chariots were regarded as the most important arm of the Syrian service], saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. [This Orientalism, translated into Western ideas, means, \"Direct your weapons against the king.\" What Ahab had done to provoke such resentment is not quite clear. Rawlinson supposes that Ben-hadad's \"defeat and captivity were still rankling in his mind, and he wished to retaliate on Ahab the humiliation which he considered himself to have suffered.\" But it is impossible to see in Ahab's generous conduct towards him a sufficient reason for the fierce hatred which these words disclose. It is much more probable that some affront had subsequently been offered to the Syrian monarch, possibly in the shape of the reproaches which Ahab may have addressed to him on account of his retention of Ramoth-Gilead, and the gross violation of the treaty of 1 Kings 20:34. It is also possible that he hoped that the death of Ahab would terminate the war (Bahr).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.

Genesis 44:28; Judges 3:24; 2 Kings 24:3] it [Heb. he] is the king of Israel. And they turned aside [Cf. 1 Kings 20:39, same word. The Hebrew inserts עָלָיו. The chronicler reads יָסֹבוּ they surrounded him, instead of יָסֻרוּ; and the LXX. has ἐκύκλωσεν, in both places. But the Syrians can hardly have actually closed round the king, and the alteration might easily be made in the course of transcription] to fight against him [according to their instructions]: and Jehoshaphat cried out. [This cry has been very variously interpreted. According to some, it was his own name that he ejaculated, which is possible, if the command of ver. 31 was known in the allied army. According to others, it was the battle cry of Judah, which, it is said, would be familiar to the Syrians, and which would rally his own soldiers round him. The Vulgate, no doubt influenced by the words of 2 Chronicles 18:31, \"And the Lord helped him, and God moved them to depart from him,\" interprets, clamavit ad Dominum. That it was a cry for Divine help is the most probable, because it is almost an instinct, especially with a pious soul like Jehoshaphat, to cry to God in the moment of danger. That he had doubts as to whether the course he was pursuing was pleasing to God, would make him all the more ready to cry aloud for mercy the moment he found himself in peril. But it may have been merely a cry of terror. It must be carefully observed that the Scripture does not say that it was this cry led to his being recognized and spared.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived [in what way we are not told.

It was natural for some of the Rabbins to identify this archer with Naaman - the tradition is found in Josephus. But it is directly contrary to the spirit of the narrative to attempt to identify him. As it was a chance arrow, so it was by an unknown archer] drew a bow at a venture [Heb. in his simplicity, i.e., with no intention of shooting Ahab: not knowing what he was doing. That this is the meaning is clear from the use of the words in 2 Samuel 15:11], and smote the king of Israel between the Joints of the harness [The marg., joints and the breastplate, comes nearer the Hebrew. But it is clear that the rendering joints, notwithstanding that it has the support of Gesenius and others, is a mistaken one. \"In the joints\" we can understand, but \"between the joints and the coat of mail,\" gives no sense. It is obvious that הַדְּבָקִים like הַשִּׁרְיָן following, must signify, some portion of the armour, and the meaning of the verb דָבַק adhaesit, leads us to conclude that \"the hanging skirt of parallel metal plates - hence the plural\" - (Bahr) is intended. The coat of mail only covered the breast and ribs. To this a fringe of movable plates of steel was attached or fastened, hence called דְבָקִים. So Luther, Zwischen den Panzer und Hengel. One is reminded here of the Parthian arrow which wrung from Julian the Apostate the dying confession, \"Thou hast conquered, O Galilean.\" Cf. Psalm 7:13, 14]: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand [or, according to the Chethib, hands. The charioteers of Palestine, like those of Egypt and Assyria, or those of modern Russia, held a rein in each hand. Same expression 2 Kings 9:23. The meaning is \"turn round\"] and carry me Out of the host; for I am wounded, [Heb. made sick. The king probably felt his wound to be mortal, as a wound in such a part, the abdomen (cf. 2 Samuel 2:23; 2 Samuel 3:27; 2 Samuel 20:10), would be Vulgate, graviter vulneratus sum. How far an arrow in such a place could penetrate, we may gather from 2 Kings 9:24; cf. Job 16:13. And he was seemingly anxious that the army should not know it, lest would soon discover it if he remained with the host; he can fight no longer; his wound needs attention; hence this command. It is quite possible that the charioteer, in the din and confusion of battle, may not have observed that his master was wounded. The arrow had not struck any part of the armour.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And the battle increased [Heb. went up. Marg. ascended. The tide of warfare rose higher and higher. Both Keil and Bahr think that the image is taken from a swelling river and cite Isaiah 8:7. The object of this verse is to explain how it was that the king's request was not complied with] that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot [Heb. made to stand. LXX. ἠν ἐστηκώς. He was supported in his chariot by some of his servants, and maintained in an erect posture. Chariots were destitute of seats. According to Thenius and Keil, he maintained himself erect, by his own strength. But the word is passive] against the Syrians [Heb. in the face of the Syrians. נֹכַח coram. His back was not turned to them, as he had desired. The idea that he was in any way fighting against the Syrians is altogether foreign to the text. It is at first sight somewhat difficult to reconcile this statement with the direction given to the charioteer in the preceding verse, and some have been led, though without sufficient warrant, to conclude that Ahab left the field, had he wound bound up, and then returned to take his part in the battle. But the explanation is very simple. As the battle increased, it became impossible to comply with the king's desire. So thick was the fight that retreat was impossible. Hence the wounded king, who would otherwise have sunk down to the bottom of the chariot, had to be \"stayed up in the presence of the Syrians.\" This circumstance may also account for the fact that he died at even. Had it been possible to remove him and staunch his wounds, he might have lingered for some time. As it was, he bled to death. It is not clear, therefore, that \"his death was kingly\" (Kitto), or that we must concede to Ahab \"the credit of right princely fortitude on this occasion\" (Rawlinson). He would have left the host could he have done so. It was his set-rants propped up the dying man in his chariot, to encourage the army. What a picture for an artist - the king with the pallor of death spreading over his face, the anxious faces of the attendants, the pool of blood, the sun sinking to the horizon, etc.], and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound [Heb. the blood of the wound poured] into the midst [Heb. bosom; LXX. κόλπον, the hollow part, or \"well.\" The same word is used of the concave part of the altar] of the chariot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - And there went a proclamation throughout the host [Heb. And the shouting passed over in the camp. Gesenius will have it that רִנָּה must mean a \"joyful cry,\" and would see the cause of joy in the cessation of hostilities and the permission to return home] about the going down of the sun [According to the chronicler (1 Kings 18:34), it was at sunset that the king died. It seems natural, therefore, to connect this shout with his death. But the approach of night would of itself put an end to the battle. It does not appear that Israel had been utterly defeated, or had suffered great loss. But \"they had no master\"], saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country [or land].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - So the king died [The LXX. makes this to be a part of the proclamation ἕκαστος εἰς τὴν... γῆν ὅτι τέθνηκεν ὁ βασιλεύς, which involves a very slight change in the Hebrew text, כי מת המל instead of וימת המל and gives a better sense. It has already been stated that the king died. Such repetitions however are common in Hebrew, and this reading has almost the look of an emendation] and was brought [Heb. came. The A.V. is against the grammar. As \"came\" would be a strange word to use of a dead man, it is highly probable that instead of ויבזא we should read ויבואו with the LXX. καὶ ῆλθον] to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria [\"with his father,\" 1 Kings 16:28].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - And one washed the chariot in [or at; Heb. עַל] the pool of Samaria. [Nearly all Eastern cities had their tanks or pools, often outside the city gate. Jerusalem has several of these, and we read of one at Hebron (2 Samuel 14:12) and Gibeon (2 Samuel 2:13). Cf. Song of Solomon 7:4. The Hebrew word בְּרֵכָה is preserved in the modern Arabic Birkeh]; and the dogs [The LXX. has the swine and the dogs. The mention of swine is hardly likely to have been omitted, had it formed part of the original text] licked up his blood [cf. 1 Kings 21:19, note. According to Josephus, the chariot was washed \"in the fountain of Jezreel.\" The alteration would appear to have been made to avoid the difficulty occasioned by the discrepancy between the statement of the text, and that of 1 Kings 21:19], and they washed his armour [So the Chaldaic and the Syriac. But this translation is now abandoned,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) because it is contrary to the usage of the language to make זֹנות the object; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) because that word occurs in the Old Testament only in the sense of harlots (Bahr). The true meaning is that given by the LXX., καὶ αἱ πόρναι ἐλούσαντο. רָחַץdoes not require any object such as \"chariot,\" or \"corpse,\" for it is found in the sense of bathe (intrans.) in Exodus 2:5; Numbers 19:19; Ruth 3:3; 2 Kings 5:10. Bahr reminds us that harlots are elsewhere associated with dogs (Deuteronomy 23:19; Revelation 22:15). This fact is mentioned as a proof of the just judgment of God. Even if these harlots were not prostitutes devoted to the service of the Phoenician deities, whose cultus Ahab had sought to establish in Israel, still the result of his religious policy had been the spread of prostitution. It is a fine example of the lex tolionis. \"He which is filthy, let him be filthy still\"]; according unto the word of the Lord which he spake [the reference is to 1 Kings 21:19].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made [So called because it was adorned with ivory. See on ch. 11; and cf. Amos 3:15; Psalm 45:8; Song of Solomon 7:5. Rawlinson cites several passages from Greek and Latin authors to prove that ivory was anciently applied, not only to furniture, but to the doors and walls of houses], and an the cities that he built [Probably Jezreel was one, but we have no information concerning them.

[The historian now resumes for a moment the history of Judah, which has dropped out of notice since 1 Kings 15:24, where the accession of Jehoshaphat was mentioned. His reign, which is here described in the briefest possible way, occupies four chapters (17-20.) of 2 Chronicles]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.

Like Asa's, it was distinguished by internal reforms, and By signal deliverances from foreign enemies]; he turned not aside from it [as Asa was tempted to do in his old age], doing [Heb. to do] that which was right in the eyes of the Lord: nevertheless the high places were not taken away [Heb. departed not, as in 1 Kings 15:14; 2 Chronicles 15:17; 2 Kings 12:4, Hebrew; 2 Kings 14:4, Hebrew But see 2 Chronicles 18:6. The discrepancy is the exact parallel of that between 1 Kings 15:14 and 2 Chronicles 14:3; or between this latter passage and 2 Chronicles 15:17. And the explanation is the same, viz., that an effort was made to remove the high places, which was partially, and only partially, successful]; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places [cf. 1 Kings 3:2].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. [One great feature of his reign was this: that the hostility which had lasted, even if it sometimes slumbered, between the two kingdoms for seventy years, from the date of their separation to the time of Asa's death, gave way to peace and even alliance. Judah now recognized the division of the kingdom as an accomplished fact, and no longer treated Israel, even theoretically, as in rebellion. It is probable that the marriage of Jehoram and Athaliah was at once the fruit of, and was intended to cement, this good understanding (2 Chronicles 18:1). It is hardly likely (Bahr) that the peace was the result of the union of the two families. From the analogy of 2 Chronicles 19:2; 2 Chronicles 20:37; cf. 1 Kings 16:31; 2 Kings 3:14, we should conclude that the marriage at any rate was ill advised and displeasing to God. Bahr sees in it a step on the part of Jehoshaphat towards realizing the union of the two kingdoms under the supremacy of Judah. He thinks that we cannot otherwise account for this complete change of front.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might [as in 1 Kings 15:23; 1 Kings 16:27, etc. It is noticeable that this word is not used of Ahab, notwithstanding his wars and victories] that he showed [see 2 Kings 3:9 sqq.; 2 Chronicles 17:12 sqq.

[This fact is mentioned to show how it was that Jehoshaphat was able to build a fleet at Ezion-Geber, in the territory of Edom (1 Kings 9:26). That country would seem to have regained its independence very soon after Solomon's death (1 Kings 11:14), but would also appear from the text, and from 2 Kings 8:20, 22, to have been again made subject to Judah, probably by Jehoshaphat himself; see 2 Chronicles 17:10, 11.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Jehoshaphat made [The Chethib has עשר ten, obviously a clerical error for עשה made] ships of Tharshish [see note on 1 Kings 10:22] to go to Ophir [In 2 Chronicles 20:36, Tharshish is read for Ophir. Wordsworth holds that two separate fleets are intended, but this is most improbable] for gold [Evidently the great prosperity of his reign had suggested to him the idea of emulating Solomon's naval exploits, and of reviving the commerce of his people with the East]: but they went not [Heb. it went not]: for the ships were broken [Probably they were dashed by a storm against the rocks which \"lie in jagged ranges on each side,\" Stanley] at Ezion-Geber.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships.

[But we are told in 2 Chronicles 20:37 that the ships were broken, according to a prophecy of Eliezer, the son of Dodavah, because Jehoshaphat had joined himself with Ahaziah. The explanation is that the fleet had been built by the two kings conjointly, and manned by the subjects of Jehoshaphat exclusively; and that, after the disaster, Ahaziah proposed either to repair the injured vessels, or to construct a second fleet, which should then be partly manned by sailors of the northern kingdom, \"men probably accustomed to the sea, perhaps trained at Tyre\" (Rawlinson). This proposal was declined by the king of Judah, not so much on account of the \"reflection on his subjects' skill contained in it,\" as because of the prophecy of Eliezer, and the evidently judicial disaster which had befallen the fleet already built.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead [2 Chronicles 21.] Reign of Ahaziah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings22:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAhaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.

The words sound like a reminiscence of Joshua 23, 24. Perhaps, too, the thought of Joshua suggested to his mind the next words]: but be thou strong, and be a man. [Similar, though not identical, words were four times addressed to Joshua (Joshua 1:6, 7, 9, 18), and David may well have thought that his son, in entering upon his difficult duties, was not at all unlike Joshua when he succeeded Moses in the leadership of Israel, and that he needed similar encouragement. It is not necessary to suppose, as Canon Rawlinson does (\"Speaker's Com.,\" vol. 2 p. 489), that in the words, \"show thyself a man,\" we have a reference to Solomon's youth; for words precisely similar were addressed to each other by the Philistines at Aphek (1 Samuel 4:9). The age of Solomon at his accession is very doubtful. David said, \"Solomon my son is young and tender\" (1 Chronicles 22:5; 1 Chronicles 29:1); and Solomon says of himself, \"I am a little child\" נַעַר קָטֹן (1 Kings 3:7). Josephus, probably reflecting the tradition of his time, fixes his age at fourteen; Eupolemus at twelve.

What the charge is is explained presently] of the Lord thy God to walk in His ways, to keep [same word] His statutes, and His commandments, and His judgments, and His testimonies [it is impossible to draw any clear and sharp distinction between these four words, as the older expositors do. \"The phrase is derived from the Pentateuch\" (Wordsworth). The force of the accumulation of practically synonymous terms is to represent the law in its entirety (\"Die Totalitat des Gesetzes,\" Keil); cf. Deuteronomy 5:31; Deuteronomy 8:11, and especially Psalm 119.], that thou mayest prosper. [The marginal rendering, \"do wisely,\" is preferred by some (Keil, e.g.); but the translation of the text has the authority of Gesenius and others on its side, and gives a better meaning. \"The context evidently requires 'prosper' here, as in Joshua 1:7\" (Rawlinson). \"That thou mayest... do wisely\" is a very lame and impotent conclusion to ver. 3. We have here an evident reminiscence of Joshua 1:7; possibly also of Deuteronomy 29:9. David was unquestionably well versed in the Scriptures of that age, of which every king was commanded to make a copy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - That the Lord may continue [rather, \"establish\" (ut confirmet), as it is rendered in 2 Samuel 7:25, where this same word of promise is spoken cf. Cf. 1 Kings 8:26] His word which He spake concerning me [by the mouth of Nathan, 2 Samuel 7:12-17 (cf. Psalm 89:4); or David may refer to some subsequent promise made to him directly. In the promise of 2 Samuel 7. there is no mention of any stipulations, \"If thy children,\" etc. But both here and in Psalm 122:12, and in 1 Kings 8:25, special prominence is given to the condition (dum se bene gesserint), which no doubt was understood, if not expressed, when the promise was first made], saying, If thy children take heed to [lit., \"keep,\" same word as in vers. 2, 3] their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee [lit., \"be cut off to thee,\" as marg. (cf. 1 Samuel 2:29; Joshua 9:23). This word does not occur in the original promise made through Nathan. But it does occur in subsequent versions of the promise, 1 Kings 8:25; 1 Kings 9:5, as well as here - a strong presumption that the promise must have been repeated to David in another shape], said he, a man on the throne of Israel. But this thought - that the permanence of his dynasty depended on the faithful observance of the law as it is written in the book of Moses (i.e., in all its details), seems to have reminded the dying man that he himself had not always kept the statutes he was urging his successor to keep. It had been his duty as king, as the power ordained of God, to visit all violations of the law of God with their appropriate penalties; and this duty, in some instances at least, had been neglected. For the law of Moses, reaffirming the primaeval law which formed part of the so called \"precepts of Noah\" (Genesis 6) - that ix. blood must be expiated by blood - enjoined, with singular emphasis and distinctness, the death of the murderer (Numbers 35:16, 17, 18, 19, 30-33; Exodus 21:14). It declared that so long as murder remained unpunished, the whole land was defiled and under a curse (Numbers 35:33). And it gave the king no power to pardon, no discretion in the matter. Until the red stain of blood was washed out \"by the blood of him that shed it\" the Divine Justice was not satisfied, and a famine or pestilence or sword might smite the land. Now, David knew all this: he could not fail to know it, for he had seen his country, a few years before, visited by a famine because of the unavenged blood of the Gibeonites (2 Samuel 21:1). And yet, one notorious and infamous murderer had not been put to death. The assassin of Abner and of Amasa still polluted the earth, still occupied a distinguished position, and defied punishment. But if the law of Moses was to be kept, then, whatever it might cost, and however painful it might be (Deuteronomy 19:13), he must die; and David, for the welfare of his kingdom, the stability of his throne, and above all, the honour of God, must require his death. No doubt it had often burdened his mind, especially during these last days of feebleness, the thought that punishment had been so long delayed; and therefore, as he sees the end approaching, he feels that he must enjoin upon his successor the fulfilment of that duty which he had been too \"weak\" to discharge (2 Samuel 3:39). Hence he proceeds,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - \"Moreover, thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Zeruiah [there is no \"emphasis on these words: he who was mine own sister's son,\" as Wordsworth, see on 1:113, did to me and [this last word has no place in the original, and should be left out, as it is misleading. It makes David demand the death of Joab partly because of the private injuries he had suffered at his hands, and partly because of his two brutal murders mentioned presently. But this is just what David did not do; for he is careful to exclude all mention of his private wrongs. It is true, he says, \"what Job did to me,\" but that is because \"the sovereign is smitten in the subject\" (Bp. Hall), and because the first of these murders had caused David to be suspected of complicity, while each had deprived him of an able officer. And the words that follow] what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel [these words are clearly explicative of the \"what he did to me.\" Only thus can we explain the absence of the \"and\"] unto Abner the son of Jether [2 Samuel 3:27. This was one of those foul murders to which the law expressly denied any right of sanctuary, for it was \"with guile\" (Exodus 21:14). Joab \"took Abner aside in the gate to speak with him peaceably, and smote him there in the abdomen\"], and unto Amasa the son of Jether [or Ithra. In 2 Samuel 27:24, Ithra is called \"an Israelite,\" an obvious mistake for \"Ishmaelite,\" as indeed it stands in 1 Chronicles 2:17. Amasa's mother, Abigail, was sister of David and Zeruiah; Amasa, consequently, was Joab's first cousin. This murder was even fouler than that of Abner. Here there were ties of blood; they were companions in arms, and there was no pretence of a vendetta], whom he slew and shed [lit., \"put,\" a somewhat strange expression. It almost looks as if עָלָיו, \"upon him,\" had dropped out. The meaning \"make,\" which Keil assigns to שִׂים is not borne out by his references, Deuteronomy 14:1; Exodus 10:2. \"Showed,\" \"displayed,\" is nearer the original], the blood of war in peace [the meaning is obvious. Blood might lawfully be shed in time of war, in fair fight; and Joab might have slain the two captains in battle without guilt. But he slew them when they were at peace with him and unprepared, by treachery], and put the blood of war [the LXX. has αῖμα ἀθῶον, \"innocent blood\"] upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet [we are not to suppose that the girdle and sandal are mentioned as \"die Zeichen des Kriegerstandes \" (Bahr), i.e., military insignia; nor yet that the idea is \"from the girdle to the sandal\" (Ewald), i.e., copiously. These are, usual (hardly \"principal,\" as Keil) articles of Eastern dress, of the civilian's as well as of the soldier's, and these two are mentioned because, no doubt, the horrible details of the two murders, and especially of the last (see 2 Samuel 20:8), had been reported to David. He had been told at the time how the blood of Amasa had spurted on to the girdle of Joab, and streamed down into his sandals, and these details, which no doubt made a deep impression upon his mind, are recited here to show how dastardly and treacherous was the deed, and how thoroughly Joab was stained with innocent blood, blood which cried to heaven for vengeance (Genesis 4:10)].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Do therefore according to thy wisdom [cf. Proverbs 20:26. It needed great discretion in exacting the punishment of death in the case of one who was so powerful, who had such influence with the army and the people, whose crimes had been passed over for so long a time, to whom David was so much indebted - Joab had partly won and had twice preserved for him his crown - and to whom he was allied by ties of blood. To act precipitately or unwisely might provoke a revolution], and let not his hoar head [see on ver. 9. Joab, though David's nephew, could not have been much his junior, and David was now seventy] go down to the grave in peace. [He must die a violent, not a natural death, as Corn. a Lap. This expression, no doubt, looks vindictive, but that is solely because we forget the character of the Old Testament dispensation (as one of temporal rewards and punishments. See the \"Expositor,\" vol. 3. p. 114), the position of David as king (as the authorized dispenser of punishments, and as responsible to God for dispensing them without fear or favour), and the principles of the Mosaic code (as a lex talionis, demanding blood for blood, and requiring the magistrates and people to purge themselves of the guilt of blood by demanding \"the blood of him that shed it\"). Let these considerations be borne in mind, and there is absolutely no warrant for charging David with malevolence. Wordsworth lays stress on the fact that Joab had not repented of his crimes. But we need have recourse to no such suppositions. The Jewish law afforded no place of repentance to the murderer. No amount of contrition would cleanse the land of blood. The temporal penalty must be paid. In the case of David himself, it was only commuted by special revelation (2 Samuel 12:10, 13, 14), not remitted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And to the sons of Barzillai [the \"Beni-Barzillai\" would include son, or sons, and all other descendants. It is highly probable, though it is not expressly stated, that Chimham was the son of Bar-zillai (2 Samuel 19:37). Rawlinson says, \"Who the other sons were is not known.\" It would be more correct to say that we do not know whether there were any other sons. The family was still existing temp. Ezra (Ezra 2:61), where, it is worth noticing, we read of the daughters of Barzillai (cf. Nehemiah 7:63). In Jeremiah 41:17, we read of the \"habitation (גֵּדוּת, caravanserai, khan) of Chemoham,\" where the Keri has Chimham. It has been argued from the mention of this name, and the fact that their khan was near Bethlehem, that David or Solomon gave the family land there], and let them be of those that eat at thy table [i.e., of those who have their sustenance from the royal table, not necessarily at it (Keil); cf. Daniel 1:5; 2 Kings 25:29. Presence at the table is expressed by עַל שֻׂלְחָן (2 Samuel 11, 12). It was esteemed an essential part of royal munificence throughout the East that the king should feed a large number of retainers and dependants. Cf. the account of Solomon's daffy provision in 1 Kings 4:22, 23; also 2 Samuel 19:28; Judges 1:7]; for so [i.e., in like manner, with food]; they came to me [lit., \"came near.\" The Hebrew קָרַב often includes, as here, the idea of succour. Cf. Psalm 69:19; Lamentations 3:57. Barzillai certainly came (2 Samuel 17:27), and probably Chimham, but the Speaker's Commentary is mistaken when it says that \"Chimham is mentioned as present.\" He was present at the return of David (2 Samuel 19:31, 38, but not necessarily before] when I fled because of [lit., \"from the face of \"] Absalom thy brother. The mention of Absalom, and those terrible days of revolt and anarchy, when he was constrained to flee for his life, seems to have reminded the dying king of one of the bitterest ingredients of that bitter cup of shame and suffering - the cruel curses of Shimei. He remembers that the sin of Shimei, which was nothing else than treason and blasphemy, has so far escaped punishment. In a moment of generous enthusiasm, he had included Shimei in the general amnesty which he proclaimed on his return (2 Samuel 19:23). He had thought, no doubt, at the time only of the offence against himself; he had forgotten his sacred and representative character as \"the Lord's anointed;\" or if he had remembered it (ver. 21) the emotions of that memorable day had obscured or perverted his sense of justice and duty. But he has since realized - and the thought weighs upon his conscience in the chamber of death - that he then pardoned what he had no power to pardon, viz., a sin to which the Mosaic law attached the penalty of death. For blasphemy, as for murder, there was no expiation short of the death of the blasphemer (Leviticus 24:14-16; cf. 1 Kings 21:10, 13); and blasphemy, like murder, though not perhaps to the same extent, involved those who heard it in its guilt, until they had discharged themselves of their sin upon the head of the guilty (Leviticus 14:14; cf. Leviticus 5:1). But Shimei, so far from having suffered the penalty of the law, had been twice protected against it; twice preserved alive, in defiance of law, by the supreme magistrate, the executor of law. And David, who has been charging his son to keep the law, now realizes that he himself has been a law breaker. He has kept his oath, sworn to his own or his people's hurt, and he will keep it to the end. But Solomon is under no such obligation. He can demand the long arrears of justice, none the less due because of the time that has elapsed and the royal laches (\"nullum tempus occurrit regi\"); he can deal with the blasphemer as the law directs, and this David now charges him to do.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And, behold, thou hast with thee [Bahr understands by עִמְּך, \"near thee,\" (in deiner Nahe) because Bahurim was near Jerusalem. Keil gathers from this word that Shimei \"was living at that time in Jerusalem,\" and refers to ver. 36, which, if anything, implies that he was not. But it is worth suggesting whether Shimei may not be the Shimei to whom reference is made in 1 Kings 1:8. (Dean Stanley notices this as a possibility, but alleges nothing in support of it: \"Jewish Church,\" vol. 2 p. 171, note.) We there find Shimei and Rei mentioned as firm adherents of Solomon at the time of Adonijah's rising, and in these words, they \"were not with Adonijah.\" Surely it is not an unfair presumption - if there is nothing to rebut it - that the Shimei subsequently mentioned as \"with\" Solomon is the same person. But it has been objected (e.g., by Kitto) that the false part that Shimei played at the time of Absalom's revolt would have forever prevented his being recognized and mentioned as one of Solomon's supporters. I very much doubt it. The great influence which Shimei possessed must be taken into account. Nothing shows that influence more clearly than the fact that on the day of David's restoration, despite the part he had taken, and the possible disgrace and danger that awaited him, he could still command the attendance of one thousand men of Benjamin (2 Samuel 19:17). Probably the secret of his influence lay in the fact that he was \"of the family of the house of Saul,\" and possibly, owing to the insignificance of Saul's descendants, was the mainstay and chief representative of that house. And if so, there is nothing at all surprising in the mention of the fact that he was \"not with Adonijah,\" and was subsequently \"with\" Solomon. It may have been a matter of great consequence at that critical time, which side Shimei - and the thousand or more Benjamites at his back - espoused. And if he did then declare for Solomon, it could hardly fail to procure him some amount of favour and consideration. He would thenceforward rank amongst the friends of the young king, and the words \"thou hast with thee\" would accurately describe his position] Shimei, the son of Gera [another Shimei, the son of Elah, is mentioned (1 Kings 4:11) as Solomon's officer in Benjamin. Gera must not be thought of as the \"father\" of Shimei, except in the sense of ancestor. He was removed from him by many generations, being the son of Bela and the grandson of Benjamin (Genesis 46:21; cf. 1 Chronicles 7:6). Ehud, three hundred years earlier, is also described as \"a son of Gera,\" Judges 3:15], a Benjamite [lit., the Benjamite, meaning that Gera, not Shimei, was the Benjamite. He was well known as the son of Benjamin's firstborn (1 Chronicles 8:l), and the head of a house in Benjamin. Professor Gardiner (American translation of Lange, textual note, p. 29), following the LXX. and Vulg., insists that, בֶּן־הַיְּמִינִי (with the article) can only mean \"son of the Jaminite, i.e., of the descendants of Jamin, a son of Simeon.\" But this is directly contrary to what we read 9 1 Samuel 16, viz., that Shimei was of \"a family of the house of Saul,\" i.e., a Benjamite. And to this the grammar agrees. Judges 3:15 is an exact parallel, and compare בֵּית־הַלַּחְמִי, 1 Samuel 6:14, 18, and בֵּית־הַלַּחְמִי, 1 Samuel 16:1, 18; 1 Samuel 17:58] of Bahurim [the name means \"The young men.\" It was some six miles distant from Jerusalem, in Benjamin, and on (or off, as Josephus, Ant. 7:09, 7, implies) the main road to Jericho and the Jordan valley. It may have lain in one of the waddies branching out from the ravine which runs continuously alongside the steep descent to Jericho. The event narrated in 2 Samuel 3:16 as happening at Bahurim may well have served to inflame Shimei's hatred. In spite of his rancorous hostility, however, we gather from 2 Samuel 17:18, that David had some faithful adherents there], which [lit., \"and he\"] cursed me with a grievous [acc. to Gesenius, al., \"strong,\" i.e., sweeping; Keil, vehement; Thenius, \"heillos,\" flagitious. LXX., κατάραν ὀδυνηρὰν. Vulg., maledictio pessima] curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim [2 Samuel 16:5]; but he came down to meet me at Jordan [lit., the Jordan, i.e., the descender, so called from the rapidity of the stream (it has a fall of 1400 feet in about 100 miles) or from the steep descents which lead to it. The word always has the defin. art.], and I sware to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword [2 Samuel 19:23].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now therefore [lit., \"and now.\" Possibly the \"now\" is a note of time in apposition to the \"day\" of ver. 8, or rather the time of David's oath. \"I then unadvisedly swam unto him, but now the law must have its course.\" Probably it is merely inferential, - quae cum ita sint] hold him not guiltless [rather, thou shalt not leave him unpunished (Vatablus, Gesen., Bahr, al.); cf. Exodus 20:7; Jeremiah 30:11]; for thou art a wise man [φρόνιμος rather than σοφός (LXX.) Gesen. renders here, \"endued with ability to judge.\" David clearly desires that wisdom and justice, not malice or passion, should be Solomon's guide], and knowest what thou oughtest to [lit., shalt or shouldest] do to him; but [Heb. and] his hoar head [mentioned, not maliciously, but with the idea that punishment, which had been long delayed, must overtake him nevertheless. The age of Joab and Shimei would make the Divine Nemesis the more conspicuous. Men would \"see that there was a God that judgeth in the earth\"] bring thou down to the grave with blood. The Auth. Version here needlessly alters the order of the original, which should be followed wherever it can be (and it generally can) without sacrifice of idiom and elegance. In this case the alteration, by the slight prominence it gives to \"hoar head\" and to \"blood,\" gives a factitious harshness to the sentence. The Hebrew stands thus: \"And thou shalt bring down his hoar head with blood to Sheol.\" This order of the words also exhibits somewhat more clearly the sequence of thought, which is this: \"Thou art wise, therefore thou knowest what by law thou shouldest do. What thou shalt do is, thou shalt bring down,\" etc. It is clear from these words that if David was actuated by malice, by a \"passionate desire to punish those who had wronged him\" (Plumptre, Dict. Bib., art. \"Solomon\"), or by \"fierce and profound vindictiveness\" (Stanley, \"Jewish Church,\" vol. 2. p. 135), he was profoundly unconscious of it. If it was \"a dark legacy of hate\" (ibid.) he was bequeathing to Solomon, then he stands before us in these last hours either as an unctuous hypocrite, or as infatuated and inconsistent to the last degree. That the man who, in his opening words (ver. 3), enjoined upon his son, in the most emphatic manner, a strict and literal obedience to the law of Heaven, should in these subsequent words, delivered almost in the same breath, require him to satiate a long-cherished and cruel revenge upon Joab and Shimei (the latter of whom he had twice delivered from death), is an instance of self contradiction which is almost, if not quite, without parallel. But as I have showed elsewhere, at some length, it is a superficial and entirely erroneous view of David's last words, which supposes them to have been inspired by malice or cruelty. His absorbing idea was clearly this, that he had not \"kept the charge of the Lord;\" that he, the chief magistrate, the \"revenger to execute wrath,\" by sparing Joab and Shimei, the murderer and the blasphemer, both of whose lives were forfeited to justice, had failed in his duty, had weakened the sanctions of law, and compromised the honour of the Most High. He is too old and too weak to execute the sentence of the law now, but for the safety of his people, for the security of his throne, it must be done, and therefore Solomon, who was under no obligation to spare the criminals his father had spared, must be required to do it. Of the Jewish king it might be said with a special propriety, \"Rex est lex loquens,\" and seldom has the voice of law spoken with greater dignity and fidelity than by David in this dying charge. To say, as Harwood does, (Lange, American Trans., p. 32) that \"nothing but sophistry can justify his [David's] charge to Solomon, not to let the unfortunate man [Shimei] die in peace,\" merely shows how imperfectly the writer has entered into the spirit of the theocratic law, that law under which David lived, and by which alone he could be governed and govern others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - So [Heb. and] David slept [Heb. lay down]. The idea of ָשכַב is not that of sleep so much as of the recumbent posture of the dead. It points to the grave rather than to Sheol (Gesen.), though the latter idea is not excluded. Wordsworth (after a Lapide) finds here \"an assertion of the doctrine of the existence of the soul after death, and of the resurrection of the body,\" but it is not in the text] with his fathers (cf. the Latin expression abiit ad plures, and the Greek ἐς πλεόνων ἱκέσθαι], and was buried in the city of David [i.e. the hill of Zion, which he had fortified, His citadel became his sepulchre, and thenceforward bore his name. Intramural interment was permitted only to prophets and kings. Jerusalem is completely under. mined by caves and caverns, and Zion is no exception to the rule. One of these, possibly enlarged, probably became the burying place of the kings. It was known, not only in Nehemiah's day (Nehemiah 3:15, 16), but down to the age of the apostles (Acts 2:29). Probably owing to a misunderstanding of St. Peter's words, \"his sepulchre is with us,\" etc., the Coenaculum is now shown as David's tomb. Josephus says Solomon placed a vast quantity of treasure with the body, three thousand talents of which were taken out by Hyrcanus (Ant. 13:08.4). He has also a curious story of an attempted plunder of the tomb by Herod (Ant. 16:07.1)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem [as elsewhere (1 Chronicles 29:27), the historian has disregarded the fraction of a year in giving the length of David's reign.

[Cf. 2 Chronicles 1:1, 2. This verse serves as a kind of heading or introduction to the rest of the chapter. It was principally by the removal of rivals and disaffected persons that his sway was established.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon.

[The LXX. adds καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτη, but the words are probably inserted from ver. 19. The historian now relates the plot of Adonijah and its defeat. Foiled in his purpose to mount the throne by direct means, Adonijah and his advisers have recourse to intrigue and subtlety. By the aid of Abishag, he hopes to accomplish what his chariots and horsemen (1 Kings 1:5) had failed to effect. And he first addresses himself to the queen mother (\"Aggreditur mulierem, ut regnandi ignaram ira amoribus facilem.\" Grotius). The position of the queen dowager m the Hebrew kingdom was an influential one; not unlike that of the Valide sultana amongst the Ottomans. Hence the constant mention of each king's mother (1 Kings 14:31; 1 Kings 15:10, where notice ver. 13; 2 Kings 11:1; 2 Kings 12:1; 2 Kings 14:2; 2 Kings 15:2, etc.; hence, too, the part which such a queen mother as Athaliah found it possible to take. This pre-eminence was a natural result of the polygamy of Eastern sovereigns (and the consequent intrigues of the harem), coupled with the high estimation in which the mother was held in the East.] And she said, Comest thou peaceably. [Heb. Is it peace thy coming! Bathsheba was evidently surprised by his visit. Owing to the part he had taken against her son, there would naturally have been but few dealings, if not positive alienation, between them. Her first thought, consequently, is, \"What can this coming mean?\" The prominence of the idea of peace in all Eastern salutations has often been noticed. Cf. 1 Samuel 16:4; 2 Kings 9:22; 2 Kings 4:26; 2 Kings 5:21; Luke 10:5; John 20:19-21, etc.] And he said, Peaceably [Heb. peace.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He said moreover [Heb.

Adonijah evidently made much of the right of primogeniture (cf. ver. 22), which was not unrecognized amongst the Jews. There is possibly in these words, too, a hint at the part Bathsheba had taken in defeating his claims] and that all Israel set their faces [i.e., eyes] upon me that I should reign [Heb. upon me all Israel set, etc. The \"me\" is emphatic by its position. So is the \"mine\" just before used. Several commentators remark that Adonijah's words were not strictly true. But we hardly expect to find truth on such an occasion. Adonijah was adroit and diplomatic, and puts the case as it best serves his purpose. In order to propitiate Bathsheba, he exaggerates his loss and disappointment, just as in the next words, in order to put her off her guard, he plays the saint and obtrudes his piety and resignation ]: howbeit [lit., and], the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from the Lord. [This verse shows pretty clearly that Adoni-jah had not renounced his pretensions to the throne. Despite the pitiful failure of his first conspiracy, and notwithstanding Solomon's generous condonation of his treason, he cannot forget that he was, and is, the eldest surviving son, and had been very near the throne. And as to the kingdom being his brother's by Divine appointment, he cannot have been ignorant of that long ago (2 Samuel 12:25), yet he conspired all the same. And it is not difficult to read here between the lines, that he has not relinquished his hopes, and does not acquiesce in Solomon's supremacy.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And now I ask one petition of thee [Heb. request one request] deny me not [marg., \"turn not away my face.\" Better, Turn not back, i.e., repulse not. Rawlinson paraphrases, \"Make me not to hide my face through shame at being refused;\" but this is not the idea of the original, which means, Reject me not; send me not away. In the Heb. \"face\" often stands for \"person,\" for eyes (ver. 15), looks, mien]. And she said unto him, Say on.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the ring; for he will not say thee nay, [will not repulse thee. Same words as ver. 16. There is a spice of flattery in these words. He now exaggerates her influence with the king] that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. [We are hardly justified in concluding, as some commentators have done, that love had nothing to do with this request. It is not improbable, on the contrary, that a passion for the beautiful Shunamnite, perhaps the fairest woman of her time, may have first given a powerful impulse to Adonijah's ambition (see on 1 Kings 1:5). At the same time, he must have had ulterior motives (see on ver. 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And Bathsheba said, Well [there is no reason why the strict rendering \"good,\" should not be preserved here.

There is not necessarily a pregnant construction, as Keil insists: \"rose up and went down to meet her.\" We get here a glimpse of the stateliness of Solomon's court] and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat [lit., throne, same word] to be set [most probably the servants of Solomon placed the seat for the queen mother, as the LXX.

And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.

He explains the facts, however, by \"Mr. Grove's ingenious theory identifying Abishag with the Shulamite (Song of Solomon 6:13), the heroine of the Song of Songs.\" It is \"the passionate love of Solomon for the fairest among women' that has made Bathsheba, \"hitherto supreme, to fear a rival influence, and to join in any scheme for its removal.\" The king's vehement abruptness is in like manner accounted for. He sees in the request at once an attempt to deprive him of the woman he loves and a plot to keep him still in the tutelage of childhood. Of the ingenuity of this theory no one can doubt, nor yet that it may possibly represent the actual facts. But it is not necessary, nor does it help much to the explanation of the narrative.

This request is evidence to him of a fresh plot against his throne, a plot so skilfully laid that its abettors have been able to deceive his own mother, and have made her a tool for its advancement. Surely this is quite enough to account for Solomon's indignation. And the theory of a love story has this disadvantage, that the young king completely ignores it in what follows, all his concern being about the kingdom, and not one word being said about the woman; and again - and this is almost fatal - his mention of Joab and Abiathar, and his subsequent dealings with them, prove conclusively that he suspected a conspiracy against his crown, not a scheme, in which these latter could have had no interest, and therefore no part, to rob him of a mistress] ask for him the kingdom also [Heb. and ask for him = and (you will next) ask for him; or, Aye, ask for him, etc. It was quite natural that Solomon should see in Adonijah's suit for Abishag an indirect, but none the less real or dangerous, attempt to compass his own downfall. For it was one of the customs of Oriental monarchies that the harem of a sovereign descended to his successor. Thus the impostor Smerdis took possession of the harem of Cambyses (Herod. 3:68), while Darius in turn had some of the wives of Smerdis (3:88). And what is much more to the point, a similar custom obtained amongst the Jews. David, for example, succeeded to the wives, along with the kingdom, of Saul (2 Samuel 12:8). And we see from the case of Abner and Rizpah (2 Samuel 3:8), and still more from that of Absalom (ch. 16:22), that to \"take possession of the harem was the most decided act of sovereignty\" (Lord A. Hervey, Speak. Com. on 2 Samuel 16:21). Now all these instances were of too recent a date, and had attracted far too much attention at the time, to have made it possible for them to have escaped either Solomon's or Adonijah's observation. They manifest \"such a close connection in public opinion between the title to the crown and the possession of the deceased monarch's wives, that to have granted Adonijah's request would have been the strongest encouragement to his pretensions\" (Rawlinson in loco). It may be said that Abishag had not really been the concubine of David (ch. 1:4), which is true, and which explains what would otherwise have been the astonishing impiety of Adonijah (Leviticus 18:8; Leviticus 20:11; cf. 1 Corinthians 5:1), and the wonderful complaisance of Bathsheba. There is no warrant for charging Adonijah (as is done by a Lapide, Wordsworth, al.) with defying the Divine law and seeking an incestuous alliance, for the historian is careful to represent Abishag as David's attendant, and not as his wife. But it is hardly probable that the nation at large knew this. People generally could only suppose that this fair young girl, chosen out of all the thousands of Israel because of her beauty, had become to all intents and purposes one of the royal seraglio. It is almost a certainty, therefore, that Adonijah's request concealed a plot for using Abishag as a stepping stone to the throne, and Solomon certainly is not to be blamed if he interpreted it by the light of contemporaneous history, and by the usages of his time and country. He knew that his brother had made one deliberate effort to supplant him, and therefore he could only conclude that this was a second, though veiled, attempt to deprive him of his kingdom]; even for him and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. [The LXX. and other translators appear to have had a slightly different text before them. The LXX. renders, καὶ αὐτῷ Ἀβιάθαρ καὶ αὐτῷ, κ.τ.λ.; the Vulgate, \"et habet Abiathar,\" etc. The Chald. paraphrases, \"nonne in cansilio fuerunt ille et Abiathar,\" etc. Keil well remarks that \"the repetition of answers entirely to the emotional character of the words.\" We can hardly believe, however, that in these conversations we have the ipsissima verba of the speakers If so, how were they preserved and handed down to the author? Even a \"court scribe\" would hardly catch every turn of expression. And possibly this interview with Bathsheba was private. It would almost seem, from the immediate mention of Joab and Abiathar, as if Solomon had received some prior intimation of this second conspiracy. Possibly his remarkable penetration had divined that mischief was brewing from the bearing of the three, who no doubt would be narrowly watched. Or he may have heard of frequent meetings on their part. Anyhow, Adonijah's suit is to him conclusive proof of a plot].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Then king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also [a common form of adjuration (Ruth 1:17; 1 Samuel 14:44; 1 Samuel 20:13; 2 Samuel 3:9; 2 Samuel 19:13, etc.) = Gott soil mich fort und fort strafen. Bahr], if [or \"that.\" כִּי constantly follows formulae of swearing, as in all the passages just cited. Cf. the use of ὅτι in New Testament. The order of the next words in the Hebrew is noticeable] against his life spake Adonijah this word.

Bahr says Solomon's \"marriage did not occur till afterwards (1 Kings 3:1). And we find from 1 Kings 11:38; 2 Samuel 7:11, 27, that to 'make,' or 'build an house,' means to found a lasting dynasty\"], as he promised [Heb. spake, i.e., at 2 Samuel 7:11-13], Adonijah shall be put to death this day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And King Solomon sent by the hand [i.e., the instrumentality; not necessarily eigenhandig, as Thenius. Cf. Exodus 4:13; 1 Samuel 16:20, Hebrews; 1 Kings 12:15; 1 Kings 14:18; Jeremiah 37:2 (\"which he spake by the hand of Jeremiah\"), etc. The same expression is found in ver. 46 of this chapter] of Benaiah [in the East the captain of the king's bodyguard has always been the \"chief of the executioners,\" the title given to Potiphar, Genesis 37:36, Hebrews; in 2 Kings 25:8 to Nebuzar-Adan; and in Daniel 2:14 to Arioch \"the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men, etc.] and he fell upon him so that he died. [Solomon has been accused of \"a coldblooded vengeance\" and of \"that jealous cruelty so common in Oriental despots,\" in ordering the execution of his brother. But unjustly. It is to be remembered that on the occasion of Adonijah's first rebellion the young monarch had displayed the greatest magnanimity towards him. He might then have justly decreed against him the death which no doubt the conspirators had designed against him (1 Kings 1:12.) Adonijah, by fleeing to the altar, showed that he had good grounds for fearing the avenging sword. He was clearly conscious that he had merited the death of the traitor. But Solomon spared him, during good behaviour. He warned him that \"if wickedness were found in him\" he should die (1 Kings 1:52.) His first treason, consequently, was not to be lost sight of, in case he were guilty of a fresh offence. And now that he is found conspiring again; now that he abuses the royal clemency, and seeks by chicanery and intrigue to snatch his brother's crown, the sentence of death takes effect. This renewed attempt, after failure and forgiveness, must have convinced the king that Adonijah's pretensions would be a standing menace to the peace and prosperity of his empire, and therefore he owed it to himself, to his subjects, and above all to God, who had entrusted him with the crown, to put this restless and dangerous plotter out of the way. To pass over a second offence would be a virtual encouragement of sedition, for it would show that the king was weak and might be trifled with. Adonijah therefore must die, not only in expiation of his treason, but as an example to the subjects of Solomon, that the disaffected, including all Adonijah's partizans, might be awed into obedience.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 2:26-35. THE DEPOSITION OF ABIATHAR AND THE DEATH OF JOAB.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And unto Abiathar the priest [see note on 1 Kings 1:8. The historian now relates the end of Adonijah's confederates] said the king, get thee to Anathoth [The Heb. is extremely curt and authoritative, corresponding well with the anger and determination of the speaker. Anathoth, the home of Abiathar, was also the residence of another high priest, Hilkiah (Jeremiah 1:1). It was in Benjamin, a priests' city, and had suburbs (Jeremiah 21:13, 17, 18). It has been identified by Robinson with Anita, a village 1.25 hrs. N.N.E, of Jerus. The name ( = Answers) according to Gesenius, means, \"answers to prayer,\" but according to the Talmud, \"echoes\"], unto [עַל is here almost the equivalent of אֶל. Cf. 2 Samuel 15:4, 20, Hebrews etc.] thine own fields [the patrimony of his family] for thou art worthy of death; [Heb. a man of death; LXX. ἀνὴρ θανάτου, i.e., ἔνοχος θανάτου, Matthew 26:66.] but I will not at this time [Heb. in this day] put thee to death [i.e., the sentence of death was deferred during good behaviour. It is hardly correct to say that Abiathar was \"spared for a time, but only for a time\" (Stanley). More correctly Corn. a Lapide: \"Misit eum in patriam ut ibi vitam, quam ei condonabat, quiete tradu-ceret.\" For aught we know, he died in peace because thou barest the ark of the Lord God before David my father [Thenius, quite needlessly would read for \"ark,\" .... \"ephod\" (1 Samuel 23:6). Zadok and Abiathar had borne the ark (not of course in person, but per altos, viz., the Levites Uriel, Joel, etc.: 1 Chronicles 15:11), when David brought it up to Jerusalem, and also during his flight from Absalom (2 Samuel 15:24-29). Abiathar had thus been associated both with David's joys and sorrows] and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. [See 1 Samuel 22:17-23; 2 Samuel 15:24, etc.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - So Solomon thrust out Abtathar from being priest unto the Lord, that he might fulfil [Heb. to fulfil \"An addition of the narrator, not the intention of Solomon. It is the ἵνα πληρωθῇ of the New Testament.\" Bahr] the word of the Lord, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh [1 Samuel 2:31-35. Abiathar was the last descendant of the house of Ithamar. With his deposition the high priesthood reverted to the house of Eleazar, and so another \"word of the Lord\" had its fulfilment (Numbers 25:15).] No one can justly accuse Solomon of unnecessary severity or of cruelty in his treatment of Abiathar. On the occasion of his first conspiracy, Abiathar seems to have escaped even censure. And yet that conspiracy, had it succeeded, would almost certainly have involved Solomon's death (ch. 1:12). He is now found plotting again, for the action of Solomon proves that there had been a second plot. Oriental usages would have justified his death. He is simply warned and banished.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Then tidings [Heb. And the report, etc. Not necessarily of Abiathar's deposition, but certainly of Adonijah's death] came to Joab, for Joab had turned after [same expression as in Exodus 23:2; Judges 9:3] Adonijah, though [lit., and] he turned not after Absalom. [The LXX. (Cod. Vat.), Vulg., and all ancient versions except the Chald., here read Solomon, which Ewald and Thenius adopt. This reading is perhaps too summarily dismissed by most commentators, as involving a statement which would be self evident and superfluous. But it is not so. The meaning would then be that Joab had inclined to Adonijah, and had not, subsequently, gone over to the side of Solomon - information which is much less obvious than that he had not \"gone after Absalom.\" The Arabic version may thus be nearest the truth, which reads, \"Neither did he love Solomon.\" Somewhat similarly Josephus.] And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar. [As Adonijah had done before him (1 Kings 1:50). His flight is almost certain evidence of his guilt. (\"Joab vero seipsum prodidit.\" Munster.) Why should he flee, if conscious of innocence? Solomon had acted generously before, and Joab would not be aware of David's dying instructions. His two assassinations had remained so long unpunished that he would hardly expect to be called to an account for them now. We have here, therefore, another indication of a second conspiracy, and it is an old belief (Theodorot, al.) that Joab had suggested to Adonijah the plan of marriage with Abishag. Some have asked why Joab should flee to the altar when his crimes deprived him of the right of the sanctuary. But a drowning man grasps at a straw. It is probable that he never thought of his murders, but only of his treason. According to the Rabbis, death at the altar ensured him burial amongst his fathers (Munster). But, if this were so, it would hardly enter into his calculations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord; and, behold, he is by the altar. [The LXX. here inserts, \"And Solomon the king sent to Joab, saying, What has happened thee, that thou art fled to the altar? And Joab said, Because I feared before thee, and I fled to the Lord.\" This is only a gloss, but it is an instructive one. It shows that the author regarded Joab's flight as betraying a guilty conscience.] Then Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. [The LXX. adds, \"and bury him.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him [Benaiah evidently \"hesitated to stain the altar with blood.\" It was only the sanctity of the altar which made it an asylum. There was strictly no \"right of sanctuary\"], Thus saith the king, Come forth. [Probably Solomon bad directed that Joab should, if possible, be induced to leave the altar. Every Jew would dread its profanation by strife and bloodshed.] And he said, Nay; but I will die here. [Heb. \"here will I die.\" Joab may possibly have thought that Solomon would hardly venture to put him to death there, and that so he might somehow escape with his life. But it is more probable that he counted on death, and that a feeling of superstition, or of defiance, had decided him to meet his doom there. It should be borne in mind that gross superstition not uncommonly accompanies irreligion and brutality; and it is quite conceivable that Joab hoped for some indefinable benefit from the shadow of the altar, much as the poor Polish Jew expects from burial in Jerusalem. Or his motive may have been defiance, thinking he would \"render Solomon odious to the people, as a profaner of the Holy Place\" (M. Henry). It can hardly have been to put off forever so short a time the execution, as Bishop Hall imagines.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And the king said unto him do as he hath said, and fall upon him [the law decreed (Exodus 21:14) that, if a man had slain his neighbour with guile, he should be taken from the altar to die. Possibly the desperate character of Joab made literal compliance with this command well nigh impossible. The attempt to drag him from his place of refuge might have led to a bloody encounter. And the king evidently felt that Joab's crimes justified exceptional measures], and bury him [why this injunction? Possibly because the spirit of Deuteronomy 21:23 seemed to Solomon to require it. Both Bahr and Keil think it was that Joab's services to the kingdom might be requited with an honourable sepulture. Was it not rather that the corpse might be removed with all possible haste from the sanctuary, which it defiled, and hidden from view, as one accursed of God, in the earth? So Bishop Hall: \"He sends Benaiah to take away the offender both from God and men, from the altar and the world\"]; that thou mayest take away [LXX. \"today,\" σήμερον] the innocent blood [for the construction cf. 1 Samuel 25:31; Nehemiah 2:12; and Ewald, 287d. Innocent blood, i.e., blood not shed in war, or forfeited to justice, rested upon the community, or the authorities responsible for its punishment (Numbers 35:33; Deuteronomy 19:10, 13; Deuteronomy 21:9. Cf. Genesis 4:10) until satisfaction was made. See on ver. 5], which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. [Heb. \"from upon me.\" Solomon evidently believed that the guilt of blood was upon him and his house so long as Abner's and Amasa's blood remained unavenged (\"The blood that is not required from the murderer will be required from the magistrate.\" Henry), and that he and his seed might have to answer for it, as Saul's seed had done (2 Samuel 21:1, 9). This is one of the many considerations which show that both David and Solomon were actuated not by \"cold-blooded vengeance\" or \"long-cherished resentment\" (Stanley), but by a sense of duty. In fact, Jewish law imperatively demanded the death of Joab, and to spare him was to violate all law, and to imperil the throne and the people. \"Only a superficial observer,\" says Ewald, \"can here reproach Solomon with needless severity.\"]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And the Lord shall return [LXX. ἐπέστρεψε, returns, or returned] his blood [LXX. τὸ αῖμα τῆς ἀδικίας αὐτοῦ, i.e., the blood he had shed.

There is an obvious reference to David's curse 2 Samuel 3:29, which thoroughly agreed with the spirit of the Old Testament in comprehending the children in its sweep. And it is to be noticed that the sins of the fathers are still, by the operation of natural laws, and by the constitution and laws of society, visited upon the children, to the third and fourth generation] forever: but upon [Heb. to] David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be [or \"be,\" optative; LXX. γένοιτο] peace [i.e., prosperity] forever from the Lord. [So persuaded is Solomon that he is fulfilling a religious duty in decreeing the execution of Joab; so little thought has he of malice, revenge, or any baser motive, that he counts on the Divine blessing m perpetuity for the deed.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up [not because the altar\" stood higher up Mount Zion than Solomon's house\" (Keil), but because Gibeon, where the tabernacle and brazen altar then were, stood higher than Jerusalem. It is remarkable that retribution thus overtook Joab on the very scene of his last murder, for it was \"at the great stone which is in Gibeon\" (2 Samuel 20:8), that he slew Amasa. Cf. 2 Kings 9:26: \"I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord\"], and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house [possibly in the courtyard: hardly in the garden. The same is recorded of Samuel (1 Samuel 25:1). It was evidently an exceptional occurrence. Remembering the estimation in which the Jew held the corpse and the grave (Numbers 19:11, 16, 22; cf. Matthew 23:27), it must have been a singular honour to make of the house a mausoleum. No doubt it was designed to be such in Joab's case. Whatever his crimes, his services had deserved well of his country. Possibly his friends were led to pay him this special honour as a kind of counterpoise to the ignominy of his death] in the wilderness [i.e., of Judah. Joab's mother was of Bethlehem, which was on the border of the desert.

Now his perversity may of course have been judicial - quos Dens vult perdere, prius de-mentat - but as to the means which led to this issue, it is enough if we may believe he had been dared to it either by his servants or others. The fierce Benjamite would naturally be galled to the quick by the thought that his slaves could thus openly set him at defiance; he may have heard from those who came from Gath that they were exulting over him; and he may have resolved at all hazards to teach them a lesson. He cannot have forgotten either Solomon's explicit warning or his own solemn oath (ver. 42); he must have gone to Gath with his eyes open, and nothing but a great provocation, such as mockery and defiance, will account for his going.] And Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings2:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and was come again.

He has defied and blasphemed the Lord's anointed. He must die] therefore the Lord shall return [\"hath returned,\" or \"returns.\" LXX. ἀνταπέδωκε, aor.

[The execution of Shimei has, perhaps, on the whole given more offence than that of Joab or even Adonijah. He, at any rate, was not \"a murderer whom vengeance suffereth not to live,\" nor had he taken any part in recent conspiracies. On the contrary, he seems to have lived quietly enough under the eye of the king. And it consequently has the appearance of cruelty and malevolence that Solomon should \"press the letter of a compact against him,\" especially when, by returning to Jerusalem, he placed his life at Solomon's mercy. But it is not difficult to offer a complete justification of Solomon's action in this matter. In the first place, it is to be remembered that cruelty had no part in his character. In his long reign of forty years there are absolutely no evidences of a brutal and tyrannical disposition. There is a strong presumption, consequently, that he was not actuated by cruelty on this occasion, a presumption which finds support in the consideration that Solomon was much too sagacious to prejudice himself in popular estimation at the commencement of his reign by proceedings which would have the least suspicion of vindictiveness. AndNEWLINENEWLINE(2) with this probability the facts of the case entirely agree. Shimei's life, as we have seen, was forfeited to Jewish law. As he had so long been spared, however, the king gave him a gracious respite. The conditions imposed were not onerous. Shimei had but to keep his parole and he would live; to break it and he would assuredly die. He did break it; not without provocation, it may be, but he broke it, and broke too his solemn oath. It may be said it was hard he should lose his slaves, but better, surely, lose them than his life. Besides, there were other ways of recovering them; or, if he must pursue them in person, his proper course was evidently to ask the king's permission. That he did not do so is in itself a suspicious circumstance, and Solomon might reasonably think that the flight of the slaves was but a feint, and that Shimei's visit to a foreign court had really a political object. But, be that as it may, the king had protested unto him that if he went any whither, he should most certainly die. When he went, when he despised the royal command and disregarded his sacred oath, how was it possible for Solomon to break his word? To do so would have been inevitably to compromise himself with his subjects, and to forfeit their reverence and trust. Besides, there was a duty he owed to his dead father, and above all, one which he owed to the living God. He had now the opportunity for which his father bade him wait, of putting into force the provisions of the Mosaic law, of requiring the death of the blasphemer, of showing his subjects that the law could not be defied with impunity, that though vengeance was not executed speedily against evil works, still retribution was certain in the long run, and so of teaching them a much needed lesson of obedience and respect of authority. Every consideration, therefore, of justice, morality, filial piety, and religion warranted him in putting Shimei to death. Every imputation of weakness, irresolution, disregard of his plighted word, compromise of his royal dignity, and indifference to religion might justly have been levelled against him, had he interfered between Shimei and the sword of Justice.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVer 1. - And Solomon made affinity [Not \"alliance\" (as some have supposed) but relationship. Lit., made himself son-in-law] with Pharaoh king of Egypt [which of the Pharaohs this was, it is impossible to say with certainty. As, however, Shishak (1 Kings 11:40; 1 Kings 14:25) is undoubtedly the Sheshonk who succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the 26th year of Solomon (Poole), and who was the first king of the 22nd dynasty of Manetho, we may safely identify this Pharaoh with \"a late king of the 21st (or Janite) dynasty.\" It has been assumed (Bunsen, Ewald, Brugsch, al.) that it was Psusennes II., the last king of that house, on the supposition that he reigned 35 years, (as stated by Eusebius), but according to Africanus, his reign was limited to 14 years. It is wiser to say, therefore, with Mr. Poole (Dict. Bib., \"Pharaoh\") that this Pharaoh \"cannot yet be identified on Manetho's list.\" It is also impossible to decide whether the alliance was first sought by Solomon with a view to win over a powerful and dangerous neighbour (Thenius), to whose inroads his northern border was exposed, and especially to counteract the influence (1 Kings 11:21) of Hadad (Plumptre), or whether the marriage was proposed by Pharaoh because the 21st dynasty \"had then become very weak\" (Rawlinson) and its head desired \"friendly relations with the kingdom of Israel, which had grown into a power to be dreaded\" (Keil). But we may reasonably suppose that the alliance \"must have been to most Israelites a very startling one\" (Plumptre.) Egypt (Rahab, Psalm 89:10; Isaiah 51:9) was to every Israelite a name both of triumph and dread. The Pharaohs were their ancestral foes], and took Pharaoh's daughter [A marriage such as this was not without precedent (Genesis 41:45; Exodus 2:21; Numbers 12:1; Matthew 1:5; Ruth 4:13), nor was it condemned by the Law, which only forbade intermarriage with the nations of Canaan (Exodus 34:16; Deuteronomy 7:3), and sanctioned the union of an Israelite with a captive taken in war (Deuteronomy 21:13; cf. 20:14). \"At the same time, it was only when the foreign wives renounced idolatry, that such marriages were in accordance with the spirit of the law\" (Keil). As Solomon at this period of his life faithfully observed the law, as he is never blamed for this marriage, and as there is no trace whatever of the introduction of Egyptian rites into Israel, it is a fair presumption that the Egyptian princess conformed to the religion of her adopted country], and brought her into the city of David [2 Chronicles 8:11 speaks of her dwelling in \"the house of David,\" i.e., it would seem, the palace which David had occupied] until he had made an end [this hardly shows that he had begun to build, as Keil infers. He did not begin building the Temple until the fourth (1 Kings 6:1), nor his own house until the eleventh year (1 Kings 7:1) after his accession, and the marriage, though not at the very commencement of his reign, can hardly have been delayed to the eleventh year, and may have taken place before the death of Shimei] of building his own house [cf. 1 Kings 7:7] and the house of the Lord [cf. 1 Kings 6; 1 Kings 7:51] and the wall of Jerusalem round about. [Probably, he both strengthened and extended the city walls, as Josephus (Ant. 8:06.1) affirms. Acc. to the LXX. addition to ch. 12, it was on this task that Jeroboam was employed (1 Kings 11:27; cf. 9:15). David had fortified a part of the city (2 Samuel 5:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Only [The word perhaps signifies \"that there was one exception to the flourishing condition of things which the writer has been describing\" (Rawlinson), though the people are nowhere blamed for sacrificing on the high places, and Solomon's sacrifice at \"the great high place \"was full of blessing. The idea rather is that just as he was obliged to bring his Egyptian wife into the city of David, because his palace was not yet finished, so the people were compelled to sacrifice on the high places, because the temple was not yet built (Keil), and \"the place\" where God would put His name had only just been chosen (1 Chronicles 22:1)] the people sacrificed [Heb. were sacrificing, i.e., habitually, constantly] in high places [All nations have chosen hill tops for acts of worship, perhaps as being nearer heaven. \"Even Abraham built an altar to the Lord on a mountain near Bethel (Genesis 12:7, 8; cf. 22:2, 9; 31:54).\" And the use of high places for this purpose was not distinctly condemned in the Law. It is true the Hebrews were commanded to have but one place of sacrifice (Leviticus 17:9; Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 13, 26, 27; cf. Joshua 22:29), and this no doubt was, if not an indirect prohibition, a discouragement of such sanctuaries. It has been held, however, that this command was purely prospective, and it is certainly remarkable that even when the Israelites were settled in the promised land, and the tabernacle was set up (Joshua 18:1), altars were constantly built and sacrifices offered on high places, and sometimes, as in the case of Gideon (Judges 6:26), and Manoah (Judges 13:19, 20), by express Divine command. Later on we find Samuel (1 Samuel 7:9, 10; 1 Samuel 11:15; 1 Samuel 16:5), Saul (1 Samuel 13:9; 14:35), David (1 Chronicles 21:26), Solomon and Elijah (1 Kings 18:30), offering sacrifices in various places, which they could not possibly have done had it seemed to them that this was condemned beforehand by the Law. It is highly probable, therefore, that though the contemporaries of Joshua took a different view (as Joshua 22:15-31 proves), the men of a later age excused themselves on the ground stated in the text, that \"there was no house built unto the name of the Lord.\" It has been held by some that \"had they not sacrificed and burnt incense on high places, they could not have sacrificed or burnt incense at all\" (Bp. Horsley); but this seems to overlook the fact that there was one place provided for sacrifices - the door of the tabernacle — and that for some reason or other they sacrificed elsewhere. And the reason, no doubt, was the one assigned by the historian. It should be added that this term \"high place\" (בָּמָה) came to be used of all places of worship, not only on heights, but even those in valleys (2 Kings 17:9; Jeremiah 7:31; Jeremiah 32:35). The Bamah sometimes consisted of an altar only, but as a rule, there was a shrine or sanctuary, erected hard by (1 Kings 13:32; 2 Kings 17:29; 2 Kings 23:19), the Beth-Bamah, for which the word Bamah is sometimes loosely employed (1 Kings 11:7; 1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 21:3)], because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord until those days.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And Solomon loved the Lord [thus keeping the first and great commandment, the \"Shema Israel\" (Deuteronomy 6:5; cf. Deuteronomy 30:16; Matthew 22:37; Luke 10:27)], walking in the statutes of David his father [i.e., those which David had kept (verses 6,14) and commanded him to keep (ch. 1 Kings 2:4)]: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. [These words clearly show that the worship of the high places, although condoned, and indeed accepted, by God (ver. 5) was not strictly lawful and right. It was an ignorance that God winked at. The historian, remembering what the worship of the high places became, notices this as an imperfection of Solomon's early reign, though he does not say that such worship was sinful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And the king went to Gibeon [Joshua 9:3; Joshua 10:2; Joshua 18:25; Joshua 21:17; 2 Samuel 21:1. Now known as El-Jib, a commanding eminence (as the name implies) some six miles north of Jerusalem. Strictly, it consists of two heights, on one of which, it is conjectured, the town stood, while the other was the high place. Solomon was accompanied to Gibeon by \"all the congregation,\" including the captains, judges, governors, etc. (2 Chronicles 1:2, 3] to sacrifice there [This religious service was designed to inaugurate his reign (2 Chronicles 1:13), after the precedent of 1 Samuel 11:15; cf. 2 Samuel 6:2. His object was also to supplicate the Divine blessing on his undertakings. If his visit served at the same time as a farewell, or \"honourable funeral to the tabernacle\" (Wordsw.) this was an accident]; for that was the great high place [being the place of the tabernacle and brazen altar. In 1 Samuel 21:6 we find the tabernacle at Nob, though without the ark (1 Samuel 4:2). After the massacre of the priests it lost the ephod (1 Samuel 22:20; 1 Samuel 23:6). It could hardly remain in a spot stained by so much blood; but how or when it found its way to Gibeon, we do not know. See 1 Chronicles 16:37, 39; 2 Chronicles 1:3-6]: a thousand burnt offerings [such numbers were not infrequent at festivals. See on 1 Kings 8:62, and cf. 2 Chronicles 29:33, 34. Rawlinson reminds us that \"Xerxes offered 1000 oxen at Troy\" (Herod. 7:43).] did Solomon offer [not, of course, personally, as some (Ewald. e.g.) have sup. posed. He is said to have \"offered\" them, because he (together with the congregation, perhaps) provided them. The immense number alone shows that he cannot have offered in person. The festival probably lasted for seven or eight days,but even then a thousand victims can hardly have been offered whole (עֹלות) unless the altar was greatly enlarged, or additional temporary altars were erected. This latter supposition is not negatived by the next words.

It is just possible, as Thenius maintains, that the narrative was handed down to a succeeding age by tradition, and was not incorporated into any of the documents from which our historian compiled his narrative; but this argues nothing against its authenticity or its inspiration.

[It is somewhat difficult to account for the pertinacious claim to the child, preferred even before the king by the pretended mother. The most probable explanation is, that having taken the child in the first instance on the spur of the moment, in order to avoid the reproach of having killed her offspring by her clumsiness and neglect, she found it difficult to draw back from her false position - which indeed she could not do without owning herself both child stealer and liar - and so she put on a bold face and maintained the imposture even before the monarch himself. That she did not really care for the child is evident from ver. 26.] Thus they spake [Heb. \"And they spake,\" i.e., affirmed and contradicted] before the king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Then [promptly, without hesitation] said the king, The one saith [Heb. \"this is saying,\" i.e., keeps saying] This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead; and the other saith, Nay, but thy son is the dead and my son is the living.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king said, Bring me a sword.

[The Hebrew is strikingly concise, \"divide.\" We have here by far the greatest difficulty in the story. When the pretender, who has clamoured for the child, is at last offered it by its mother, she refuses the gift and heartlessly urges that it shall be cut in two. We can only account for her strange conduct on the supposition that. she caught eagerly at any way of escape from the dilemma in which she had placed herself, and thought, no doubt, that to accept his decision would be to flatter and please the king.

[Most of the commentators cite from Grotius, the familiar story found in Diodorus Siculus, of Ariopharnes, king of Thrace. Three youths claimed before this king each to be the son, and therefore successor, of a deceased king of the Cimmerians.

Cf. 2 Samuel 8:15-18, and 2 Sam 20:23-26] which he had, Azariah the son [i.e., descendant, probably grandson. See on 1 Chronicles 6:10] of Zadok the priest. [We are here confronted by two questions of considerable difficulty. First, to whom does the title \"priest\" here belong, to Azariah or to Zadok? Second, what are we to understand by the term, a spiritual, or a more or less secular person - ἱερεύς or βουλευτής? As toNEWLINENEWLINE1. the Vulgate (sacerdotis) and apparently the Authorized Version, with the Rabbins, Luther, and many later expounders, connect the title with Zadok (who is mentioned as priest in ver. 4), and understand that Azariah, the son of the high priest Zadok, was, together with the sons of Shisha, one of the scribes (ver. 3). It is true that this view obviates some difficulties, but against it are these considerations.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The accents.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The Chaldee and LXX. (ὁ ἱερεύς Cod. Alex.; Cod. Vat. omits the words) Versions.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Hebrew usage, according to which the patronymic is regarded as almost parenthetical.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) The fact that in every other case in this list the title is predicate nominative (vers. 3-6).NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The position of Azariah's name, first in the list - a position which would hardly be assigned to a scribe.NEWLINENEWLINE(6) The absence of any copula (ו), which, it is submitted, would be required if Azariah and the sons of Shisha alike were scribes. The question is one of some nicety, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour of connecting the title with Azariah, i.e., \"Azariah son of Zadok was the priest.\" This brings us toNEWLINENEWLINE2. What are we to understand by \"the priest \" - הַכֹּהֵן? It is urged by Keil, Bahr, al. that this cannot mean \"priest\" in the ordinary sense of the word, still less \"high priest,\" for the following reasons:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) Because the high priests of Solomon are mentioned presently, viz., Abiathar and Zadok, and the Jews never had three high priests.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Because the Azariah who was high priest under Solomon for the words of 1 Chronicles 6:10, \"He it is that executed the priest's office,\" etc, must belong to the Azariah of ver. 9, and have got accidentally misplaced - was the son of Ahimaaz, not of Zadok.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Because no grandson of Zadok could then be old enough to sustain the office of high priest.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) Because in one passage (2 Samuel 8:18, compared with 1 Chronicles 18:17) כֹּהֲנִים is used of privy councillors and of the sons of David, who cannot have been sacrificing priests. Keil consequently would understand that Azariah was \"administrator of the kingdom, or prime minister.\" Similarly Bahr. But in favour of the ordinary meaning of the word are these powerful considerations:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) All the versions translate the word by \"priest,\" i.e., they understand by the term a spiritual person.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) Whatever may be the case with כֹּהֵן, הַכֹּהֵן, \"the priest\" (par excellence) can only be understood of the high priest (ch. 1:8, 38; Exodus 29:30; Leviticus 21:21; 2 Kings 11:9, 15; 2 Kings 22:4, 8, 10, 12, 14. Comp. 2 Chronicles 26:17).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It is extremely doubtful whether כֹּהֵן is ever used except in the sense of ἱερεύς, Rawlinson, who says it sometimes indicates \"a civil officer, with perhaps a semi-priestly character,\" refers to Gesenius sub hac voce, who, however, distinctly affirms that the word only means priest, and accounts for the application of the term to the sons of David (2 Samuel 8:18) on the supposition that the Jews had priests who were not of the tribe of Levi. The question is discussed with great learning by Professor Plumptre (Dict. Bib., art. \"Priest\"), who suggests that \"David and his sons may have been admitted, not to distinctively priestly functions, such as burning incense (Numbers 16:40; 2 Chronicles 26:18), but to an honorary, titular priesthood. To wear the ephod in processions (2 Samuel 6:14) at the time when this was the special badge of the order (1 Samuel 22:18), to join the priests and Levites in their songs and dances, might have been conceded, with no deviation from the Law, to the members of the royal house.\" There is one difficulty however in the way of accepting this ingenious and otherwise sufficient explanation, namely, that it seems hardly likely that the title of priest would be freely accorded by Hebrew writers to men who were expressly excluded from all \"distinctively priestly functions,\" especially after the use of the same word in the preceding verse (17) to designate the high priest. And I venture to suggest that the discharge by David's sons of the semi-priestly functions just referred to occasioned so much remark as to head to the application of the term \"priest\" to them in a special conventional sense; in fact, that it became a sort of soubriquet, which rather implied that they were not priests than that they were. (Notice the order of 2 Samuel 8:18, Hebrews) And observeNEWLINENEWLINE(4) if we are to understand by \"the priest\" in ver. 2, \"prime minister;\" by \"priests\" in ver. 4, \"high priests,\" and by \"priest\" in ver 5, \"principal officer,\" language has no certain meaning.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The mention of Azariah as \"the priest\" in the same list with Zadok and Abiathar is easily accounted for. We know that Abiathar was deposed at the beginning of Solomon's reign (1 Kings 2:27), and Zadok must then have been an old man. Their names consequently are recorded (ver. 4) because they were high priests for a brief period of the reign, but Azariah is mentioned first as \"the priest\" because he was high priest during most of the time.NEWLINENEWLINE(6) \"Azariah the son of Zadok\" is quite compatible with the fact that Azariah was really the son of Ahimaaz. בֵּן is constantly used in the sense of \"descendant,\" and especially \"grandson.\" (Genesis 29:5: 31:28, 55: and see on ch. 2:8,\"the son of Gera.\") Zadok is no doubt mentioned as better known than Ahimaaz, and probably because Azariah succeeded him directly in the office.NEWLINENEWLINE(7) The age of Azariah must be uncertain, and Solomon's reign was a long one.NEWLINENEWLINE(8) The position of his name - first - accords well with the idea that he was high priest, which I conclude that he was. It is worthy of remark that in the lists of David the military officers of the kingdom occupy the first place; in those of Solomon, the civil and religious dignitaries. \"The princes of Solomon are, with one exception (ver. 4) ministers of peace.\" - Wordsworth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha [probably the same person who is mentioned in 2 Samuel 20:25 as Sheva; in 2 Samuel 8:17, as Seraiah; and in 1 Chronicles 18:16, as Shavsha, David's scribe. The office thus descended from father to sons. The variations in this name are instructive.

Theodoret remarks quite truly, τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀφείλατο οὐ τῆς ἱερωσύνης ἐγύμνωσεν, and similarly Grotius.

Keil and Bahr pronounce somewhat positively that this Nathan is not the prophet of that name, but Nathan the son of David (2 Samuel 5:14; Luke 3:31). It is quite impossible to decide with certainty which is meant, if either, though Zechariah 12:12 undoubtedly favours the supposition that the latter is here intended] was over the officers [the twelve prefects mentioned in vers. 7 sqq.]: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer [Heb. priest, Vulg. sacerdos. Singularly, as before, the LXX. (Vat.) omits the word. The expression can hardly mean \"the son of Nathan the priest,\" but it may either signify that \"Zabud ben Nathan, a priest, was king's friend,\" or that (as in the A. V.) he was a priest and king's friend. But the former is every way preferable. I find it easier to believe that the true import of 2 Samuel 8:18 the passage which is cited (sometimes along with 2 Samuel 20:26, where the LXX., however, has ἱερεύς) to prove that there were secular \"priests\" - is not yet understood, than to hold (with Gesenius, Ewald, etc.), that there were sacrificing priests who were not of the sons of Aaron (cf. 2 Chronicles 26:18), or that the word כּהֵן, the meaning of which was thoroughly fixed and understood, can have been familiarly applied, except in the strictly conventional way already indicated, to lay persons], and [omit] the king's friend.

Curiously enough, the Havoth Jair are mentioned in connexion with each (see Numbers 32:41; Deuteronomy 3:4, 5, 14; Joshua 13:30; 1 Chronicles 2:22; Judges 10:4), but in every ease except the last the reference is to the son of Segub. As the judge was probably one of his descendants, it is not surprising that the judge's sons should possess some of the villages of Jair], which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region [חֶבֶל, lit., measuring cord, came to signify the region measured] of Argob [elsewhere \"the Argob,\" i.e., the stony. This is the region subsequently known as Trachonitis, now called the Lejah. It is distinguished here and in Joshua 13:30, and 1 Chronicles 2:22 from the Gileadite district just mentioned, with which it is sometimes confounded. Both seem to have been conquered by Jair, but the towns of the former bore the name of Havoth Jair and these of Bashan Havoth Jair. Cf. Deuteronomy 3:4, 5, 14 with Numbers 32:41. The latter consisted of threescore cities, with walls, gates, and bars. This remarkable district, twenty-two miles in length by fourteen in breadth, is \"wholly composed of black basalt, which appears to have issued from innumerable pores in the earth in a liquid state .... Before cooling, its surface was violently agitated, and it was afterwards shattered and rent by convulsions .... Strange as it may seem, this ungainly and forbidding region is thickly studded with deserted cities and villages\" (Porter, \"Giant Cities of Bashan,\" also in Kitto's Cycl. 3. p. 1032; Dict.

Psalm 135:11; Psalm 136:19, 20]; and he was the only officer which was in the land. [This cannot mean \"the only officer in Gilead,\" notwithstanding the great extent of territory - the usual interpretation - for that would contradict vers. 13, 14. Nor can can it mean the only officer in his district, or portion, of Gilead, for that is self-evident, and the remark would apply equally to all the other prefects. And we are hardly justified in translating נְצִיב אֶחָד \"he was the first (i.e., superior), officer\" (set over those mentioned above, vers. 13, 14), as Schulze. סך אֶחָד used as an ordinal number, but it is only in connexion with days and years (Gesen. s.v.) Some, following the LXX. (εῖς ἐν γῇ Ἰούδα) would detach Judah from ver. 20, where it must be allowed it occurs with a suspicious abruptness, and where the absence of the copula, so usual in the Hebrew, suggests a corruption of the text, and would connect it with this verse, which would then yield the sense, \"and he was,\" (or \"there was\") \"one officer which purveyed in the land of Judah.\" it is to be observed, however, that though no mention has as yet been made of Judah in any of the districts, yet the prefecture of Ben Hesed (ver. 10) appears to have extended over this tribe, and the remark consequently seems superfluous. (Can it be the object of the writer to show that the royal tribe was not favoured or exempted from contributing its share?) On the whole, the difficulty would seem still to await a solution. We can hardly, in the teeth of ver. 7, suppose with Ewald, al. that a thirteenth officer is here intended.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:20-34.

What the presents were we are told 1 Kings 10:25, where, however, see note], and served Solomon all the days of his life. The daily consumption of the royal household is now related to show the grandeur and luxury of the court. And it agreed well with the greatness of the kingdom. The lavish provision of Oriental palaces was evidently a subject of wonder and of boasting to the ancients, as the inscriptions and monuments show.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And Solomon's provision [marg. bread, but לֶחֶם, strictly signifies any kind of food] for one day was thirty measures [Heb. cots. The כֹּר was both a liquid and a dry measure (ch. 5:11) and was the equivalent to the homer (Ezekiel 45:14), but its precise capacity is doubtful. According to Josephus, it contained eighty-six gallons; according to the Rabbins, forty-four] of fine flour and threescore measures of meal. [Thenius calculates that this amount of flour would yield 28,000 lbs. of bread, which (allowing 2 lbs. to each person) would give 14,000 as the number of Solomon's retainers. This computation, however, could have but little value did not his calculations, based on the consumption of flesh, mentioned presently (allowing 1.5 lbs. per head), lead to the same result.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTen fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ten fat [Heb. fatted, i.e., for table] oxen, and twenty fat oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts and roebucks [or gazelles] and fallowdeer [Roebucks.

But here it must obviously mean on the west side, for Solomon's rule did not extend east of the Euphrates. The use of this word in this sense (Joshua 5:1; Joshua 9:1; Joshua 12:7; 1 Chronicles 26:30; Ezra 8:36; Nehemiah 2:7) is generally accounted for on the supposition that the writers were living in Babylon in the time of the captivity; but this appears to be by no means certain. (See, e.g., Ezra 4:10, 11.) The truth seems to be, not that \"the expression belonged to the time of the captivity, but was retained after the return and without regard to its geographical signification, just, for instance, like the expression, Gallia Trans-alpina\" (Bahr), but that from the first it was employed, now of one side, now of the other, of the Jordan; of the west in Genesis 1:10, 11; Joshua 9:1, etc.; of the east in Numbers 22:1; Numbers 32:32; \"and even in the same chapter is used first of one and then of the other Deuteronomy 3:8, 20, 25\" (Spk. Comm. on Deuteronomy 1:1), and that it was subsequently applied, with similar variations of meaning, to the Euphrates. See Introduction, sect. 5.] from Tiphsah [cf. 2 Kings 15:16, apparently the town on the west bank of the Euphrates, known to the Greeks as Thapsacus. It derived its name from the fact that the river at that point was fordable פָּסַח = pass over; תִּפְסַה = crossing. A bridge of boats was maintained here by the Persians. It was here that the river was forded by Cyrus and the Ten Thousand, and was crossed by the armies of Darius Codomannus and Alexander] to Azzah [i.e., Gaza, now called Guzzeh, the southernmost city of Philistia, ten miles from the Mediterranean, and the last town in Palestine on the Egyptian frontier.

Cf. 1 Samuel 6:16; 2 Samuel 8:3-10; 1 Kings 20:1. The \"kings on this side the river\" were those of Syria (2 Samuel 8:6. Cf. 10:19) conquered by David, and of Philistia, 2 Samuel 8:1]: and he had peace on all sides [Heb. from all his servants] round about him [in fulfilment of 1 Chronicles 22:9. The objection of Thenius that this statement contradicts that of ch. 11:23, sqq., is hardly deserving of serious notice.

[A proverbial expression (see 2 Kings 18:31, where it is used by Rabshakeh; Micah 4:4; Zechariah 3:10) to denote rest and the undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, not necessarily, as Keil, \"the most costly products of the land.\" In invasions, raids, etc., it is still the custom of the East to cut and carry off all the crops, and fruits. Wordsworth notices that the vine often\" clustered on the walls of houses (Psalm 128:3), or around and over the courtyards\", from Dan even to Beersheba [i.e., from the extreme northern to the extreme southern (not eastern, as the American translator of Bahr) boundary, Judges 20:1; 1 Samuel 3:20; 2 Samuel 3:10].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses [40,000 is certainly a clerical error, probably for 4000 (i.e., אַרְבָּיעים for אַרְבָּעָה). ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) in the parallel passage in Chronicles the number is stated as 4000.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) 4000 agrees, and 40,000 does not, with the other numbers here given.NEWLINENEWLINEThe chariots, e.g., numbered 1400; the horsemen 12,000. Now for 1400 chariots the proper allowance of horses would be about 4000. We see from the monuments that it was customary to yoke two horses (seldom three) to a chariot; but a third or supernumerary horse was provided to meet emergencies or accidents. 4000 horses would hence be a liberal provision for Solomon's chariots, and it would also agree well with the number of his cavalry. 12,000 cavalry and 40,000 chariot horses are out of all proportion. As to stalls, it seems clear that in ancient, as in modern times, each horse had a separate crib (Vegetins in Bochart, quoted by Keil). Gesenius, however, understands by אֻרְות, not stalls, but teams, or pairs] for his chariots [or chariotry: the word is singular and collective] and twelve hundred horsemen [rather, horses, i.e., riding or cavalry, as distinguished from chariot horses above. See note on 1 Kings 1:5. It has been supposed that this warlike provision is mentioned to account for the peace (\"si vis pacem, para bellum\") of Solomon's reign, and was designed to overawe the tributary kings. But it is more probable that the idea of the historian was, partly to exhibit the pomp and circumstance of Israel's greatest king, and partly to record a contravention of the law (Deuteronomy 17:16), which was one of the precursors of his fall].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And those [rather, these, i.e., the officers mentioned vv. 7-19] officers provided victual for [Heb. nourished] king Solomon and for all that came unto king Solomon's table [we can hardly see here (with Keil) \"a further proof of the blessings of peace.\" The words were probably suggested by the mental wonder how the cavalry, etc., could be maintained, and so the author states that this great number of horses and horsemen depended on the twelve purveyors for their food] every man in his month; they lacked nothing [rather, suffered nothing to be lacking.

It is true that the land of the Beni-Kedem is identified with Haran or Mesopotamia (Genesis 29:1), and the mountains of Kedem (Numbers 23:7) are evidently those of Aram. It is also true that \"the children of the East\" are apparently distinguished from the Amalekites and Midianites (Judges 6:8, 33; Judges 7:12; Judges 8:10). It is probable, nevertheless, that the name is here employed to designate all the Arabian tribes east and southeast of Palestine - Sabaeans, Idumeans, Temanites, Chaldeans. What their wisdom was like, we may see in the Book of Job. Cf. Jeremiah 49:7; Obadiah 1:8] and all the wisdom of Egypt. [The learning of Egypt was of great repute in the Old World. It differed very considerably from the wisdom of Kedem, being scientific rather than gnomic (Isaiah 19:11, 12; Isaiah 31:2, 8; Acts 7:22) and including geometry, astronomy, magic, and medicine.

The resemblance is certainly remarkable. Not only are the names practically the same (Dara may well be a clerical error: many MSS., together with the Syr. and Arab., read Darda), but they occur in the same order. Our first impression, consequently, is that the two lists represent the same persons, and if so, these four sages were the \"sons\" of Zerah, the son of Judah (Genesis 38:30). But against this it is urged that Ethan is here called the Ezrahite, as are both Ethan and Heman in the titles of Psalm 89, and 88. respectively. The resemblance, however, of Ezrahite (אֶזְרָתִי) to Zerahite (זַרְתִי) is so close as to suggest identity rather than difference. There is, perhaps, more weight in the objection that Chalcol and Darda are here distinctly said to be \"the sons of Mahol,\" though here again it has been observed that Mahol (מָחול) means pipe or dance, and the \"sons of Mahol,\" consequently, may merely be a synonym, agreeably to Eastern idiom (Ecclesiastes 12:4, with which cf. 2 Samuel 19:35), for \"musicians.\" We may therefore allow that the four names may be those of sons (i.e., descendants) of Zerah. But the question now presents itself: Are Ethan and Heman to be identified with the well known precentors of David? Against their identity are these facts:NEWLINENEWLINE1. That Ethan the singer (1 Chronicles 6:31) is described as the son of Kishi (1 Chronicles 6:44), elsewhere called Kushaiah (1 Chronicles 15:17), and of the family of Merari; as a Levite that is, instead of a descendant of Judah, and that Heman, who is called the singer, or musician (1 Chronicles 6:33), and the \"king's seer\" (1 Chronicles 25:5) is said to be a son of Joel, a grandson of the prophet Samuel, and one of the Kohathite Levites (1 Chronicles 15:17). The first impression in this case, therefore, is that they must be distinct. But it should be rememberedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the sons - in the strict sense - of Zerah are nowhere else named for their wisdom, whereas the royal singer and seer probably owed their appointments to their genius, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that though Levites, they may have been incorporated (possibly like Jair, through marriage - see note on ver. 13 above, and cf. Ezra 2:61) into the tribe of Judah.

It must be admitted, however, that the natural interpretation of 1 Chronicles 2:6 is that the \"sons\" of Zerah there mentioned were his immediate and actual descendants, and not Levites who long centuries afterwards were somehow incorporated into his family.

Menander states that the building of the temple was commenced in the twelfth year of Hiram's reign, which lasted 34 years (Jos. Ant. 8:03.1; Contr. Ap. 1:18). Hiram is further said to have married his daughter to Solomon and to have engaged with him in an intellectual encounter which took the shape of riddles] king of Tyre [Heb. צור, rock, so called because of the rocky island on which old Tyro was built, sometimes called מִבְצַר לֺצר, the fortress of, or fortified Tyro (Joshua 19:29; 2 Samuel 24:7, etc.) The capital of Phoenicia. In earlier times, Sidon would seem to have been the more important town; hence the Canaanites who inhabited this region were generally called Zidonians, as in ver. 6] sent his servants [legatos, Vatablus] unto Solomon [The Vat. LXX. has here a strange reading, \"To anoint Solomon,\" etc. The object of this embassy was evidently to recognize and congratulate the youthful king (the Syriac has a gloss, \"and he blessed him,\" which well represents one object of the embassy) and at the same time to make overtures of friendship. An alliance, or good understanding, with Israel was then, as at a later period (Acts 12:20) of great importance to them of Tyre and Sidon. Their narrow strip of seaboard furnished no corn lands, so that their country depended upon Israel for its nourishment]; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of David his father [i.e., he had heard of the death of David and the accession of Solomon; possibly of the events narrated in chap. 1.]: for Hiram was ever [Heb. all the days: i.e., of their reigns; so long as they were contemporary sovereigns] a lover of David.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Solomon sent to Hiram.

The account of 2 Chronicles 2, which as a rule is more detailed than that of the Kings, begins here. It does not notice, that is to say, the prior embassy of the Phoenician king, as the object of the chronicler is merely to narrate the measures taken for the erection of the temple], saying [The return embassy gave Solomon the opportunity to ask for the timber, etc., that he desired.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house [Hiram could not fail to know this, as his relations with David had been close and intimate. Not only had he \"sent cedar trees and carpenters and masons\" to build David's house (2 Samuel 5:11), but \"they of Tyro brought much cedar wood to David\" (1 Chronicles 22:4) for the house of the Lord] unto the name of the Lord [i.e., to be dedicated to the Lord as His shrine and habitation (cf. Deuteronomy 12:5, 11; and ch. 8:18, 19, 20, etc.)] for the wars [Heb., war. As we have singular noun and plural verb, Ewald, Rawlinson, al. assume that war stands for adversaries, as the next clause seems to imply. Bahr and Keil, however, with greater reason, interpret, \"for the war with which they surrounded him;\" a construction (סָבַב with double accusative) which is justified by Psalm 109:3] until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet [until, i.e., He trampled them down. The same image is found in some of David's psalms, e.g., Psalm 7:5; Psalm 60:12; cf.

He thus gives Hiram to understand that he is carrying out his father's plans, and plans which had the Divine sanction, and that this is no fanciful project of a young prince], Thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an [Heb. the] house unto my name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon [Heb. the Lebanon, i.e., the White (so. mountain). \"It is the Merit Blanc of Palestine\" (Porter); but whether it is so called because of its summits of snow or because of the colour of its limestone is uncertain. Practically, the cedars are now found in one place only, though Ehrenberg is said to have found them in considerable numbers to the north of the road between Baalbek and Tripoli. \"At the head of Wady Kadisha there is a vast recess in the central ridge of Lebanon, some eight miles in diameter. Above it rise the loftiest summits in Syria, streaked with perpetual snow... In the very centre of this recess, on a little irregular knoll, stands the clump of cedars\" (Ibid., Handbook, 2 p. 584), over 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. It would seem as if that part of Lebanon where the cedars grew belonged to Hiram's dominion. \"The northern frontier of Canaan did not reach as far as Bjerrsh\" (Keil), where the cedar grove is now. The idea of some older writers that the cedars belonged to Solomon, and that he only asked Hiram for artificers (\"that they hew me cedar trees,\" etc.) is negatived by ver. 10. It is true that \"all Lebanon\" was given to Israel (Joshua 13:5), but they did not take it. They did not drive out the Zidonians (ver. 6; Judges 1:31) or possess\" the land of the Giblites\" (ver. 5; Judges 3:3). It should be stated here, however, that the cedar of Scripture probably included other varieties than that which now, alone bears the name (see on ver. 8)], and my servants shall be with Shy servants [i.e., sharing and lightening the work]: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants [Solomon engaged to pay and did pay both Hiram and his subjects for the services of the latter, and he paid both in kind. See below, on ver. 11] according to all that thou shalt appoint [This would seem to have been 20,000 measures of wheat and 20 measures of pure oil annually, ver. 11]: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill [Heb. knoweth, same word as before] to hew timber like unto the Zidonlans [Propter vicina nemora. Grotius, Sidou (Heb. צִידון), means \"fishing.\" See note on ver. 18. By profane, as well as sacred writers, the Phoenicians are often described by the name Zidonians, no doubt for the reason mentioned in the note on ver. 1. See Homer, Iliad 6:290; 23. 743; Odys. 4:84, 618; 17:4.24. Cf. Virg. AEn. 1. 677, 678; 4:545, etc. Genesis 10:15; Judges 1:31; Judges 3:3; 1 Kings 11:1, 33, etc. \"The mechanical skill of the Phoenicians generally, and of the Zidonians in particular, is noticed by many ancient writers,\" Rawlinson, who cites instances in his note. But what deserves especial notice here is the fact that the Zidonians constructed their houses of wood, and were celebrated from the earliest times as skilful builders. The fleets which the Phoenicians constructed for purposes of commerce would ensure them a supply of clever workmen. Wordsworth aptly remarks on the part the heathen thus took in rearing a temple for the God of Jacob. Cf. Isaiah 60:10, 13.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And It came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon [reported by his ambassadors], that he rejoiced greatly [see note on ver. 1. The continuance of the entente cordiale was ensured], and said, Blessed be the Lord [In 2 Chronicles 2:12, \"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel that made heaven and earth.\" We are not warranted by the expression of the text in concluding that Hiram believed in the exclusive divinity of the God of Israel, or \"identified Jehovah with Melkarth his god\" (Rawlinson), much less that he was proselyte to the faith of David and Solomon. All that is certain is that he believed the Jehovah as God was quite compatible with the retention of a firm faith in Baa1 and Astarte. It is also possible that he here adopts a language which he knew would be acceptable to Solomon, or the historian may have given us his thoughts in a Hebrew dread It is noticeable that the LXX. has simply εὐλογητὸς ὁ θεὸς] which hath given unto David a wise son [Compare 1 Kings 1:48; 1 Kings 2:9. The proof of wisdom lay in Solomon's fulfilling his wise father's purposes, and in his care for the worship of God. \"Wise,\" however, is not used here in the sense of \"pious,\" as Bahr affirms. In Hiram's lips the word meant discreet, sagacious. He would hardly recognize the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom] over this great people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And Hiram sent to Solomon [in writing, 2 Chronicles 2:11. It is instructive to remember in connexion with this fact that, according to the universal belief of antiquity, the use of letters, i.e., the art of writing, was communicated to the Greeks by the Phoenicians. Gesenius, indeed, holds that the invention of letters is also due to them. See the interesting remarks of Mr. Twisleton, Dict. Bib. 2. pp. 866-868], saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest unto me for [Heb. heard the things (i.e., message) which thou sentest unto me]: and I will do all thy desire concerning [Heb. in, i.e., as to] timber [or trees] of cedar [Heb. cedars] and timber of fir [Heb. trees of cypresses. This is, perhaps, the proper place to inquire what. trees are intended by the words אֶרֶז, and בְּרושׁ, here respectively translated\" cedar\" and \"fir.\" As to the first, it is impossible to restrict the word to the one species (Pinus cedrus or Cedrus Libani) which is now known as the cedar of Lebanon, or, indeed, to any single plant. That the Cedrus Libani, one of the most magnificent of trees, is meant in such passages as Ezekiel 31, Psalm 92:12, etc., admits of no manner of doubt. It is equally clear, however, that in other passages the term \"cedar\" must refer to some other tree. In Numbers 19:6, and Leviticus 14:6, e.g., the juniper would seem to be meant. \"The cedar could not have been procured in the desert without great difficulty, but the juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus) is most plentiful there.\" (The \"cedar\" of our pencils, it may be remarked, is a kind of juniper - Juniperus Bermudiana.) In Ezekiel 27:5, \"they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make masts for thee,\" it is probable that the Pinus Halepensis, not, as was formerly thought, the Scotch fir (Pinus sylvestris), is intended. The Cedrus Libani appears to be indifferently adapted to any such purpose, for which, however, the Pinus Halepensis is eminently fitted. But in the text, as throughout ch. 5-8, the reference, it can hardly be doubted, is to the Cedrus Libani. It is true the wood of this species is neither beautiful nor remarkably durable. Dr. Lindley calls it the \"worthless, though magnificent cedar,\" but the former adjective, however true it may be of English-grown cedar, cannot justly be applied to the tree of the Lebanon mountain. The writer has some wood in his possession, brought by him from the Lebanon, and though it has neither fragrance nor veining, it is unmistakably a hard and resinous wood. And it should be remembered that it was only employed by Solomon in the interior of the temple, and was there, for the most part, overlaid with gold, and that the climate of Palestine is much less destructive than our own. There seems to be no sufficient reason, therefore, for rejecting the traditional and till recently universal belief that the Cedrus Libani was the timber chosen for the temple use. Mr. Houghton, in Smith's Dict. Bib., vol. 3. App. A. p. 40, who speaks of it \"as being κατ ἐξοχὴν, the firmest and grandest of the conifers,\" says at the same time that \"it has no particular quality to recommend it for building purposes; it was probably therefore not very extensively used in the construction of the temple.\" But no other tree can be suggested which better suits the conditions of the sacred narrative. The deodara, which has found favour with some writers, it is now positively stated, does not grow near the Lebanon. It may be added that, under the name of Eres, the yew was probably included. The timber used in the palaces of Nineveh, which was long believed to be cedar, is now proved to be yew (Dict. Bib., art. \"Cedar\"). However it is certain that אֶרֶז is a nomen generale which includes, at any rate, the pine, the cedar, and the juniper, in confirmation of which it may be mentioned that at the present day, \"the name arz is applied by the Arabs to all three\" (Royle, in Kitto's Cyclop., art. \"Eres\"). The Grove of Cedars now numbers about 450 trees, great and small. Of these about a dozen are of prodigious size and considerable antiquity, possibly carrying us back (as the natives think) to the time of Solomon. Their precise age, however, can only be a matter of conjecture. The identification of the \"fir\" is even more precarious than that of the cedar. Celsius would see in this the true cedar of Lebanon. Others identify it with the juniper (Juniperus excelsa) or with the Pinus Halepensis, but most writers (among whom are Keil and Bahr) believe the evergreen cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) to be intended. Very probably the name Berosh comprehended two or three different species, as the cypress, the juniper, and the savine. The first named grows even near the summits of the mountain. Bahr says it is inferior to cedar (but see above). According to Winer, it is well fitted for building purposes, as\" it is not eaten by worms, and is almost imperishable and very light.\" It is certainly of a harder and closer grain, and more durable than the Cedrus Libani. It shows the brevity of our account that Solomon has not mentioned his desire for \"fir\" as well as\" cedar.\" This is disclosed in Hiram's reply, and in the parallel passage of the chronicler. It is also to be noticed that in the text the request for materials is more prominently brought to view, while in Chronicles the petition is for workmen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMy servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - My servants shall bring them [No word in the Hebrew; \"Timber of Cedar,\" etc., must be supplied or understood from the preceding verse] down [It is generally a steep descent from the cedar grove, and indeed all the Lebanon district, to the coast] from Lebanon unto the sea [This must have been a great undertaking. The cedars are ten hours distant from Tripoli, and the road must always have been a bad one. (\"What a road it is for mortals. In some spots it seems to have been intended for mountain goats only ..... It winds up sublime glens, and zigzags up rocky acclivities, and passes over stone-strewn terraces,\" etc. (Porter, Handbook, p. 583.) To the writer it appeared to be the most rugged and dangerous road in Palestine. It is possible that the timber was collected and floated at Gebal (Biblus. See note on ver. 18). Beyrout, the present port of the Lebanon, is 27 hours distant via Tripoli. But cedars would then, no doubt, be found nearer the sea. And the ancients (as the stones of Baalbek, etc., prove) were not altogether deficient in mechanical appliances. The transport of cedars to the Mediterranean would be an easy undertaking compared with the carriage of them to Nineveh, and we know from the inscriptions that they were imported by the Assyrian kings] and I will convey them by sea in floats [Heb. \"I will make (or put) them rafts in the sea.\" This was the primitive, as it was the obvious, way, of conveying timber, among Greeks and Romans, as well as among Eastern races. The reader will probably have seen such rafts on the Rhine or other river] unto the place which thou shalt appoint [Heb. send] me [In 2 Chronicles 2:16, Hiram assumes that this place will be Joppa, now Yafo, the port of Jerusalem, and 40 miles distant from the Holy City. The transport over these 40 miles, also of most rugged and trying road, must have involved, if possible, a still greater toil than that from Lebanon to the sea] and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish [Heb. do, same word as in ver. 8, and probably used designedly - \"I will perform thy desire.., and thou shalt perform my desire.\" There shall be a strict quid pro quo] my desire, in giving food for my household [Hiram states in his reply in what shape he would prefer the hire promised by Solomon (ver. 6). The food for the royal household must be carefully distinguished from the food given to the workmen (2 Chronicles 2:10). The fact that 20,000 ears of wheat formed a part of each has led to their being confounded (e.g. in the marginal references). It is noticeable that when the second temple was built, cedar wood was again brought to Jerusalem, rid Joppa, in return for \"meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon\" (Ezra 3:7). The selection of food as the hire of his servants by Hiram almost amounts to an undesigned coincidence. Their narrow strip of cornland, between the roots of Lebanon and the coast - Phoenicia proper (\"the great plain of the city of Sidon,\" Josephus. Ant. 5:03, 1) is only 28 miles long, with an average breadth of one mile-compelled the importation of corn and oil. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:17) mentions wheat, honey, oil, and balm as exported from Palestine to the markets of Tyre. It has been justly remarked that the fact that Phoenicia was thus dependent upon Palestine for its breadstuffs explains the unbroken peace that prevailed between the two countries (Heeren. See Dict. Bib. if. p. 865).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - So Hiram gave [Heb. kept giving, supplied] Solomon cedar trees and fir [or cypress] trees, according to all his desire.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures [Heb. cots.

But he did not undertake to feed Hiram's entire court, but merely to make an adequate return for the timber and labour he received. And the consumption of fine flour in Solomon's household was only about 11,000 cors per annum] and twenty measures of pure oil [lit., beaten oil, i.e., such as was obtained by pounding the olives, when not quite ripe, in a mortar. This was both of whiter colour and purer flavour, and also gave a clearer light, than that furnished by the ripe olives in the press. See the authorities quoted in Bahr's Symbolik, 1. p. 419]: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year [probably so long as the building lasted or timber was furnished. But the agreement may have been for a still longer period.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the Lord gave [Can there be any reference to the repeated \"gave\" of the two preceding verses?] to Solomon wisdom, as he promised him (1 Kings 3:12) and there was peace [one fruit of the gift.

Covenants were ratified by the slaughter of victims, between the parts of which the contracting parties passed (Genesis 15:18; Jeremiah 34:8, 18, 19). Similarly σπονδή, \"libation,\" in the plural, means \"league, truce,\" and σπονδὰς τέμνειν is found in classic Greek.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And King Solomon raised a levy [Marg., tribute of men, i.e., conscription] out of all Israel [i.e., the people, not the land - Ewald] and the levy was thirty thousand men. [That is, if we may trust the figures of the census given in 2 Samuel 24:9 (which do not agree, however, with those of 1 Chronicles 21:5), the conscription only affected one in forty of the male population. But even the lower estimate of Samuel is regarded with some suspicion. Such a levy was predicted (1 Samuel 8:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month, by courses [Heb. changes]: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home [they had to serve, that is to say, four months out of the twelve - no very great hardship], and Adoniram [see on 1 Kings 4:6; 12:18] was over the levy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains. [These 150,000, destined for the more laborious and menial works, were not Israelites, but Canaanites. We learn from 2 Chronicles 2:17, 18 that \"all the strangers that were in the land of Israel\" were subjected to forced labour by Solomon - there were, that is to say, but 150,000 of them remaining. They occupied a very different position from that of the 30,000 Hebrews. None of the latter were reduced to bondage (1 Kings 9:22), while the former had long been employed in servile work. The Gibeonites were reduced to serfdom by Joshua (Joshua 9:27), and the rest of the Canaanites as they were conquered (Joshua 6:10; Joshua 17:13; Judges 1:29, 30). In 1 Chronicles 22:2, we find some of them employed on public works by David. By the \"hewers\" many commentators have supposed that stonecutters alone are intended (so Jos., Ant., 8:02.9) partly because stone is mentioned presently, and partly because חָצַב is mostly used of the quarrying or cutting of stone, as in Deuteronomy 6:11; Deuteronomy 8:9; 2 Kings 12:12, etc. Gesenius understands the word both of stone and wood cutters. But is it not probable that the latter alone are indicated? That the word is sometimes used of woodcutting Isaiah 10:15 shows. And the words, \"in the mountain\" (בָּהָר) almost compel us so to understand it here. \"The mountain\" must be Lebanon. But surely the stone was not transported, to any great extent, like the wood, so great a distance over land and sea, especially when it abounded on the spot. (The tradition that the stone was quarried at Baalbek is quite unworthy of credence. It has no doubt sprung from the huge stones found there. \"The temple was built of the beautiful white stone of the country, the hard missal\" (Warren, p. 60.) It is true the number of wood cutters would thus appear to be very great, but it is to be remembered how few comparatively were the appliances or machines of those days: almost everything must be done by manual labour. And Pliny tells us that no less than 360,000 men were employed for twenty years on one of the pyramids. It is possible, however, that the huge foundations mentioned below (ver. 17) were brought from Lebanon.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Beside [without counting] the chief of Solomon's officers [Heb. the princes of the overseers, i.e., the princes who acted as overseers, principes qui praefecti erant (Vatabl.)] which were over the work three thousand and three hundred [This large number proves that the \"chiefs of the overseers\" cannot be meant. Were all the 3,300 superior officers, there must have been quite an army of subalterns. But we read of none. In 1 Kings 9:23, an additional number of 550 \"princes of the overseers\" (same expression) is mentioned, making a total of 3,850 superintendents, which agrees with the total stated in the Book of Chronicles. It is noteworthy, however, that the details differ from those of the Kings. In 2 Chronicles 2:17 we read of a body of 3,600 \"overseers to set the people a work,\" whilst in 1 Kings 8:10 mention is made of 250 \"princes of the overseers.\" These differences result, no doubt, from difference of classification and arrangement (J.H. Michaelis). In Chronicles the arrangement is one of race, i.e., 3,600 aliens גּרֵים; cf. 2 Chronicles 2:18) and 250 Israelites, whilst in Kings it is one of status, i.e., 3,300 inferior and 550 superior officers. It follows consequently that all the inferior and 300 of the superior overseers were Canaanites] which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And the king commanded and they brought [or cut out, quarried (Gesen.), as in Ecclesiastes 10:9; see also ch. 6:7 (Heb.) ] great stones, costly [precious, not heavy, as Thenius.

[Some of these great squared stones, we can hardly doubt, are found in situ at the present day. The stones at the south-east angle of the walls of the Haram (Mosque of Omar) are \"unquestionably of Jewish masonry\" (Porter, Handbook, p. 115). \"One is 23 2:9 in. long; whilst others vary from 17 to 20 feet in length. Five courses of them are nearly entire\" (ib.) As Herod, in rebuilding the edifice, would seem to have had nothing to do with the foundations, we may safely connect these huge blocks with the time of Solomon. It is also probable that some at least of the square pillars, ranged in fifteen rows, and measuring five feet each side, which form the foundations of the Mosque El Aksa, and the supports of the area of the Haram, are of the same date and origin (cf. Ewald, Hist. Israel, 3:233). Porter holds that they are \"coeval with the oldest part of the external walls.\" Many of them, the writer observed, were monoliths. The extensive vaults which they enclose are unquestionably \"the subterranean vaults of the temple area\" mentioned by Josephus (B.J. 5:3. 1), and the \"cavati sub terra montes\" of Tacitus.

For Gebal ( = mountain) see Joshua 13:5 (\"the land of the Giblites and Lebanon\"); Psalm 83:7 (\"Gebal and they of Tyro\"); and Ezekiel 27:9, where the LXX. translate the word Biblus, which was the Greek name of the city and district north of the famous river Adonis, on the extreme border of Phoenicia. It is now known as Jebeil. It has been already remarked that Tyre and Sidon, as well as Gebal, have Hebrew meanings. These are among the proofs of the practical identity of the Hebrew and Phoenician tongues. The Aramaean immigrants (Deuteronomy 26:5; Genesis 12:5) no doubt adopted the language of Canaan (Dict. Bib., art. \"Phoenicians\"). Keil renders, \"even the Giblites.\" He would understand, i.e., that the Zidonian workmen were Giblites; but this is doubtful. The Giblites are selected, no doubt, for special mention because of the prominent part they took in the work. Gebal, as its ancient and extensive ruins prove, was a place of much importance, and lying as it did on the coast, and near the cedar forests, would naturally have an important share in the cutting and shipping of the timber. Indeed, it is not improbable that it was at this port that the land transport ended, and the rafts were made. A road ran anciently from Gebal to Baalbak, so that the transport was not impracticable. But as the forests were probably of great extent, there may have been two or three depots at which the timber was floated] so they prepared timber [Heb. the timber] and stones [Heb. the stones] to build the house. [The LXX. (Vat. and Alex. alike) add here, \"three years.\" It is barely possible that these words may have dropped out of the text, but they look more like a gloss, the inference from the chronological statement of 1 Kings 6:1.]NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt [This date has been the subject of much controversy, which cannot even now be considered (pace Keil: \"The correctness of the number 480 is now pretty generally admitted\") as closed. Grave doubts are entertained as to its genuineness. Lord A. Hervey (Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 22) says it is \"manifestly erroneous.\" Rawlinson considers it to be \"an interpolation into the sacred text\" (p. 515). And it is to he observed,NEWLINENEWLINE1. that the LXX. reads 440 instead of 480 years - a discrepancy which is suspicious, and argues some amount of incertitude.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Origen quotes this verse without these words (Comm. in S. Johann 2:20).NEWLINENEWLINE3. They would seem to have been unknown to Josephus, Clem. Alex., and others.NEWLINENEWLINE4. It is not the manner of Old Testament writers thus to date events from an era, an idea which appears to have first occurred to the Greeks temp. Thucydides (Rawlinson). It is admitted that we have no other instance in the Old Testament where this is done.NEWLINENEWLINE5. It is difficult to reconcile this statement with other chronological notices both of the Old and New Testaments. For taking the numbers which we find in the Hebrew text of the books which refer to this period, they sum up to considerably more than 480 years. The time of the Judges alone comprises 410 years at the least. It should be stated, however, with regard to the chronology of the period last mentionedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that it only pretends to furnish round numbers - 20, 40, and the like - and evidently does not aim at exactitude;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that there is good ground for suspecting that the periods are not always consecutive; that in some cases, i.e., they overlap. We are not justified, therefore, because of the dates of the Judges in rejecting this statement. The question of New Testament chronology is somewhat more complicated. In Acts 13:20, St. Paul states the period between the division of Canaan, by Joshua (Joshua 14:1, 2), and the time of Samuel the prophet as 450 years (καί μετὰ ταῦτα ω}ς ἔτεσι τετρακοσίοις καὶ πεντήκοντα ἔδωκεν κριτὰς κ.τ.λ.) But Lachmann, on the authority of A, B, C (and we may add א), considers the received text to be corrupt, and would place καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα after πεντήκοντα. Alford, however, treats this reading as \"an attempt at correcting the difficult chronology of the verse,\" and says that \"all attempts to reconcile\" it with 1 Kings 6:1 \"are arbitrary and forced.\" If, then, the received text is to stand - and it is to be noticed that the reigns of the Judges, including Samuel, sum up exactly to the period mentioned by St. Paul, 450 years - the interval between the Exodus and the erection of the temple cannot well have been less than 99 or 100 years longer, i.e., 580 - Josephus makes it 592 - instead of 480 years.NEWLINENEWLINE6. The chronology of Josephus - to which by itself, perhaps, no great weight is to be attached, agrees with St. Paul's estimate, and of course contradicts that of the text.NEWLINENEWLINE7. Nor does it seem to be a valid argument for the retention of the suspected words, that \"the precision of the statement is a voucher for its accuracy.\" (Bahr, who adds, \"Not only is the whole number of the years given, but also the year of the reign of the king, and even the month itself,\" for the genuineness of the later date, \"In the fourth year,\" etc., is not questioned.) The remark of Keil that the building of the temple marked a new and important epoch in the history of the chosen people, and so justified an exceptional reference to the birth or emancipation of the nation, though undoubtedly true, will hardly avail much against the considerations alleged above. On the whole, therefore, I confess to the belief that these words are the interpolation of a later hand (of which we shall find traces elsewhere), though it would, perhaps, be premature, with only the evidence now before us, to exclude them from the text. It is certainly noteworthy that such destructive critics as Ewald and Thenius are satisfied as to their genuineness], in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel [according to the chronology of Ussher, this was A.M. 3000], in the month Zif [i.e., May. The word signifies splendour. The month was probably so called because of the brilliancy of its flowers (Gesen., Keil, al.)], which is the second month [This explanation is added because before the captivity the months (with the exception of Abib) appear to have had no regular names, but were almost always designated by numbers. (See, e.g., Genesis 7:11; 2 Kings 25:1). Only four pre-captivity names are recorded, and of these three are mentioned in connexion with the building of the temple, viz., Zif here and in ver. 37, Bul in ver. 38, and Ethanim in 1 Kings 8:2. It has hence been inferred that these names were not in general use, but were restricted to public documents, etc. (Dict. Bib. if. 416), a supposition which, if correct, would account for the facility with which the old appellations were superseded by post-captivity names. The later name for this month was Iyar (Targum on 2 Chronicles 30:2)], that he began [not in Heb.] to build the house of [Heb. to] the Lord. [The chronicler mentions the site (2 Chronicles 3:1), \"In Mount Moriah ....in the threshing floor of Ornan,\" etc. We know from the extensive foundations yet remaining that the preparation of the platform on which the temple should stand must have been a work of considerable time and labour, and see Jos., Ant. 8:03.9, and Bell. Jud. 5:05.1. We can hardly be wrong in identifying the remarkable rock known as the Sakrah, over which the mosque of Omar (Kubbet-es-Sakrah) is built - the \"pierced rock\" of the Jerusalem Itinerary - with the threshing floor of Ornan. The reader will find an interesting paper on the site of the temple in \"Scribner's Monthly,\" vol. 11. pp. 257-272. According to Mr. Beswick, whose measurements and conclusions it gives, the porch stood on the Sakrah. Mr. Conder, however, urges strong reasons (\"Tent Work,\" pp. 187-9) for placing the Holy of Holies on the rock. We should then \"see the Holy House in its natural and traditional position on the top of the mountain; we see the courts descending on either side, according to the present slopes of the hill; we find the great rock galleries dropping naturally into their right places; and finally, we see the temple, by the immutability of Oriental custom, still a temple, and the site of the great altar still consecrated [?] by the beautiful little chapel of the chain.\" But see Porteri. p. 125; Pal.

(אָמָהֹ) This unfortunately is by no means certain, as the Jews would seem to have had three different cubits. All the ancient measures, both Jewish and Gentile, were taken from parts of the body. Thus we find a \"finger-breadth\" (Jeremiah 52:21), \"hand-breadth\" (1 Kings 7:26), \"span\" (1 Samuel 17:24), and the Greeks had their δάκτυλος πούς and τῆχυς, and the Romans their cubitus, pes, digitus, etc. אָמָה is used in its proper sense (ulna) Deuteronomy 3:11. Probably at first it signified, like πῆχυς, the length from point of elbow to tip of little or middle finger. But it is obvious that this was an uncertain measure, and hence perhaps arose cubits of different length. According to Gesen. the cubit here mentioned, which was the older or sacred Mosaic cubit (2 Chronicles 3:3), was six palms, while that of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 40:5; Ezekiel 43:13), the royal Babylonian cubit, was seven, but on this as well as other points the authorities are very far from agreed. \"The length of the cubit is one of the most knotty points of Hebrew archaeology\" (Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1736). There is a general consensus of opinion, however in favour of understanding the cubit here mentioned as measuring 18 inches. Fergusson (Dict. Bib. 3:1451) considers this to be beyond question. It is certainly noteworthy that the measurements of Kings and Chronicles, of Ezra and Ezekiel, of Josephus and the Talmud, all agree, and we know that Josephus always uses the Greek cubit of 18 inches. Mr. Conder, however, maintains that the Hebrew cubit amounts to no more than sixteen inches. He says, \"Maimonides tells us that the temple cubit was of 48 barleycorns, and any one who will take the trouble to measure barleycorns, will find that three go to the inch\" - which gives 16 inches for the cubit. To this argument, which is not perhaps of much weight, he adds, what is of much greater moment, that \"the Galilean synagogues, measured by it, give round numbers\" (pp. 187-8)] and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. [It thus appears that the temple was but a small - compared with many churches, a very small - building. But its purpose and object must be considered. It was not for assemblies of the people. The congregation never met within it, but the worship was offered towards it. It was a place for the Holy Presence, and for the priests who ministered before it.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the porch [אוּלָם, forepart, projection (Vorhalle, Gesenius). The porch was not a colonnade - that is called a \"porch of pillars\" (1 Kings 7:6), but was formed By simply prolonging the side walls, and possibly the roof (see below). Bahr holds that it had only side walls and cieling (sic), and was entirely open in front; and the fact that no mention is made of any door or opening, though the doors of the other parts of the edifies are all referred to (vers. 8, 31, 33), certainly favours this view, as also does the position of the pillars of 1 Kings 7:21] before the temple of the house [The house, or main building (ver. 2), had two parts.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"The temple of the house\" (הֵיכָל = \"spacious,\" hence \"magnificent building,\" \"palace,\" as in Proverbs 30:28; Daniel 1:4. Gesen., Thes. 1:375). The same word is used of the tabernacle (1 Samuel 1:9), of the royal palace (1 Kings 21:1; 2 Kings 20:18; Psalm 45:8, 15), and of heaven (2 Samuel 22:7, etc.) This was the ναὸς par excellence, and is called \"the great house,\" because of its superior size and height, in 2 Chronicles 3:5.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The oracle (דְּבִיר) see on ver. 5. The two bore a rough resemblance to the nave and chancel of a Gothic church], twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house [The porch, i.e., extended across the entire front, or east end of the temple] and ten cubits was the breadth [i.e., depth] thereof before the house. [The height of the porch, of which no mention is made here, is stated in 2 Chronicles 3:4 as 120 cubits (say 180 feet), but there is surely some mistake in the figures. ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) This is \"unlike anything we know of in ancient architecture\" (Fergusson).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) A porch of such dimensions would surely have been called מִגְדָּל, not אוּלָם (Thenius, Keil).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It is doubtful whether an erection of so great a height, with such a slender basis, would stand. It would certainly be out of all proportion. Towers are generally built about three times the height of the adjoining nave, but this would be six times as high, and moreover the porch did not taper to a point like a Gothic spire. It is much more probable, therefore, that there is a corruption of the text of Chronicles (see on 2 Chronicles 3:4) - errors in numbers are by no means infrequent - than that such a column could be erected to serve as a porch, or if erected - and this consideration appears to me to be decisive - could have been passed over by our author without notice. It is impossible, however, to say positively what the height of the porch was. Probably 30 cubits, the height of the house. Stanley characteristically puts it down as \"more than 200 feet.\" It may be remarked here that Fergusson, following Josephus and the Talmud, contends that the temple had another building of the same height above it. See Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1456, and note on ver. 20.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for the house he made windows of narrow lights.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. [There has been much disputation over these words. The older expositors generally follow (as does the marg.) the Chaldee and Rabbins: \"windows broad within and narrow without;\" windows, i.e. somewhat like the loopholes of ancient castles. The windows of the temple would then have resembled those of Egyptian sacred buildings. (It is not implied that there was any conscious imitation of Egypt, though Fergusson surely forgets the affinity with Pharaoh (1 Kings 3:1), the trade with Egypt (1 Kings 10:28), and the favour with which some Egyptian fashions were regarded (Song of Solomon 1:9), when he contends that the chosen people would never take the buildings of their ancestral enemy for a model.) But this meaning is not supported by the original (שְׁקֻפִים אֲטֻמִים), the literal interpretation of which is \"closed beams\" (cf. chap. 7:4, 5), and which the most competent scholars now understand to mean \"closed or fixed lattices, i.e., the lattices or the temple windows were not movable, as in domestic architecture (2 Kings 1:2; 2 Kings 13, 17; Daniel 6:10).

The Orig. is יָצוּעַ (Keri, יָצִיעַ) singular = stratum (תךשׁארתס יָצַע, spread out). Symm. translates κατάστρωμα. Gesenius remarks that the word is used here and in ver. 10 in the masculine of the whole of the side structure, while in ver. 6 it is used in the feminine of the single stories. The floors bore this name, יָצוּע, because they were spread upon, not inserted into the walls. Rawlinson has evidently confounded this word with צֵלָע (see below) when he says, \"The Hebrew word here used would be best translated a lean to.\" Both words are translated alike \"chambers\" in the Authorized Version, but the first means stories or floors; the second may, perhaps, signify lean tos] round about, against [It is doubtful whether אֶת is here, as commonly, merely the sign of the accusative, or is the preposition \"with,\" meaning \"in connexion with,\" cum parietibus (Seb. Schmidt), in which case its meaning would approach very closely to that of עַל above. Bahr remarks that עַל and אֶת are used elsewhere as almost synonymous, and refers to Psalm 4:7 in connexion with Psalm 67:2. Keil translates, \"As for the walls\" (Anlangend die Wande), but this gives us an unfinished sentence. It is probably an accusative, explicative of the preceding clause = \"I mean the walls,\" etc., the singular, wall, having being used above. This additional clause] the walls of the house round about [would then mean that the term \"house\" is to be understood as including both temple and oracle (and excluding porch), as the next words define it], both of the temple and of the oracle [The floors, i.e., ran round the south, west, and north sides of the building. Stanley aptly compares them to the little shops which nestle under the continental cathedrals; though the side aisles of some Gothic churches, viewed externally, would perhaps better represent their proportions] and he made chambers [צְלָעעות, literally, ribs, beams, (Gesenius); Rippen (Bahr). The design of the word is clearly to convey that the floors were \"divided by partitions into distinct compartments\" (Merz). According to Ezekiel 41:6 (where, however, the reading is doubtful) there were thirty-three of these side chambers; according to Josephus (Ant. 8:08. 2) thirty. Thenius is probably not so far wrong when he sees in these chambers bedrooms. A sort of monastery would seem to have been attached to the temple. So many chambers could hardly have been required for the \"preservation of temple stores and utensils\" (Keil), or of offerings (Ewald). Whatever their use, we can hardly suppose that they were wholly without light, though nothing is said about windows. They may have had \"fixed lattices.\" It is to be re. membered that the priests and Levites ministered \"by night in the house of the Lord\" (Psalm 134:1)] round about.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The nethermost chamber [Heb. floor; cf.

See below] round about [same word as in ver. 5. The recesses in the wall ran round the north, west, and south sides of the building; they were co-extensive, i.e., with the flats or side chambers], that the beams should not be fastened [Heb. that no fastening] into the walls of the house. [The meaning is perfectly clear, viz., that the timbers should not be let into the walls, (\"they had not hold in the wall of the house,\" Ezekiel 41:6); but why this was forbidden is not quite so certain. According to Bahr, it was in order to preserve the great and costly stones of the temple intact; but others, with greater probability, hold that it was because it appeared unseemly to have the side chambers, which were for semi-secular purposes (cubicles, perhaps), made an actual part of the sacred edifice. Anyhow, it is clear that the beams rested on ledges made in the walls; but whether in the temple wall only, or in the outer wall of the side structure also, is uncertain. The preceding sketch will not only illustrate the difference, but will help the reader to understand the description preceding. In drawing (1) rebatements are showed only in the temple or inner wall, In (2) they are showed in both walls. In (1) the edifice is represented with a fiat; in (2) with a span roof. Keil decides in favour of the first arrangement (1), and Bahr says somewhat positively, \"The outer wall of the structure had no rests.\" In fact, he suggests that the whole of this side building may have been of wood. It must be admitted that we do know that there were rebatements in the wall A, whereas nothing is said as to the outer wall B. It may also be reasonably alleged that the considerations of fitness and sacredness which forbade the insertion of the beams into the sanctuary wall would not apply to the outer wall, which was a part of the side structure only. Against this view, however, may be urged the extreme thickness of wall which this method of building would necessitate. For unless we suppose that the floor of the ground story rested on the rock, and so was quite detached from the building, we must suppose four rebatements, so that if the wall at the top were two cubits wide, it would be no less than six cubits (or nine feet) at the bottom. It is true that the walls of ancient buildings were of extraordinary thickness, but it must also be remembered that the temple was not fifty feet high. However, Ezekiel 41:9 suggests that the outside wall (B) may have been five cubits in thickness, and, if so, the inner wall would hardly be less. Fergusson, therefore, has some justification for putting each wall down as five cubits wide; but on the whole, perhaps, the plan represented in (1) appears the more probable. The historian here digresses for a moment to speak of the remarkable and, indeed, unprecedented way in which the temple was built, The stories were shaped and prepared beforehand in the quarry, so that there was nothing to do on their arrival in the temple area but to fit them into their place in the building.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready [Heb. perfect. This does not mean unhewn, though אֵבָנִים שְׁלְמות is undoubtedly used in Deuteronomy 27:6 (cf. Exodus 20:25) of unhewn or virgin stone; and Gesenius would so understand the expression here, But the context seems rather to convey the idea that the stones were not shaped on the spot. It was apparently the belief of the ancients that stones of proper shape and size were provided in their bed by God (so Theodoret and Procopius,) It is inconceivable, however, that no dressing or preparation of any kind would be required; an idea, moreover, which is contradicted by 1 Kings 5:18. When Gardiner (in Bahr, American edition) quotes Keil (in his earlier work) as understanding \"all unviolated stones of the quarry,\" he hardly does justice to that author, who straightway adds, \"that is, not altogether unhewn stones... but stones that were so hewn and wrought in the quarry that neither hammer,\" etc. (see below). Similarly Thehius and Bahr] before it was brought thither [so the Authorized Version renders מַסָּע but mistakenly. It means, the quarry (Gesenius, Keil. For the construction, see Ewald, 289a, and Gesenius, Gram. ed. Rodiger, p. 170.) The verb נָסַע is used of quarrying in 1 Kings 5:31 (Heb.) [1 Kings 5:17] Where was this quarry? The general idea is that it was in the Lebanon. And it is not to be denied that some of the massive substructions and cornerstones of the temple may have been brought from the mountain, along with the wood; but the bulk of the stone, there can be no doubt, was found much nearer home. Some of it, according to the Mishna (Middoth, 3:4), came from Bethlehem; but we can hardly be mistaken in believing that for the most part it was quarried in Jerusalem itself, under the very temple rock, and out of the vast caverns recovered some years ago by Dr. Barclay (see his \"City of the Great King\"), the \"Royal Caverns\" of Josephus. See \"Quart. Journal,\" Pal. Explor. Fund (No. 7.), pp, 373, 374, and cf. p. 34. There are unmistakable evidences of these extensive caverns having served as a quarry. Not only are the walls cut straight, but rude masses are left here and there to support the roof, and, what is still more convincing, there are stones more or less cut out of the rock, and incisions are made where stones are to be quarried. There was no reason why the workmen should go far afield for stone when they had it, and of very excellent quality, at their own doors]: so that there was neither hammer [Heb. and hammers. Keil understands \"finished stones of the quarry, and hammer, and axe.\" But the word \"was built\" (נִבְנֶה), coming as it does between \"quarry\" and \"hammers,\" almost forbids this connexion] nor axe [Heb. the axe] nor any tool [Heb. every tool] of iron heard in the house, while it was building. [The historian remarks on this, not only because it was so unusual, but with the evident idea that it was a fulfilment of the spirit of the law (Deuteronomy 27:5, 6), which required the altar to be of virgin stones, untouched by tool of iron. If the quarries are to be identified with the \"Royal Caverns,\" it is easy to understand how the temple rose up in silence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - After recording this interesting and singular fact, the historian resumes his description of the side building.

This has led Thenius, Keil, Ewald, Bahr, al. to substitute הַתַּחֲתּנָח (following the LXX. and Targum), which would give the sense of \"lower story\" (as in Ezekiel 41:7). Bahr says this \"must necessarily be read.\" That this emendation has much in its favour must be allowed, but it seems also certain that we get a perfectly clear meaning from the text as it stands, viz., that \"the door (leading to) the middle floor was (on the ground floor) on the right side,\" etc. It is hardly likely that all the compartments on the ground floor had only one approach, and the doors which communicated with them may well have been passed over as requiring no special notice. But the historian feels it necessary to state how the second and third stories were reached, and the staircase which led to them causes him to speak of the position of the door which opened upon it] was in the right side [Heb. shoulder. This word (כֶּתֶפ) almost implies that the door was in the external wall of the side structure, not in the wall of the holy place (as Bottcher, al.) The fact that the floor joists were not inserted into the temple walls, as being inconsistent with the dignity of the sanctuary, makes it almost a certainty that there was no direct communication between the building and its dependance. It is very improbable that the walls of the house were anywhere broken through. The \"right side\" was the south side (1 Kings 7:39), i.e., the right, not as one faced the oracle, but, like the building, faced east.

But Mr. Fergussen has alleged some reasons for believing that it was a span or gable roof. It is true that Oriental buildings almost invariably have externally flat(internally arched) roofs. In Palestine, because of the scarcity of timber, no other form is possible. But the temple, as we have seen, was constructed after the model of the tabernacle, and the latter, as the name almost implies, and as necessity would require, had a ridged roof (see Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1453). It does not necessarily follow, however, as Fergusson assumes, that the temple followed the tabernacle in this respect. It is obvious that when a \"house was built unto the name of the Lord,\" the form of the tent might be abandoned as inappropriate. It is true that this shape would be consecrated to them by many centuries of use, but it is also possible that in a house it would strike them as altogether bizarre.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And then [Heb. omits] he built chambers [Heb. the floor (הַיָּצִועַ). The word (masculine) is here again used of the entire side structure] against all the house, five cubits high [i.e., each story was five cubits (7.5 feet). The three stories would altogether measure fifteen cubits, and of course something must be allowed for joists, floors, etc. The entire height of the side structure (exterior) would consequently be about 18 or 20 cubits. And as the house was internally 30 cubits high, the exterior measurement would probably be about 32 cubits. It has hence been inferred that between the side structure and the top of temple wall there would be a clear space of 12 or 14 cubits, in which the windows were inserted. But this is based on the assumption that the side structure had a flat roof, which is by no means certain. If the roof leaned against the walls of the house, with a low pitch, there would still be space amply sufficient for the clerestory windows. Rawlinson's diagram (p. 511), which gives 80 cubits as the height from basement to ridge of roof, and only allows 20 cubits for height of walls, practically makes the house 20 instead of 30 cubits high, for it is hardly likely that it had an open roof. In fact, we know that it had a cieling (ver. 14), which must have been at the height of 30 cubits (see the diagrams on p. 102. InNEWLINENEWLINE(1) house and side structure are represented with flat, inNEWLINENEWLINE(2) with ridged or sloping roofs),NEWLINENEWLINEunless there was an upper chamber above the house, as to which see ver. 20. Rawlinson's diagram has this further defect, that he allows nothing for thickness of joists, floors, and cielings. If we allow one cubit for each floor, then, on his plan, there would be little or no room left for the windows. This verse is hardly to be considered as a repetition of ver. 5, the side structure being here mentioned in connexion with its height and the materials used in its construction] and they rested on [the meaning of the Heb. וַיֶּאֶחֹז has been much disputed. It is uncertain what is the nominative, Solomon (as in וַיִּבֶן), or the \"floor\" (just referred to in קומָתו). Gesenius understands the former, and renders, \"he covered the house,\" etc. Thenius, \"he fastened the floor,\" etc. Keil adopts the latter alternative, \"it held to the house with cedar beams.\" It may be urged against this rendering (as also against Thenius's) that beams which merely rested on the walls would hardly bind or hold the side structure to the main building. But it is almost impossible to decide between these interpretations. We may either render \"he covered,\" etc. (with Chald., Vulg.) in which case ver. 10 would agree with ver. 9 (each, i.e., would refer to the roofing; ver. 9 to roof of temple; ver. 10 to roof of side structure and its stories); or we may take the words to mean \"it laid hold of, i.e., rested on] the house with timber of cedar. At this point the historian interrupts his description of the building to record the gracious promise made to the king during its erection. It should, perhaps, be stated that this (vers. 11-14) is omitted in the Vat. LXX. But it has every mark of genuineness.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And the word of the Lord came to Solomon [probably through the prophet Nathan.

Possibly Solomon had already betrayed some slight tokens of declension], and execute my Judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform [literally, confirm.

Deuteronomy 31:6. A fresh element is here introduced into the promise, arising out of the erection of the temple. God had pledged His presence to the tabernacle (Exodus 25:8; Exodus 29:45; cf. Leviticus 26:11). And the temple was reared to be His dwelling place (1 Kings 8:13; 2 Chronicles 6:2). He now assures the royal builder that he will occupy it. \"Jehovah Shammah\" (Ezekiel 48:35).

Ver. 9 speaks of the finishing of the shell.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And he built [i.e., constructed, covered] the walls of the house within [but not without also, as Stanley affirms, \"Its massive stonewalls were entirely cased in cedar, so as to give it the appearance of a rough log house\"] with boards [or beams (צְלָעות): same word as in vers. 5-8] of cedar [Heb. cedars. The practice of covering stone walls with a lining of wood, which in turn was ornamented with gold or colour (Jeremiah 22:14), seems to have had its origin in Phoenicia (Bahr), and may have been suggested to Solomon by his Zidonian workmen (Cf. 2 Chronicles 2:14), both the floor of the house and the walls of the cieling [This gives no sense and is against the Hebrew, which is as the marg. - \"from the floor... unto the walls,\" etc. The expression walls of the cieling,\" though it may be taken to mean \"the walls where they join the cieling,\" is peculiar, and the suggestion that for קִירות walls, we should read קורות beams - the word of the parallel verse in 2 Chronicles - has everything in its favour. The LXX. reads εὥς τῶν δοκῶν]: and [omit] he covered them on the inside with wood [This is apparently a mere repetition. The A.V. would lead us to suppose that a fresh particular was stated. We learn from 2 Chronicles 3:6 that not only were the walls, or their wooden lining, covered with plates of gold, \"gold of Parvaim,\" but they were likewise ornamented with precious stones], and he covered the floor of the house with planks of fir [see on 1 Kings 5:8].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And he built twenty cubits on [Heb. from] the sides of the house both the floor and the walls [Heb. as in ver. 15, \"from the floor to the walls\" (or beams). If קִירות is a copyist's error, it is repeated here] with boards of cedar [He is now speaking of the wooden partition which separated the oracle from the temple of the house. At a distance of 20 cubits, measured along the sides from the west end of the house, he erected a cedar wall which reached from the floor to the cieling] he even built them [i.e., the 20 cubits] for it [the house] within [The meaning is clear, though the construction is somewhat involved, viz., that he reared this partition inside the house to separate a portion for the oracle] even for the oracle [Heb. an oracle] even for the most holy place [Heb. for the holy of holies].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And the house, that is, the temple before it [or, the anterior temple.

Thenius, however, supposes that דְּבִיר (oracle) has fallen out of the text. Our author now describes the division of the building into holy and most holy place] was forty cubits long.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And the cedar of the house within [lit. cedar (wood) was placed against the house inside] was carved with knops [Heb. sculpture of gourds. The sculpture is in apposition to cedar. The authorities are divided as to the kind of sculpture intended. Keil thinks they were bassi relievi; Bahr contends that, like those of the Egyptian monuments, they were sunken, פְּקָעִים is generally assumed to be synonymous with פְּקֻעֹת \"squirting cucumbers\" (2 Kings 4:39, note). Bahr, however, justly observes that a deadly fruit, such as this is described to have been, was hardly likely to be employed in the decoration of the sanctuary, and he would render the word \"buds.\" Keil thinks the gourds were oval ornaments, something like the wild gourd, which ran in rows along the walls. See the illustration, \"Slab from Kouyunjik,\" Dict. Bib. 2 p. 49] and open flowers [lit. burstings of flowers. These words again are very variously interpreted. Thenius: festoons of flowers; Keil: open flower buds; Gesen.: expanded flowers]: all was cedar; there was no stone seen. [Really, the cedar was no more seen than the stone, for this in turn was overlaid with gold (ver. 22.)]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And the oracle [Heb. an oracle. Heb. דְּבִיר probably from דָּבַר speak. Sc Jerome,oraculum; and Aquila and Symm. χρηματιστήριον. Gesenius, Bahr, al., however, interpret the word to mean the hinder part, adytum] he prepared in the house within [lit. in the midst of the house within, i.e., between the Holy Place and the end structure] to set there [the principal purpose which the oracle served. תִתֵּן = תֵּת with repeated syllable. Cf. 1 Kings 17:14, Ken] the ark of the covenant of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And the oracle in the forepart [or, the interior of the oracle. Keil, after Kimchi, maintains that לִפְנֵי is the construct of the noun לִפְנִים. See ver. 29, where it clearly means interior, as its opposition to \"without\" shows. The A.V. yields no sense] was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof [that is to say, it was a perfect cube. When we consider that the oracle of the tabernacle was a cube of ten cubits and the Holy City (Revelation 21:16; cf. Ezekiel 48:8-35, especially ver. 20) is a cube of 12,000 furlongs, we cannot but regard these measurements as significant. To the ancients the square seemed the most appropriate shape to express the idea of moral perfection. The idea of the cube consequently was that of entire completeness, of absolute perfection. A little light is thrown on this subject by the use of τετράγωνος among the Greeks. See the quotation from Simonides in Plat. Protag. 334 A; Arist. Rhet. 3:11; Eth. Nic. 1:10, 11, and compare the familiar \"totus teres atque rotundus.\" The height of the oracle (internally) being only twenty cubits, while that of the house was thirty (ver. 2), several questions of some interest suggest themselves for consideration. It is perhaps impossible in the present state of our knowledge to arrive at any very positive conclusions, but it may be well, nevertheless, if only to show in how much uncertainty the architecture of the temple is involved, to state them. First among them is this: Was the roof of the temple flat or ridged? (See above on ver. 9).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) In either case, was the height of thirty cubits, or any uniform height, maintained throughout, or was the roof of the oracle some ten cubits lower than that of the house? The analogy of the tabernacle, of which the temple was a copy, would lead us to suppose that the ridge - if there was a ridge - of the entire building was level and unbroken, though the analogy of the Gothic church, which, we have already seen, is almost a reproduction of the temple, suggests that the oracle (like the chancel, and, it may be added, like the adytum of Egyptian temples) may possibly have had a lower roof. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(3) supposing the same height was maintained from end to end, to what use, if any, was the vacant space of ten cubits (15 feet) between cieling and roof of oracle applied? It has been held by some that there was a chamber here, but that it was empty, being formed, in fact, not for use, but in order to procure the cubical shape of the oracle. Others contend that this upper room, or one which ran the entire length of the building, was designed to serve as a receptacle for the reliques of the tabernacle, and they would identify it with the עֲלִיות. (LXX, τὸ ὑπερῷον) of 2 Chronicles 3:9. And untrustworthy as Josephus is when not supported by independent evidence, it is worth mentioning here that beth he and the Talmud \"persistently assert that there was a superstructure on the temple equal in height to the lower part\" (Fergusson, who, consequently, is of opinion that there undoubtedly was some such superstructure, as in the tomb of Darius, near Persepolis (see Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1456, 1-457), and that it was used for worship (2 Kings 23:12), where see note). Bahr, however, argues forcibly against this idea. He says, inter alia, that there was no approach provided to these chambers; but our account is so manifestly imperfect that this argument is at the best a precarious one. He sees in the \"upper chambers\" (the Hebrew word is plural) the upper stories of the side structure. He agrees, however, with Ewald that there was a chamber over the oracle, but thinks it was unoccupied. Keil identifies this space with the \"upper chambers\" of 2 Chronicles 3:9, and upon the whole this appears to be the most feasible view.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) How was the cieling, whether with or without this upper chamber, and whether at the height of twenty or thirty cubits - how was it supported? For \"no cedar beam could be laid across a space of twenty cubits without sinking in the centre by its own weight.\" Fergusson hence argues that the roof must have been carried on pillars - four in the sanctuary and ten in the hall. He remarks that they were used in the house of the Forest of Lebanon, where they were less suitable than here]: and he overlaid it [lit. made it shine] with pure gold [marg. shut up (from סָגַר clausit). Cf. Job 28:15 (Heb.) The same gold is described as טָהור (Exodus 25:11) and טוב (2 Chronicles 3:8). It is called \"shut up gold,\" not because it was concealed (κειμέλιον), but because of the exclusion of impure ingredients (Vulg. aurum purissimum). The lavish use of gold in the interior of the temple - its weight 600 talents (75,000 lbs.), its value almost incalculable - was not for mere display (for most of it was never seen except by the priests), but was symbolical of light and purity (Job 37:22, 23; Revelation 21:18), and stamped the place as the abode of Him who dwelleth in light (1 Timothy 6:16). See Bahr in loc. The palace of the Lord must be \"exceeding magnifical.\" The overlaying was not gilding, but laminae of gold were attached to the woodwork with nails. This art was probably derived from Egypt (Exodus 25:11, 13). Egyptian figures ornamented with gold plates are found both in the Louvre and British Museum. See Wilkinson, \"Ancient Egyptians,\" 2. p. 233 sqq.) Rawlinson remarks that \"such ornamentation was common in Babylon, in Assyria, and in Media.\" See Isaiah 46:6; Herod. 1:98; Layard, 2:264. In addition to the gold, the house was garnished with precious stones (2 Chronicles 3:6). Cf. 1 Chronicles 29:2, 8]; and so covered the [Heb. an] altar which was of cedar. [The italics in the A.V. lead us to suspect a mistranslation, and such it proves to be. What the writer means, supposing the present text to be retained, is, not that Solomon covered the cedar altar with gold, but that he overlaid the (stone?) altar with cedar. It is true the article is wanting, but this may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that the altar is now mentioned for the first time (Keil). It is much more probable, however, that the text has been slightly corrupted. The LXX. reads, καὶ ἐποίησε θυσιαστήριον (Cod. Alex. adds κέδρου), which proves that the Seventy had וַיַּעַשׂ instead of וַיְּצַפ in their text. If so, the absence of the article is at once explained, and an unmeaning repetition in ver. 22 avoided. The mention of the altar - of course it is the altar of incense that is meant: the altar of burnt sacrifice was outside the building - in connexion with the oracle is significant. In ver. 22 it is called the \"altar that (belonged) to the oracle,\" because it stood just outside it. In the tabernacle it was placed \"before the vail\" (Exodus 30:6; Exodus 40:5, 26; Leviticus 16:12-18), and it occupied this position because the incense burned upon it was offered before the Invisible Presence within. It is an argument in favour of the textual emendation suggested above that the altar in the tabernacle was of wood (Exodus 30:1), and that Ezekiel speaks of the \"altar of wood\" (Ezekiel 41:22), the altar of sacrifice being of earth stones (Exodus 20:24, 25), or brass (2 Chronicles 4:1) If we retain the Received Text we are almost compelled to believe that this altar was also of stone, as they would hardly cover a wooden altar with wood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - So [Heb. And. The ornamentation of the holy place is next mentioned] Solomon overlaid the house [as well as the oracle] within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle [These words are extremely obscure. The prevailing view is that of Gesenius, al., that יַעֲבֵּר = \"he bolted,\" etc. But, if so, what did the chains bolt? Bahr says, the boards of the cedar partition, just as the bars fastened together the boards of the tabornacle (Exodus 26:26-29). Gesen. himself (together with Keil, marg., al.) understands the doors, \"he bolted the doors of the oracle,\" so as to keep them closed, except on the day of atonement. But the literal rendering is, \"he carried over with chains of gold before the oracle,\" where nothing is said of either boards or doors. The more natural interpretation, therefore, would perhaps be: he carried on the gold plates of the house in chains of gold across the partition, and so fastened it to the side walls. Perhaps this was done to avoid any fracture of, or insertion into, the stonework]; and he overlaid it [What? Keil says, the cedar altar last mentioned at the end of ver. 20. But the altar has now dropped out of the reader's, and therefore presumably out of the writer's mind. It would be more natural to understand the words of the oracle just mentioned, but the adornment of the oracle has already been related (ver. 20), and it is hardly likely that having stated that it was covered with pure gold in one verse, he would mention that it was overlaid with gold in the next. It looks as if the cedar partition were referred to, the boards \"before the oracle\"] with gold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And the whole house he overlaid with gold [This no mere repetition, more Hebraico, as Bahr and Keil would have us think. Something additional must surely be referred to, and 2 Chronicles 3:4 warrants us in understanding this statement to include the porch, the interior of which was gilded. Because the porch is elsewhere (ver. 3) distinguished from the \"house,\" it does not follow that it can never be comprehended under that term] until he had finished all the house: also [Heb. and]. the altar that was by [Heb. to. See on ver. 20] the oracle he overlaid with gold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And within the oracle [The description now passes on to the mysterious symbolic figures which were placed in the holy of holies] he made two cherubims [As to the nature, composition, and significance of the cherubim, see notes on Exodus 25:19; 37:7. The only particulars which will require notice here are those in which the cherub of the temple differed from that of the tabernacle] of olive tree [Heb. trees or wood of oil. The oleaster (wild olive) is supposed to be intended, the proper name for the olive tree being זַיִת (Nehemiah 8:15). The wood of the oleaster, which is firm, fine grained, and durable, was used by the Greeks for the images of their gods (Winer). The cherubim of the tabernacle were of solid gold; those of the temple, on account of their great size (fifteen feet high) were necessarily of less costly material. But though of wood, yet the most durable and beautiful of wood, the olive, was employed in their construction. It is noticeable how olive wood is employed for the cherubim and doors of oracle, and for the posts of the temple doorway; the less precious cedar was used for lining the walls and for Beams, etc., while for the floor and doors of house, the commoner cypress sufficed], each ten cubits high.

[The constant recurrence of the number ton, the symbol of completeness and perfection, is not to be overlooked.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims [The marg. reading, the cherubim stretched forth their wings, is altogether inadmissible], so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wan, and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. [In 2 Chronicles 3:10 we are told that the cherubim were of \"image work\" (the meaning of the Hebrews word is unknown). We also learn that they \"stood on their feet\" and, unlike the cherubim of the tabernacle, which faced each other (Exodus 27:9), faced the throne, i.e., the cedar partition, and the east. The object of this arrangement probably was to enable the wings to be stretched out across the sanctuary. In the tabernacle the wings were \"spread out on high\" (Exodus 25:20; Exodus 27:9). In both cases the ark and mercy seat were placed under the overshadowing wings (ch. 8:6). There would be a clear space of eight or nine cubits between the bodies of the cherubim, and the ark only measured 2.5 cubits (Exodus 25:10) in length and 1.5 cubits in breadth. Unlike Ezekiel's cherubim (Ezekiel chs. 1, 10; cf. Revelation 4:7), these had apparently but one face. The cherub was not a simple, but a complex being, having no unalterable and fixed form. See Bahr, Symbolik, 1. pp. 313, 314; Dict. Bib. vol. 1. pp. 301-303.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he overlaid the cherubims with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims [lit. openings, i.e., gravings or indentations of cherubim, פִּתּוּחִים is used of gravings in stone, Exodus 28:11; Exodus 39:6: in metal, 28:36; 39:30] and palm trees and open flowers [The open flowers may well have been lilies (1 Kings 7:19, 22, 26). It is uncertain whether there were one or more rows of cherubim and palms. Keil, arguing from the analogy of Egyptian temples, contends for two or three rows, but it is doubtful how far the Israelites, notwithstanding their new and intimate relations with the country, would take Egypt and its idolatrous shrines for a model. Ezekiel 41:18 tends to show that the palm trees alternated with the cherubs. The cherubim may have had two faces, such as he describes (ver. 19), the face of a man on the one side, and the face of a young lion on the other side; but if so, they must have differed in form from those of the oracle. Possibly the open flowers formed a border, or were sculptured in festoons, above, and the gourds (or buds) formed a border below (as in the Kouyunjik slab). But as to this the text is silent. But while we are ignorant of the precise form and of the arrangement of these ornamental carvings, we are not wholly in the dark as to their symbolism. For everything in the temple, we may be sure, had a meaning. Let us inquire, then, into the significance of the cherubim, the palms and the flowers.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The Cherubim have been regarded by some as symbols of the invisible Godhead, by others as \"representations of the heavenly spirits which surround the Lord of glory and set forth psychical life at its highest stage\" (Keil); but it seems best to view them as symbols of all animal life, including the highest and perhaps not excluding the thought of Him who is the source and spring of life, the Anima animantium (cf. ch. 12:28). Hence they are spoken of as הַחַיּות (Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 15, etc.) \"the living things\" (compare τὰ ζῶα, Revelation 4:6, 8, 9), and even as הַחַיָּה \"the life\" (Ezekiel 10:14, 15, etc.) The cherubim consequently speak of the great animal kingdom before its Creator. \"Creaturely being reaches its highest degree in those which have an anima, and among these, the lion, the bull, the eagle, and the man are the highest and most complete\" (Bahr). These shapes, accordingly, were not inappropriate or unmeaning in a temple raised by the creature to the glory of the Creator.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Just as the cherubim speak of animal, so do the Palms of vegetable life. They are \"the princes of the vegetable kingdom\" (Linnaeus) \"Amongst trees there is none so lofty and towering, none which has such a fair majestic growth, which is so evergreen, and which affords so grateful a shade and such noble fruits - fruits which are said to be the food of the blessed in paradise - as the palm\" (Bahr), who also adds that it is said to have as many excellent properties as there are days in the year, and cites Humboldt as designating it the \"noblest of plants forms to which the nations have always accorded the meed of beauty.\" Judaea, he further remarks, is the fatherland of the palm, so much so that the palm in later days became the symbol of Palestine (as on the well known coin with the legend Judaea capta). The palms, therefore, tell of the vegetable world, and of Him who fashioned its noble and graceful forms.NEWLINENEWLINE3. And very similar was the testimony of the Flowers. \"Flowers and bloom have been, from ancient times to our own, the usual symbols of lifefulness .... So then by the flower work, as well as by the cherubim and the palm trees, was the dwelling of Jehovah, which was adorned therewith, designated as an abode of life\" (Bahr). On the earthly dwelling place of the Eternal, that is to say, were everywhere pourtrayed the various tokens of His Almighty power and goodness. And the significance of each is the same. \"Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created.\" They were graved] within and without. [These words, here and in ver. 30, are generally taken to mean \"in the oracle and in the house.\" But it is worthy of consideration whether they do not rather signify, \"in the house and in the porch.\" The latter was overlaid with gold (2 Chronicles 3:4). It is doubtful whether לַחִיצון on the outside, can be applied to any part of the interior, and here its application would be to the oracle (Thenius)].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And for the entering of the oracle, he made doors [which hung on golden hinges (1 Kings 7:50] of olive tree [see on ver. 23)], the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall. [The meaning of the Hebrew words has been much disputed. See Gesen. Thesaur, 1. pp. 43-45. Gesen. himself interprets as A.V.: crepido cum postibus erat quinta pars, i.e., quintam parietis partem occupabat. The Rabbins: the \"entablature with side posts and threshold formed a pentagon.\" But a pentagonal doorway is without example in Eastern architecture. Thenius: \"the strength (אַיִל is generally taken as an architectural term = crepido portae, or entablature) of the posts was a fifth.\" Rawlinson: \"the lintel was one-fifth of wall, and each door post one-fifth of its height;\" in which case the doorway would of course be a square of four cubits. But perhaps the rendering of A.V. (with which Keil and Bahr also agree) is more natural. The meaning, consequently, would be that the entrance to the oracle, inclusive of the side posts which helped to form it, occupied one-fifth of the extent of the cedar partition. The entrance to the house (ver. 33) was one-fourth of the wall of the house.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The two doors also wore [Rather, perhaps, \"And he made\" is to be supplied from ver. 31, as Keil. Rawlinson remarks that such doors as these are characteristic of Assyrian gateways] of olive tree: and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread [וַיָּרֶד Hiph. of רָדַד] gold [Heb. the gold] upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees [The writer means, not that the carving alone was gilded - as Thenius thinks, who remarks on the effective contrast which the dark red cedar and the bright gold would furnish) - but that the gilding did not conceal the character of the carvings. It is clear from ver. 22 that \"all the house\" blazed with gold in every part. If the floors were covered with gold, we may be sure both walls and doors would not be without their coating of the precious metal. Our author does not mention the curtain - it is clear that the doors would not dispense with the necessity for a vail - but the chronicler does (2 Chronicles 3:14). It was necessary in order to cover the ark (Exodus 40:3, 21); hence it was sometimes called \"the vail of the covering.\" But for this, when the doors were opened on the day of atonement, the priest in the holy place might have gazed into the oracle. See on 1 Kings 8:8. The doors opened outwardly (into the house). The vail was suspended within the oracle.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - So also [i.e., similarly] made he for the door [or entrance, doorway] of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth [Heb. from a fourth] part of the wall. It is uncertain whether we are to understand the \"fourth part\" of the height or of the breadth of the doorway, though the latter is probably meant. The height of the wall is variously estimated; generally at 30 (ver. 2), but by Rawlinson at 20 cubits. But the breadth is beyond dispute. It was 20 cubits. The doorway, consequently, would be five cubits wide. The effect of the preposition, \"from a fourth,\" is probably this: The entrance with the side posts subtracted one-fourth from the space of the wall.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - And the two doors were [As in ver. 32, the verb is to be supplied from the verse preceding. And he made two doors, etc.] of fir tree [בְּרוש see note on 1 Kings 5:8]: the two leaves [lit. ribs, same word as in vers. 5, 8, 10] of the one door were folding [Heb. rolling], and the two leaves [קְלָעִים is probably - a clerical error for צְלָעִים arising out of the קָלַע, in vers. 32, 35] of the other [Heb. second] door were folding. [It seems more natural to suppose that the leaves were formed by a vertical than by a horizontal division. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the word גָּלִיל would be applied the latter arrangement. Keil objects to the former on the ground that the leaves would thus be only one cubit broad each, and the opening of one leaf, consequently, would be insufficient to admit of any person's passing through. But to this it may be repliedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the opening of two leaves would in any case form a sufficiently wide entrance, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that it is not said that all the leaves were of uniform width. Besides, the other arrangement is without precedent in the public buildings of the East.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers [The constant recurrence of the same forms is in itself a proof that they must have been significant], and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work [Heb. made straight upon the engraved work. That is to say, the gold fitted closely to all the uneven and indented surface of the figures. Elsewhere, laminae were simply laid upon the level walls, etc.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The description of the buildings concludes with a brief reference to the enceinte or court. And he built the inner court [The mention of an inner court, called in 2 Chronicles 4:9 the \"court of the priests,\" presupposes, of course, the existence of an outer court. Our author does not mention this, but the chronicler does, under the name of \"the great court.\" In Jeremiah 36:10, the former is called the \"higher court,\" because it occupied a higher level] with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams. [These, it is thought, formed the enclosing wall of the court (the LXX. adds κυκλόθεν). The cedar beams were instead of coping stones. It has been supposed, however (J.D. Michaelis), that these three rows of stone, boarded with cedar, formed the pavement of the court. But the question at once suggests itself, Why pile three rows of stones one upon another merely to form a pavement, and why hew and shape them if they were to be concealed beneath a stratum of wood? It is a fair inference from 2 Chronicles 7:3, that the wall was low enough to permit men to look over it. Fergusson, on the contrary, argues that it must have been twice the height of the enclosure of the tabernacle, which would give us an elevation of ten cubits (Exodus 27:18). It is worth suggesting, however, whether, the inner court being raised above the outer, which surrounded it, these stones may not have formed the retaining wall or sides of the platform. As the outer court had gates (2 Kings 11:6; 2 Kings 12:9; 2 Chronicles 4:9; 2 Chronicles 23:5; 2 Chronicles 24:8), it also must have had walls. From 2 Kings 23:11; Jeremiah 35:2; Jeremiah 36:10, we gather that there were various chambers in the forecourt. Such were certainly contemplated by David (1 Chronicles 28:12); but it is not recorded that Solomon built them. Nor have we any warrant, except the bare assertion of Josephus, for the belief that he built a colonnade or cloister on the east side, such as was known to later ages by the name of \"Solomon's Porch\" (John 10:23; Acts 3:11; Acts 5:12). As to the dimensions of these spaces, we are left to conjecture. If, as in everything else, the dimensions of the tabernacle were doubled, then the court of the priests would measure 200 cubits from east to west, and 100 cubits from north to south. It should be stated, however, that in the temple of Ezekiel, the proportions of which, in the present instance, may well he historical, both courts are represented as perfect squares. Rawlinson inadvertently puts down the length (along the side of temple) at 100 cubits, and the breadth (ends of temple) at 200. The outer court would probably be twice as large as the inner, i.e., 400 x 200 cubits. But all this is necessarily uncertain.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid, in the month Zif [see on ver. 1].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings6:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it.

Keil understands it to signify produce (prowntus), and sees in it the month of fruits. It extended from the November to the December full moon], which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof [Heb. דִּבָרָיו], and according to all the fashion of it [Heb. מִשְׁפָטָיו]. So was he seven years in building it. [As Bul was the eighth month, and Zif the second, the house was precisely seven and a half years in building - a short period, if we consider the magnitude of the undertaking, but long enough, if we remember the enormous number of hands employed upon it, the preparations made by David, and the modest dimensions of the edifice (ver. 2). The commentators all cite Pliny's statement that all Asia was building the temple of Diana at Ephesus 200 years, but the cases are not at all parallel. We learn from 2 Chronicles 3:2, that it was on the second day of the month that the building was commenced. Bishop Wordsworth, who assigns seven years and seven months as the time occupied in this work, sees in this hebdomatie period an analogy to the seven days of the creation.]NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years [There is no contrast implied between the time spent upon the temple and that occupied in the building of the palace, as the word \"but\" seems to suggest. The close connexion which exists in the original is interrupted by the division of chapters. In 1 Kings 6:38 we read, \"So was he seven years in building it.\" 1 Kings 7:1 then proceeds, \"And he was building his own house thirteen years.\" The much longer period occupied in the erection of the royal palace is easily accounted for. In the first place, the buildings were much larger, and the undertaking altogether was a much more extensive one (ver. 2). Then, though seven years only were consumed in the actual building of the temple, yet preparations for the work had been made, both by David and Solomon, for a long time beforehand. Lastly, a special force of labourers would appear to have been employed on the temple, while it is probable that they wrought at the palaces in greatly diminished numbers. So that the longer period spent over his own house does not argue selfishness or worldliness on Solomon's part. On the contrary, it speaks well for his piety that he built the temple first and urged on that sacred work with so much vigour. The thirteen years date from the completion of the seven years of 1 Kings 6:38. That is to say, the building of the temple and palace together occupied twenty years, as is expressly stated in 1 Kings 9:10. It is therefore one of Stanley's reckless statements that the palace \"was commenced at the same time as the temple, but not finished till eight years afterwards\"], and he finished all his house. [By Solomon's \"house\" we are not to understand his private palace, or residence proper, alone (see ver. 8), but a range of palaces, more or less connected including the \"house of the forest of Lebanon\" (ver. 2), \"the porch of pillars\" (ver. 6), the throne-room or judgment hall (ver. 7), his own house and the house of Pharaoh's daughter (ver. 8). That all these are comprehended under the term \"house\" is evident from 1 Kings 9:1, 10, 15; 1 Kings 10:12, where Solomon's buildings are always spoken of as two, viz., \"the house of the Lord\" and the \"king's house.\" The situation of this string of palaces is by no means certain. Josephus says it stood over against (or opposite) the temple, which is highly probable; but this still leaves the question of site open, for the palace would be justly described as ἄντικρυς ἔχων ναὸν, whether it stood west or south of the sanctuary. Ewald places it on the opposite ridge of Ophel, i.e., on the south prolongation of the temple mount; while Fergusson, Bahr, etc., locate it on the northeast side of Zion, on the opposite side of the Tyropoean valley, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. Recent explorations seem to favour Ewald's view. See \"Recovery of Jerusalem,\" pp. 319 sqq, and \"Our Work in Palestine,\" p. 159 sqq. When we remember that the very site of Zion is disputed, it will not surprise the reader that questions of this kind should be involved in uncertainty. And when it is further considered that the accumulated debris of Jerusalem at one point reaches a depth of 120 feet, it will be readily understood what obstacles stand in the way of their settlement.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He built also [Heb. and he built. The A.V. rendering almost contradicts the view just advanced, viz., that the house of the forest of Lebanon was part of \"all the house\" (ver. 1)] the house of the forest of Lebanon [so called, not because it was a summer residence in Lebanon, as some have supposed, nor yet merely because it was built of Lebanon cedar, but because it displayed, a perfect thicket or forest (יַעַר) of cedar pillars]; the length thereof was one hundred cubits [the temple proper was 60], and the breadth thereof fifty cubits [The temple was but 20. It does not follow that this space of 100 x 50 cubits was all roofed in, for it would seem as if the house was built round a courtyard. Rawlinson remarks that a roof of 75 feet is \"much greater than is ever found in Assyria.\" But it is by no means certain that there was any such roof here], and the height thereof thirty cubits [the same as the temple], upon four rows of cedar pillars [How these were disposed of, or what was their number, it is impossible to say. Thenius says they were 400, but this is pure conjecture. The description is so meagre and partial that it is impossible to form a correct idea of the building. The remark made above (ch. 6. Introd. Note) as to the temple applies with still greater force to the palaces. \"There are few tasks more difficult or puzzling than the attempt to restore an ancient building of which we possess nothing but two verbal descriptions; and these difficulties are very much enhanced when one account is written in a language like Hebrew, the scientific terms in which are, from our ignorance, capable of the widest latitude of interpretation, and the other, though written in a language of which we have a more definite knowledge, was composed by a person who could never have seen the building he was describing\" (Fergusson, Dict. Bib. 2. p. 658)], with cedar beams [כְּרֻתות cut or hewn beams] upon the pillars. [This palace, according to Fergusson, was \"the great hall of state and audience\" and the principal building of the range. But if it was this, which is very doubtful, for the throne was in the hall of judgment (1 Kings 5:7), it would seem to have served other purposes besides that of an audience-chamber. Among other things, it was certainly an armoury (1 Kings 10:17. cf. Isaiah 22:8). The Arab. Vers. calls it \"the house of his arms.\" Possibly it was also the residence of the bodyguard (cf. 1 Kings 14:28 with 1 Kings 10:17). Bahr observes that the arrangement of the palaces accords with the Jewish conceptions of the kingly office. The first, the armoury, represents him in his militant character (1 Samuel 8:20), the second in his judicial function (1 Samuel 8:5, 6; 2 Samuel 15:4; 1 Kings 3:9), while the third shows him in his private capacity.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And it was covered [or roofed] with cedar above [cf. 6:9, 15] upon the beams [צְלָעות lit., ribs, the word used in 1 Kings 6:5 of the side chambers, and in 1 Kings 6:34 (in the masculine) of the leaves of the doors], that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row. [Rawlinson, al. are much exercised to reconcile this statement with that of ver. 2, which speaks of four rows, But the explanation is very simple, viz., that the \"forty-five, fifteen in a row\" does not refer to the pillars but to the side chambers or compartments (A.V., \"beams\"). The description is so very loose and general that positive statements are out of place, but the meaning certainly appears to be this, that there was a roofing of cedar over the side chambers (which rested upon the pillars mentioned in ver. 2) forty-five in number, fifteen in a row. It is true the Masoretic punctuation is against this view. It is also clear that the LXX. understood the numbers forty-five and fifteen to refer to the pillars, for they have essayed to cut the knot by reading three rows instead of \"four rows,\" in ver. 2. Similarly the Arab. in ver. 3 reads sixty instead of forty-five; obviously another desperate attempt to solve the difficulty by a corruption of the text. But the solution suggested above is so simple and natural that we can hardly be wrong in adopting it. Bahr says positively that forty-five pillars could not have supported a structure 100 cubits by 50 cubits, \"nor could the building have been named ' forest of Lebanon' from forty-five scattered pillars.\" It would follow hence, that there were side chambers only on three sides of the building, as was the case in the temple. And if (as has been inferred from vers. 4, 5) a three-storied structure is here described; if, that is to say, the forty-five chambers were divided fifteen to a tier or story, it is highly probable that they would be distributed six to each long side and three to the rear (Bahr). This arrangement - a court surrounded by a colonnade and galleries - is still found in the East; as all travellers know. And in its favour it may be said that it is such as to have been suggested by the plan of the temple. The ground plan is the same, with this difference, that a courtyard occupies the place of the temple proper.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And there were windows [שְׁקֻפִים same word as in 1 Kings 6:4, i.e., beams or lattices. Keil understands, beam layers; and Bahr, ubergelegte Balken. The LXX. has πλευρῶν] in three rows [or tiers. All we can say is that there is a possible reference to three stories formed by the three rows of beams], and light [lit., outlook. מֶחְזָה probably means a wide outlook. LXX. χῶρα, aspectus, prospectus] was against light in three ranks [Heb. three times. The meaning is that the side chambers were so built and arranged that the rooms had their windows exactly vis-a-vis in each of the three stories. Josephus explains, θυρώμασι τριγλύφοις, windows in three divisions, but this is no explanation of the words \"light against light,\" etc. Fergusson understands the three outlooks to mean, first, the clerestory windows (that there was a clerestory he infers from Josephus Ant., 7:05.2), who describes this palace as \"in the Corinthian manner,\" which cannot mean, he says, \"the Corinthian order, which was not then invented, but after the fashion of a Corinthian oecus, which was a hall with a clerestory\");NEWLINENEWLINE(2) a range of openings under the cornice of the walls; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) a range of open doorways. But all this is conjecture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And all the doors and posts [For מְזוּזֹת posts, Thenius would read מֶהְזות outlooks, after ver. 4, which seems a natural emendation, especially as the LXX. has χῶραι. We should then get the sense of \"doors and windows \"] were square of beam. [The word translated \"windows\" in ver. 4; the proper rendering is beam, and the meaning apparently is that all these openings were square in shape. Nothing is said about the height of the rooms, and as the commentators are not agreed whether there was one story or three, that can obviously be only matter of conjecture. Rawlinson, who thinks of but one hall, with three rows of windows, supposes, after Houbigant, that one row was placed in a wall which ran down the middle of the apartment. Such an arrangement, he observes, was found by Layard at Nimrud.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And he made a porch of pillars [Heb. the porch of pillars. This was no doubt a covered colonnade, i.e., it had a roof but no sides. The pillars were its only walls. But here the question presents itself, Was this porch the vestibule of the house of the forest of Lebanon, just described? From the correspondence between its width and that of this palace, Rawlinson infers that it was (cf. 1 Kings 6:2, 3). Bahr believes it to have been the porch or entrance to the hall of judgment mentioned in the next verse, while Fergusson again assigns it an independent position, separate from either. The term porch (אוּלָם), the meaning of which is surely determined by its use in ch. 6, almost implies that it must have served as the entrance or vestibule to some building. But the size, and the fact that it had itself a porch (see below), favour the idea that it was an independent structure, though Rawlinson shows that \"most of the Persepolitan porches had small pillared chambers at some little distance in front of them,\" and refers to the Egyptian propylaea. Keil argues that this pillar hall, as he calls it, stood between the house of the forest of Lebanon and the judgment hall. Bahr, as remarked above, sees in it the anterior part of the judgment hall, which latter, he adds, bore to it the same relation that the oracle did to the temple house. He observes that as the ark was in the oracle, so the throne (1 Kings 10:18) found a place in the hall of judgment. This structure, therefore, with its porch, mentioned presently, would reproduce the main features of the temple arrangement. We see, consequently, that both the house of the forest of Lebanon and the porch of pillars followed in their outline the ground plan of the temple. Nor is this at all surprising, considering that all these edifices probably had the same architect or designer]; the length thereof was fifty cubits [the length, i.e., according to the view last advanced of the two divisions of the building, viz., the porch of pillars and the porch of judgment. But the correspondence of the length (or width - the same word is used of the width of the temple porch 1 Kings 6:3) of this porch with the width of the house of the forest of Lebanon is, to say the least, remarkable, and suggests that after all it may have been the porch of that building. If so, the resemblance to the temple would be still more striking], and the breadth [depth?] thereof thirty cubits: and the porch [Heb. a porch] was before them [i.e., the pillars. The words can only mean that a smaller porch stood before the porch of pillars, or colonnade]: and the other [omit] pillars [i.e., the pillars of the minor vestibule or fore porch] and the thick beam [Heb. threshold] were before them. [The broad threshold, approached by steps, and the pillars which it supported, together with the roof which covered them, formed the front part and approach to the larger porch or colonnade.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Then he made a porch [or the porch] for the throne where he might Judge [i.e., it was at once audience chamber (throne room, ch. 10:18) and court of justice], even the porch of judgment [Stanley remarks that this \"porch, or gate of justice, still kept alive the likeness of the old patriarchal custom of sitting in judgment at the gate.\" He then refers to the \"gate of justice\" at Granada and the \"Sublime Porte \"at Constantinople. It is, perhaps, not quite so certain that \"this porch was the gem and centre of the whole empire,\" or that because it was so much thought of a similar but smaller porch was erected for the queen (ver. 8) (\"Jewish Ch.,\" 2. p. 195)]: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. [Heb. from the floor to the floor, as marg. Gesenius understands these words to mean, \"from one floor to the other,\" i.e., to the cieling (the floor of the other story); in other words, the walls from bottom to top. So the Vulg., a pavimento usque ad summitatem, and Syr., a fundamento ad coelum ejus usque, which have led Thenius to suggest the reading עַד קּורות (unto the beams) instead of עַדהַקַּרְקַע. Keil thinks the ceiling served as the floor of an upper story, built over the porch of judgment, but, as Bahr observes, no such upper story is even hinted at elsewhere. It seems to me that, on the whole, the A.V. rendering is to be retained, the meaning being that the whole space, both of wall and cieling, from one side of the floor to the opposite side, was covered with cedar.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.

It was evidently distinct from and behind the residence of the king, an arrangement which still prevails in Eastern palaces.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All these [i.e.buildings palaces] were of costly [or precious; cf. 1 Kings 5:31 [1 Kings 5:17] and vers. 10, 11] stones, according to the measures of hewed stones [lit., of squaring or hewing, same word in 1 Kings 5:31 (Hebr.) [1 Kings 5:17], 1 Kings 6:36, and Isaiah 9:9, etc. All the stones in these several buildings were shaped to certain specified dimensions], sawed with saws [גָּרַר is obviously an onomatopoetic word, like our saw. Gesenius cites σαίρω, serro, etc. The Egyptians, whose saws were apparently all single handed, do not seem to have applied this instrument to stone, but part of a double-handed saw was found at Nimrud (Layard, p. 195, and Dict. Bib., art. \"Saw\"). That saws were in common use and were made of iron is implied in 2 Samuel 12:31], within and without [It is not quite clear whether the meaning is that the two surfaces exposed to view, one within and the other without, the building were shaped with saws, or that the inner and hidden surface of the stone was thus smoothed as well as the exposed parts], even from the foundation unto the coping [or corbels. It is generally agreed (Gesen., Keil, Bight) that the reference is to the \"projecting stones on which the beams rest,\" though Thenius would understand battlements (Deuteronomy 22:8) to be intended. But for these a different word is always used, and the LXX γεῖσος signifies the projection of the roof, not an erection upon it], and so on the outside toward the great court [i.e., the pavement of the court was of sawed stones (see ver. 12).]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones [Bahr says, \"Even the foundations which from without were not seen, were composed of these great stones.\" But the meaning evidently is that the foundation stones were larger than those reared upon them], stones of ten cubits [i.e., ten cubits long, and of proportionate width, etc.], and stones of eight cubits. [The foundations of the palaces, consequently, were much less than those of the temple platform, some of which would measure 16 cubits. See note on 1 Kings 5:17.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And above [i.e., upon the foundation stones just described] were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones [It is implied here that the stones of the superstructure were less than those of the foundation. It is also implied that the former were more carefully smoothed and. faced than the latter] and cedars. [Heb. cedar.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the great court round about [The palace, again like the temple, had two courts. The lesser is referred to in ver. 8, and was enclosed among the buildings. The great court probably surrounded the entire structure] was [enclosed by a wall] with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams [The latter formed the coping. The wall of the court of the palace thus resembled that of the temple. See on 1 Kings 6:36. In all these coincidences we have tokens of the same designing hand], both for the inner court of the house of the Lord. [This sudden digression from the court of the palace to the temple is suspicious, and suggests either a mistranslation or corruption of the text. The historian evidently meant to say that the wall of the court, in its three rows of stones and its cedar coping, resembled the inner court of the temple; and, according to some grammarians (Gesen., Ewald), this meaning may well be conveyed by the text as it stands, ו in Hebrew serving sometimes to institute a comparison (Proverbs 25:3, 12, 20; Proverbs 26:14, etc.) \"As in the court,\" etc. But the instances just cited, being proverbs or apophthegms, are not strictly parallel with our text. It seems better, on the whole, however, to retain the text in this sense than to replace. ו by כ, reading כלחצר or כחצר for ולחצר. כהחצר (Horsley) is quite inadmissible, as the constr, case never has the art.], and for the porch of the house. [It is almost impossible to decide whether the porch of judgment (ver. 7) or the porch of the temple is here meant. The immediate context favours the latter. But this does not seem to have had any court or enclosing wall other than the inner court. Rawlinson decides for the porch of judgment, \"which,\" he says, \"had a planking of cedar over the stone pavement\" (ver. 7). But ver. 7 (where see note) rather excludes than in-eludes the pavement. The reference is probably to the \"court within the porch,\" mentioned in ver. 8.] After this brief account of the royal palaces, the author proceeds to mention the vessels, etc., used in the temple service, prefacing his description by a few words respecting the great Tyrian artist, by whom they were for the most part cast, and possibly designed also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And king Solomon sent [rather, had sent (2 Chronicles 2:13)] and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. [This is our historian's brief version of the transaction which is recorded in 2 Chronicles 2:7-14. He has not mentioned before (1 Kings 5:6) Solomon's request for a master builder. Hiram, like his namesake the king, is elsewhere (2 Chronicles 2:18; 2 Chronicles 4:11, 16) called Huram or Hirom (ver. 40). See note on 1 Kings 5:1. In the first of these passages the king calls him \"Huram my father\" (see note there); in the last he is designated \"Huram his father.\" The title \"Ab\" (cf. Genesis 45:8, 41, 43; 2 Kings 2:12; 2 Kings 5:13; 2 Kings 6:21; cf. 1 Kings 8:9) shows the high esteem in which he was held. It can hardly be, as some have supposed, a proper name. It may signify \"counsellor,\" or master, i.e., master builder. The Tyrians evidently regarded him with some pride.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali [In 2 Chronicles 2:14 he is described as the \"son of a woman of the daughters of Daniel\" The discrepancy is only apparent. For in the first place it is not absolutely necessary to understand by Dan the tribe of that name. It may well refer to the town, formerly Leshem (Joshua 19:47), or Laish (Judges 18:7, 27), colonised by the Danites, and thenceforward bearing their name (ver. 29), which was situated within the borders of Naphtali. If, however, it is preferred to see in the \"daughters of Dan\" a tribal reference, we may suppose (with Keil, al.) that the woman was originally a Danite, but became, through her first husband, \"of the tribe of Naphtali.\" But the first explanation is the more simple and obvious], and his father was a man of Tyre [i.e., Hiram was the son (not stepson, or adopted son, as the Rabbins) of a mixed marriage. In earlier times Laish had but little intercourse with the Zidonians (Judges 18:28). It is nowhere stated that the inhabitants were of Phoenician extraction; nor can it be justly inferred from this passage], a worker in brass [or copper. Brass is a compound of copper and zinc; but נְחשֶׁת originally and strictly signifies a pure metal (Deuteronomy 8:9; Deuteronomy 33:25, etc.; Job 28:2). There were copper mines in Palestine, and the art of working this metal was known at a very remote period (Genesis 4:22, Hebrews, and see Wilkinson's \"Ancient Egypt,\" vol. 3. p. 243; and De Rougemont, \"Age du Bronze,\" p. 180). In later times the word sometimes denoted brass (χαλκός), or copper-bronze Ca mixture of copper and tin). Cf. Jeremiah 6:28. From 2 Chronicles 2:14 we learn that Hiram was \"skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber,\" etc. From the mention of brass only in this passage, and in ver. 45, it has been somewhat hastily concluded that \"the work that he personally did for Solomon\" was \"limited to works in brass\" (Rawlinson). It is, perhaps, safer to say that brass only is mentioned here, because the following section treats exclusively of the brazen ornaments, etc., of the sanctuary (Keil). It would almost seem, however (see note on ver. 48), as if he was not employed to make the vessels of gold. Nor does this supposition really contradict the statement made below, viz., that he wrought all Solomon's work]: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning [or knowledge, as the same word is rendered Exodus 31:3, where similar language is used of Bezaleel. It is noticeable, however, that the words \"filled with the spirit of God,\" used of the Hebrew, are not applied to the Tyrian workman] to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon [probably with a considerable number of assistants], and wrought all his work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For he cast two pillars of brass [The process of casting, as practised by the ancients, receives considerable illustration from the paintings of Thebes (see Wilkinson, \"Anc. Egypt.\" 2 pp. 234, 256; Kitto, \"Daily Bib. Illus.\" Sol. and Kings, pp. 72, 73)], of eighteen cubits high apiece [Heb. eighteen cubits was the height of the one column. This was the height of the shaft (cf. 2 Kings 25:17; Jeremiah 52:21). To this must be added the capital (vers. 16, 19), which measured five (or, according to some, nine) cubits, and probably the pedestal. The pillars were hollow, the metal being four finger breadths thick (Jeremiah 52:21). In 2 Chronicles 3:15 the height is given as thirty-five cubits - a discrepancy which has been variously explained. According to some writers (e.g., Abravanel, Movers, Wordsworth), this represents the total length of the two pillars (each pillar consequently being 17.5 cubits) - an idea which, perhaps, finds some slight support in the word employed אָרֶך length. Here it is ׃תהגךךה קומָה By others it has been supposed that the total height of base, column, and capital was thirty-five cubits, which, if not incredible, is very improbable. Others think it a part of that systematic reduplication of the heights of edifices by the chronicler, of which we have already had an instance in ch. 6. (where see note). But the true explanation would seem to be that, by a clerical error, thirty-five (לה) has been substituted in the text for eighteen (יח). So Keil and Bahr]: and a line [or thread] of twelve cubits did compass either of them [Heb. the second column] about. [It must not be supposed, from the fact that the height of the one column is given, and the circumference of the other, that they were dissimilar in height and breadth or girth. There has probably been an accidental abbreviation of the full expression, \"Eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar.\" It is just possible, however, that the peculiarity results from the actual system of measurement employed in this case. As they were castings, it would be needless to measure both pillars, and so the length may have been ascertained from the first, and the breadth from the second. The columns would thus be about twenty-seven feet high, and about six feet in diameter.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And he made two chapiters [or capitals] of molten [Heb. poured] brass, to put upon the tops [Heb. heads] of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits [In 2 Kings 25:17 the height is given as three cubits; but this is obviously a clerical error. See 2 Chronicles 3:15; Jeremiah 52:22. A much more important question is whether the chapiter (כֹּתֶרֶת same word, akin to כֶּתֶר, crown) of four cubits mentioned in ver. 19 is to be understood as a part of this chapiter, or something additional and superposed, the entablature, e.g. The former appears the more probable. See note on ver. 19. But it is not a fatal objection to the latter view that it would make the entire chapiter, or both members, nine cubits high; no less, that is, than one-half the length of the shaft. No doubt to modern ideas this appears wholly disproportionate; but a double chapiter, bearing the same proportion to the shaft, is found in some of the buildings of Persepolis (Fergusson,. Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457). From the expression of vers. 41, 42, \"the bowls of the chapiters\" (cf. 2 Chronicles 4:12, 13; Jeremiah 52:23), and the word \"belly\" (בֶּטֶן) in ver. 20, we gather that the chapiters were bowl shaped, or bellied out something like the so called \"cushion capital\" in Norman architecture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And nets [Gesen., lattice; Keil, plait. \"It seems almost in vain to try and speculate on what was the exact form of the decoration of these celebrated pillars. The nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, etc., are all features applicable to metal architecture; and though we know that the old Tartar races did use metal architecture everywhere, and especially in bronze, from the very nature of the material, every specimen has perished, and we have now no representations from which we can restore them\" (Fergusson, Dict. Bib. l.c.)] of checker work [the Hebrew repeats the word: nets of network, or plaits of work of plait], and wreaths [or cords, twisted work, i.e., festoons] of chain work [the wreathed or twisted festoon probably resembled a chain], for [or, to, i.e., were on] the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter [The LXX. having here δίκτυον, it is clear that the text they had read שבכה \"a net,\" and not שבעה \"seven.\" Some, accordingly, would read, \"a net for the one chapiter, and a net,\" etc. But there is no sufficient reason for the change. \"This decoration consisted of seven twists arranged as festoons, which were hung round the capitals of the pillars\" (Keil). The comparison with \"chain work\" was probably suggestd by the fact that the intertwined threads, which crossed and recrossed each other, bore a rough resemblance to the links of a chain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And he made the pillars [There is evidently a confusion of the text here. Probably we should read, with some MSS. הרמנים, the pomegranates (so LXX.), instead of העמודים, or rather, we should transpose the two words, reading pomegranates where the Masoretic text has pillars, and vice versa. \"The pomegranate was one of the commonest ornaments of Assyria.... It is doubtful whether a symbolical meaning was attached to it, or whether it was merely selected as a beautiful natural form\" (Rawlinson). Wordsworth characteristically sees in its many ripe seeds, \"an expressive emblem of fruitfulness in good works.\" According to Bahr, it is an image of the law or covenant of Jehovah, and the seeds represent the separate commands (Symbolik, 2:122, 123). In the tabernacle it was pourtrayed in works of divers colours on the hem of the robe of the ephod (Exodus 28:33, 34; Exodus 39:24). All the Scripture notices of this fruit prove its great abundance in Palestine (Numbers 13:23; Joshua 15:32; Joshua 21:25 ; - in the two last passages it appears as the name of a town - Song of Solomon 4:3, 13; Song of Solomon 8:2; Joel 1:12; Haggai 2:9, etc.) It was also well known to the Egyptians (Numbers 20:5)], and [or even] two rows round about upon the one network [\"The relation between the two rows of pomegranates and the plaited work is not clearly defined, but it is generally and correctly assumed that one row ran round the pillars below the plaited work and the other above\" (Keil). The pomegranates, one hundred in number in each row (2 Chronicles 3:16), four hundred in all (2 Chronicles 4:13; Jeremiah 52:23), would thus form a double border to the chain work], to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates [rather, on the top of the pillars, as the transposition mentioned above and the sense require]; and so did he for the other chapiter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars [It is difficult to believe that these words, which are identical with those in vers. 16, 17,18, can refer to a different - a second and superposed capital (Rawlinson), or to the entablature (Fergusson)] were of lily work [i.e., bassirelievi in imitation of flowering lilies. Probably the bowl-shaped chapiter was treated as a fullblown lily, just as the capitals of Egyptian pillars took the form of the lotus. The molten sea was similarly treated (ver. 26). The lily (שׁוּשַׁן), from שׁוּשׁ), to be white), was undoubtedly an emblem of purity. Bahr observes that it may justly be named \"the flower of the promised land,\" and that as the lotus was the religious flower of the Indian and Egyptian religions, so was the lily of the Jewish] in the porch [These words, בָּאוּלָם, are very obscure. Keil understands\" as in the hall\" (cf. κατὰ τὸ αὐλὰμ, LXX.) But that idea would have been expressed by כָּאוּלָם, and nothing is said elsewhere about any lily work in the porch (Bahr). Ewald, too, thinks the decoration of the porch is referred to, and holds that a description of this lily work must once have preceded this statement, though it is now wanting. Thenius, al. suppose them to refer to the position of the pillars within the porch, and the \"four cubits\" mentioned presently, they take to indicate the diameter of the capitals. Wordsworth would render \"inside or toward the porch,\" and understands that the lily work was only on the inside of the pillars. It is, perhaps, impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion], four cubits. [This may either mean that of five cubits (which was the height of the entire capital), four, and these the upper four (ver. 22), were covered with lily work, while one cubit at the bottom of the capital was ornamented with chain-work or festeons - we can hardly believe that nets, chains, and lily work were all combined in the same space, or it may refer to the position of the pillars in the portico.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates [Instead of the italics, Keil would supply Hiram made, but it is doubtful whether this is any improvement. We have already heard more than once that he made the chapiters. It is better to supply projected or were, as in the preceding verse. This verse is extremely obscure; but its design appears to be to explain how the bowl of the chapiter projected above its base] also above [i.e., above the neck, or lowest cubit, on which was the net and chain work], over against [מִלְּעֻמַּת with two prefixes is a rare form] the belly [or \"bowl\" (ver. 41)] which was by [Heb. beyond, on the other side of, i.e., as it appeared to a spectator standing below] the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows [This agrees with the total of four hundred, as given in ver. 42, and in 2 Chronicles, and with the \"hundred round about\" (i.e., the number in each row) mentioned in Jeremiah 52:23. We gather from this latter passage that ninety-six out of the hundred faced the four quarters, for this is apparently the meaning of רוּחָה, windwards; see Ezekiel 42:16-18, not that the pomegranates could be \"set in motion by the play of the wind,\" as Ewald confidently affirms. The remaining four pomegranates, of course, occupied the four corners. The necessary inference from this statement, viz., that this part of the capital was foursquare, seems to have escaped the notice of the commentators] round about upon the other chapiter. [Some words have evidently dropped out of the Hebrew here, as in ver. 15. The text, no doubt, originally stood \"two hundred in rows round about the one chapiter, and two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.\" There has been no intentional compression that is not the genius of the Semitic languages - but an accidental omission, occasioned by the recurrence of almost identical words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21 - And he set up the pillars in the porch [We are now confronted by the much vexed questions,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) What was the position, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) what the purpose, of these two columns?NEWLINENEWLINEWere they in the porch, or before it? And were they architectural or monumental? Did they support the roof of the porch, or were they isolated and detached, after the manner of obelisks? I incline to the opinion of Bahr, that they stood in the porch, but that they formed no part of the building, i.e., that they were not for any structural use, but simply for ornament. This appears to me, on the whole, to result from the following considerations:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The language used favours a position within the porch. We have here לְאֻלָם ( = \"at or in the porch,\" perhaps for the porch, as Bahr), and in ver. 19 (where see note) בָּאוּלָם. And with this agree the expression of the Chronicles \"before (לִפְגֵי) the house,\" and \"before (עַל־פְּנֵי) the temple\" (2 Chronicles 3:15, 17). The pillars would, however, be \"before the temple,\" whether they stood within or in front of the porch, and it may be safely allowed that the language of the historian is not decisive one way or the other. The prepositions of the text, however, seem to lend some support to Bahr's view.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) We know that the Phoenicians used isolated metal columns as sacred ornaments, so that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation\" (Rawlinson). \"Whenever in coins or histories we get a representation of a Phoenician temple, it always has a pillar or pillars standing within or before it\" (Stanley).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) It is extremely doubtful whether these columns, twenty-three feet in height, were adapted to serve as supports to the roof of the porch. The height of the latter has been variously estimated at twenty, thirty, and sixty cubits, and whichever estimate is preferred, the columns would appear to be of an unsuitable altitude. Fergusson says they were \"appropriate to support the roof of the porch,\" but then he conceives the columns to be in all twenty-seven cubits high (see on ver. 19), and allows the remaining three cubits for the slope of the roof). But, as we cannot be certain either of the height of the porch or of the column, this is an argument of which very little can be made.NEWLINENEWLINE(4) If the pillars were part of the building, they would almost certainly have been of the same material, i.e., wood or stone. Their metallic composition is certainly an argument for their monumental character. It can hardly be alleged in favour of this view, however, that they are mentioned amongst the vessels or articles of furniture, for the historian might fittingly describe the pillars here, as being the principal of the \"works in brass\" which Hiram wrought, even if they did form the supports of the roof of the porch. Nor are we justified, considering the extreme brevity and the partial character of the description of the temple, in affirming that they would have been mentioned in connexion with the building, had they formed part of the edifice.NEWLINENEWLINE(5) The remark of Stieglitz (cited by Bahr) that \"it was their separate position alone which gave these pillars the impressive aspect they were designed to wear,\" lends some little support to this view. So also doesNEWLINENEWLINE(6) The fact that these columns and these alone, received special names. \"No architectural portion of the building received a name\" (Keil). But this argument, again, is not too unduly pressed, for to some it may seem that the names they bore would have a special propriety and an enhanced significance, if the columns contributed to the strength and stability of the edifice. The question, therefore, is one of considerable complexity, the more so, as it is maintained that it would be almost impossible to construct a roof thirty feet in width without some such pillars to support the beam (Fergusson); but the balance of evidence appears to favour the view that Jachin and Boaz were monuments erected in the porch, to dignify the sanctuary, and to symbolize the power and eternity of the Being to whom it was dedicated]: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin [i.e., he shall establish, as marg. The name expressed the belief that God would preserve and protect the new lane. It is true that a Jachin is mentioned (1 Chronicles 9:10; 1 Chronicles 24:17), as head of the 21st course of priests in the reign of David, while a Boaz was one of Solomon's ancestors, but the columns could hardly be named after them, or an private persons. Ewald suggests that they were named after \"some favourites of the time, perhaps young sons of Solon on.\" The idea of Thenius that these names were engraved upon the pillars is not wholly improbable, though of course it finds no support in the text] and he set up the left pillar [the left as one faced them from the house. The right hand is identified with the south in ver. 39], and called the name thereof Boaz. [Marg. in it is strength. Probably \"in Him, i.e., God, is its strength\" (cf. Isaiah 45:24). The thought of Jachin, \"He will establish,\" is thus continued; and the two pillars pointed alike to the God of Israel as the true support and upholder of His sanctuary. The LXX. interpretation of these two names, Κατόρθωσις and Ἰσχός (2 Chronicles 3:17), success and strength, though very far from literal, preserves their fundamental ideas.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And upon the top of the pillars was lily work [a repetition, in the Hebrew manner, of ver. 19. The \"lily work,\" which probably involved two things,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the capital had a rude resemblance to a \"full blown lily cup\" (Bahr), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that representations of the leaf of the lily ere pourtrayed upon it (as in the cornice of Hersepolis, an illustration of which will be found Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457), was a not unfitting finial to the column, as it formed a sort of crown or chaplet upon it. The two pillars would thus resemble two giant plants, the column answering to the stalk, the capital to the flower. The ideas of architecture, it is well known, have very frequently been derived from the vegetable kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The writer now passes on to describe the brazen vessels made by Hiram for the temple use.

Keil thinks it was introduced to explain the mention of oxen] compassing [Heb. surrounding, some word] it, ten in a cubit [It does not follow from this that each gourd or knop was \"a little over two inches in diameter \" (Keil), for they may not have been in close contact, and, moreover the cubit was probably 18 inches], compassing the sea round about : the ]mops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

Bahr, Symbolik, 1:201 sqq. Like seven, it is compounded out of three and four. But the primary reference here is to the twelve tribes], three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east [So the tribes in the camp formed a square round the tabernacle, three on each side - east, south, west, and north (Numbers 2.)]: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. The same regard of the cardinal points (see Bahr, Symbolik, 1:210 sqq.) has been noticed in the pomegranates on the capitals of the two columns. See note on ver. 20. Keil says the feet of the oxen no doubt rested on a metal plate, so that they were fixed and immoveable; but this lacks proof. The oxen would be immovable in any case, owing to the weight of the metal and the water. All conjectures as to the height and size of the oxen are necessarily of little value.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And it was a handbreadth thick [i.e., three inches], and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup [Heb. and his lip like the work of the lip of a cup, i.e., curved outwards], with flowers of lilies [lit., \"a blossom of lily.\" Keil understands \"ornamented with lily flowers,\" but the strict interpretation the \"lily blossom\" being in apposition to \"cup\" - requires us to refer the words to the shape rather than to the ornamentation of the laver. The lip was curved like a lily]: it contained two thousand [In Chronicles and by Josephus the number is given as 3000. This may have resulted, as Keil thinks, from confounding ג and ב but it is suspicious that so many of the numbers of the Chronicles are exaggerations. The common explanation of the discrepancy, viz., that it held 2000 baths \"when filled to its ordinary height, but when filled to the brim 3000\" (Wordsworth), appears to me hardly ingenuous] baths. [\"The data for determining the value of the bath or ephah are both scanty and conflicting\" (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1741). Josephus, the only authority on the subject, says that it equalled the Attic metretes (about 8.5 gals.), but it is very doubtful whether he was \"really familiar with the Greek measures\" (ib.) At any rate, if this statement is correct, his other statement as to the shape of the laver must be altogether erroneous, since 2000 baths would equal 17,000 gals., and a hemispherical laver could not possibly have contained more than 10,000. The attempt has been made, on the assumption that the sea was a hemisphere, as Josephus affirms, to calculate from its capacity the value of the bath, which in that case would be about four gallons. But there is good reason for doubting whether the laver was hemispherical - such a shape would be ill adapted to its position on the backs of oxen - and some have maintained that it was cylindrical, others that, like the laver of the tabernacle, it had a foot (Exodus 30:18) or basin. The prevailing opinion of scholars, however, appears to be that it was 30 cubits in circumference only at the lip, and that it bellied out considerably below. While the shape, however, must remain a matter of uncertainty, we are left in no doubt as to its purpose. It was \"for the priests to wash in\" (2 Chronicles 4:6) - not, of course, for immersing their whole persons, but their hands and feet (Exodus 30:19, 21). The priests (after Exodus 3:5; Joshua 5:15, etc.) ministered barefoot. It was, according to Rabbinical tradition, provided with taps or faucets (Bahr). It has, however, been held by some that the water issued forth (as in the Alhambra) from the lions' mouths. It is probable that a basin of some sort was attached to it. Whether the laver was filled by the hand or by some special contrivance, it is quite impossible to say. We know that provision was made for storing water hard by. The present writer was privileged in 1861 to explore the great reservoir, the Bahr el Khebir, still existing underneath the Haram area, at a time when very few Europeans had seen it (see Pal. Explor. Fund, No. 7; Barclay, \"City of the Great King;\" Porter, Handbook, 1. pp. 134, 138). The water was probably brought from Solomon's pools at Bethlehem, though \"a fountain of water exists in the city and is running unto this day, far below the surface\" (\"Our Work in Palestine,\" p. 103). Tacitus mentions the fens perennis aquae and the piscinae cisternaeque servandis imbribus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And he made ten bases [or stands, מְכונות, from כּוּן, erectus stetit. The description of both the bases and the layers which they supported (vers. 27-39) is extremely obscure. We know, however, that the bases (as the name implies) were simply stands or pediments for the lavers] of brass; four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof; and three cubits the height of it [they were rectangular, or box shaped, six feet square and four and a half feet high.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And the work of the bases was on this manner [Heb. and this the work of the base]: they had borders [מִסְגְּרֹת (from סָגַר clausit) means strictly enclosings, i.e., sides, forming the stand. They were panels, because of the borders or ledges [mentioned presently, but this was the accident of their construction. The translation \"border\" gives a totally wrong impression], and the borders were between the ledges [Heb. the sides were between the borders, i.e., were enclosed by ledges or frames.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And on the borders [panels] that were between the ledges were lions [i.e., figures or bas-reliefs of lions], oxen, and cherubims [\"The lion and the ox are the two animal forms which occur most frequently in Assyrian decoration\" (Rawlinson). They have also found a place through the cherubim, in the symbolism of Christianity]: and upon the ledges there was a base above [i.e., there was a pedestal or stand (כֵּן; see ver. 31) of some sort for the laver upon the square basis]: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions [Heb. wreaths, festoons, לִוְיָה. (cf. Proverbs 1:9), corona] made of thin work. [Heb. pensile or hanging work, מורָד from יָרַד descendit; Vulgate, dependentia. It would seem that on the panel, beneath the figures of animals, etc., were sculptured hanging festoons of flowers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And every base had four brazen wheels [As the lavers were used for washing \"such things as they offered for burnt offering\" (2 Chronicles 4:6), and consequently would require to be continually emptied and refilled, they must of necessity be moveable, so that they could be taken, now to the sea, or other reservoir, now to the altar], and plates [Heb. axles] of brass: and the four corners [Heb. feet; פַּעַם signifies step, thence foot, and is here used of artificial feet. These were, no doubt, at the four corners, and served to raise the stand above the wheels, so that the foliage, etc., was not hidden] thereof had undersetters [Heb. shoulders. \"The bearings of the axle\" (Gesen.) must be meant. The bases had four feet, which apparently terminated in a sort of socket or fork, into which the axletrees were inserted]: under the laver were under setters [Heb. the shoulders] molten [or cast], at the side of every addition. [Lit., opposite to a man (i.e., each) were wreaths. The explanation of Keil is that \"from the feet., there ascended shoulder pieces, which ran along the outside of the chest and reached to the lower part of the basin, which was upon the lid of the chest, and, as shoulders, either supported or helped to support it.\" He thus understands the \"shoulder\" to extend from the foot, or axletree, to the bottom of the laver. But it seems quite as likely that these shoulders were within the stand; that they started from its upper corners, i.e., \"from under the laver\" (as in the Hebrew), passed down along its inner angles, and emerged below - the stand may well have had no bottom - in the shape of feet or forks, which rested on the axletrees, and supported both stand and ]aver. Over against this internal shoulder blade or support was placed externally a wreath. But Bahr despairs of arriving at any just and adequate understanding of this arrangement, and, in the absence of drawings, it is perhaps hopeless that we shall ever interpret the words with certainty.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And the mouth of it [Heb. his mouth. I incline, with Keil, to think the mouth of the laver just mentioned (כִּיֹר masc.) is referred to rather than the stand (Thenius), which would require a fern. suffix] within the chapiter [By this we are, perhaps, to understand a round ornament, resembling the capital of a pillar, which stood in the centre of the dome-shaped covering (see ver. 35) of the stand, and on which the laver rested (so Keil, Bahr). Rawlinson says, \"No commentator has given a satisfactory explanation of this passage \"]: and above [Heb. upwards] was a cubit [i.e., the neck or foot of the laver measured uniformly one cubit, in width apparently]: but the mouth [Heb. and her mouth, fern. This last mentioned mouth is probably the mouth of the capital (fern.) The neck or mouth of the laver would appear to have been fitted into the mouth of the crown-shaped pedestal] was round after the work of the base [Heb. stand work, כֵּן here fixes the meaning of the word in ver. 29, i.e., it decides it to be the substantive (Keil, after Chald.), not the adverb (as Thenius, Bahr, al.) a cubit and a half [so that the first mouth would fit easily into the second], and also upon the mouth of it [Heb. her mouth, that of the capital, which was external. The mouth of the laver was partially concealed] were gravings [Keil understands this of the carving of the stand already mentioned, ver. 29. But a mouth is mentioned, which the square stand lacked. Besides the word \"also\" points to additional carvings. I understand the chapiter which formed the mouth of the stand to be meant] with [Heb. and] their borders, foursquare, not round.

It would be more correct to say that the wheels did not cover any portion of the sides; they were under them]; and the axletrees [Heb. hands, as holding the wheel to the base or stand. Axletrees is altogether misleading. The hands were the parts connecting the wheels and axles] of the wheels were joined to [Heb. in, as marg.] the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.

He derives גַּב gibbus, from גָּבַב curvatus est] , and their felloes [or fellies, as the word is now written. These axe the parts which compose the circumference of the wheel; but Gesen. translates spokes, because they are the joinings (חַָשק conjunxit) of nave and rim] and their spokes [חִשֻּׁרִים Gesen. would render naves, because the spokes collect at that part], were all molten.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - And there were four under setters [it seems probable that this is not a repetition of ver. 30 (Rawlinson), but that the reference is to the upper part (cf. ver. 35) of the shoulder pieces, which, according to Keil's view, supported the laver] to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself. [Heb. from the base, its shoulders. Whether these words mean that the shoulders projected from the base, that \"they rose above the corners with a slight curve\" (Keil), or that they were cast with the base, i.e., from the same mould, as in the next verse, it is impossible to say.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - And in the top [Heb. head] of the base was there a round compass [Probably \"the base above\" (ver. 29)or stand for the laver. This was apparently arched to the height of nine inches above the top of the base] of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges [Heb. hands. These can hardly be either \"the hands of the wheels\" (ver. 32) or the \"shoulders\" of ver. 30 or ver. 34, but what they were it is difficult to say.

But see on ver. 26]: and every laver was four cubits. [It is uncertain whether the height or the diameter is meant. Keil decides for the latter - and four cubits, the width of the sides of the stand, may well have been also the diameter of the basin - on the ground that as\" the basins were set upon (עַל) the stands,\" it can hardly refer to the height. But it is worthy of remark that \"the height of all the ether parts has been mentioned\" (Rawlinson). See vers. 27, 32, 35, and without this particular we could not calculate the entire height, which, if the laver were four cubits, would be about thirteen feet. This surprising size is accounted for by remembering the height of the altar, to which the fat and other sacrificial portions had to be transferred from the laver]: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. [Ten layers would not be at all too many when we remember the prodigious number of victims which were occasionally offered.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - And he put five bases on the right side [Heb. shoulder] of the house, and five on the left side of the house [i.e., on the south and north sides of the court of the priests]: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. [This passage is decisive as to which was the right and which the left. The right side was the south. It was probably for convenience that the sea did not stand due east of the house, i.e., between the porch and altar.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - And Hiram made the layers [So the Rec. Text. But perhaps we ought to read סִירות i.e., pots, here, as in ver. 45 and 2 Chronicles 4:11. This word is joined with shovels and basons, not only in these two passages, but also in Exodus 27:3, 2 Kings 25:14, Jeremiah 52:18; in other words, the appropriate term in this connexion would be \"pots,\" while \"layers,\" having been just mentioned in ver. 38, would involve an idle repetition. Altogether, therefore, there can be little doubt that we should here read הסירות for הכירות. It is apparently the reading of the Chald., LXX., and some MSS. These\" pots \"were used, not for carrying away the ashes (Keil), but, as the name implies (סִיר, effervescere), for boiling the flesh of the peace offering (1 Samuel 2:13, 14), and the shovels [these, again, as the name implies (יָע from יָעָה abstulit; see Gesen., Thesaurus, p. 607), were used for taking away the ashes from the altar (Exodus 27:3; Numbers 4:14), and the basons.

A chapiter could hardly be correctly described as עַל־פְּנֵי הע. It is probable that this is a clerical error, and that we should read עַל־פְּנֵי הע (Bahr, Keil), \"upon the two pillars.\" So LXX. ἐπ ἀμφοτέροις κ.τ.λ.

It is true thin latter is the reading of some MSS., and is followed by the Syr. and Vulg., but it can easily be accounted for, being a repetition of the last words of ver. 41, while it fails to account, as the first named emendation does, for the עַל־פְנֵי.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings7:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43.

Joshua 13:27, where it allotted to the tribe of Gad); \"and indeed it has been recovered, under its later name Tarala, at Tell Dar'ala, northeast of the Damieh ford\" (Condor, p. 229). As Zarthan was almost certainly west of the Jordan, and as the casting - from the nature of the country - must as certainly have been done to the west of the river it is somewhat surprising to find a trans-Jordanie town mentioned as one of the landmarks defining the site. It is possible that there was a western Succoth - a place named Sakut was discovered by Robinson and Van de velde, a few miles south of Bethshean; but this name is radically different (Conder). It is, therefore, more probable that, being near the ford of the river this place was so well known that it would serve better than any of the less familiar western towns to identify the site of the foundry] and Zarthan.

These latter, as became the furniture of a house which blazed in gold, were all of gold, while the former were of brass.

These latter, however, were of brass, while those of the text were of pure gold. According to 2 Chronicles 4:8, they were a hundred in number.

Keil thinks they were for the wine of the libations], and the spoons [כַּפות, lit., palms (of hands), hence used of shallow vessels (Exodus 25:29; Numbers 7:84, 86.

Cf. 26:26-28]; even the surer, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the Lord.

But the precise date of the dedication is a matter of dispute and uncertainty. We know that it took place in the seventh month of the year, but of what year we cannot be so sure. Was it the same year in the eighth month of which (1 Kings 6:38) the house was finished (Ewald)? Was the dedication, that is to say, one month anterior to the completion of the house and its appointments? Or are we to understand \"the seventh month\" to mean the Ethanim of the following year (Bahr)? are we to assign the dedication, that is, to a date eleven months after completion? Or, finally, are we to believe with the Vat. LXX. μετὰ ἔικοσι ἔτη (the LXX. text is here, however, in great confusion), that the temple was not dedicated until the palaces were also built (see 1 Kings 9:1-9); are we to hold, i.e., that though finished and ready for use, it remained unused for a period of thirteen years (Thenius, Keil)? These are questions which we cannot perhaps answer with absolute certainty, but, to my mind, every consideration is in favour of the date first mentioned, i.e., the seventh month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign. It is true Bahr says that this opinion \"needs no refutation,\" while Keil pronounces it directly at variance with 1 Kings 7:51.\" But it is worth while to inquire whether this is so? And, first, as to the bearing of the passage just cited, \"So was ended all the work which,\" etc., taken in connexion with 1 Kings 8:1, \"Then Solomon assembled,\" etc. To the cursory reader it appears no doubt as it this \"then\" must refer to the completion of the work of which we have just heard, and which was not effected until the eighth month of the year (1 Kings 6:38). ButNEWLINENEWLINE(1) אָז though probably a mark of time ( = tune), is clearly a word of great latitude of meaning, and may apply as well to one month before completion (the time specified in 1 Kings 7:51) as to eleven months after; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) it would be quite consistent with the usus loquendi of the sacred writers to describe the temple as finished, when in reality it was incomplete in a few minor particulars (De minimis non curat scriptura). Further more, if the temple was finished in every detail, and in all its furniture and appointments, in the eighth month, as we learn from 1 Kings 6:38, we may be perfectly sure it would or could be practically finished - finished so as to be ready for consecration - by the seventh month. Indeed, it is not an unreasonable presumption, that it hardly would be perfect and complete on the day of dedication. Those who have built or restored churches, not to speak of cathedrals, which would perhaps afford a closer analogy to the temple, know how extremely difficult, if not impossible, it is to have every detail finished and arranged for the day of consecration. Some few accidental omissions will have to be supplied afterwards, or experience will suggest certain alterations and improvements which have to be made. There is no inherent improbability, therefore, that the temple should be dedicated in the seventh month, though it was not finished לְכָל דְּבָרָיו until the eighth month, i.e., three or four weeks later. And there was a strong reason why the dedication should take place at the earliest possible date. There had been a long period of preparation, extending back into the preceding reign (1 Chronicles 28, 29.); the dedication consequently had long been eagerly looked for; moreover the erection had evidently been hurried forward, a prodigious number of labourers having been employed in order to expedite the work. It is almost inconceivable, therefore, that, after these energetic measures had been taken, either the king or the nation should have been content to wait thirteen years - nearly twice the time it had taken to build the temple - until the palaces, which were entirely independent and secular buildings, were also completed. If the great national sanctuary, which was the glory of the land, was ready for use, as we know it was, we can hardly believe, considering the natural eagerness and impatience of men, that the tribes of Israel, or their ambitious monarch, would, of their own choice, defer the consecration for an indefinite number of years. It would appear consequently that it is the view that the dedication was postponed for thirteen years \"hardly needs discussion\" (see below on 1 Kings 9:1). And the same considerations apply, though perhaps with diminished force, to their waiting one year. For if it be said that the delay was occasioned by the desire to connect the dedication with the feast of tabernacles, which was par excellence the feast of the year (הֶחָג) the answer is that it is more likely that the work would be hurried on by the employment of additional hands, if need be, or that the edifice would be consecrated, though not complete in all its details, at the feast of the eleventh year, than that, for the sake of one month, they should wait eleven months. And if the objection be raised that a feeling of religious awe would forbid the dedication of an imperfect building, or of a perfect building with imperfect arrangements, it is easy to reply that both building and furniture may have been practically complete, and may have been believed at the time to be perfect, but that the experience of the first few days suggested a few alterations or additions which threw the completion of the work in all its particulars into the eighth month. It is worthy of notice that Josephus distinctly states that the dedication was in the seventh month of the eighth year (Ant. 8:04. 1) ] Solomon assembled [יַקְהֵל. See Ewald, 233 b] the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief [Heb. princes] of the fathers of the children of Israel. [This great assembly (compare Daniel 3:2) can hardly be said to have been suggested to Solomon by the precedent afforded by David (Keil), when bringing up the ark (2 Samuel 6:1), for it was only natural that he should summon the representatives of the people to witness an event of such profound importance in the national history, as the dedication, after years of waiting (2 Samuel 7:6-13), of a national sanctuary intended to supersede the tabernacle, at which for five centuries their forefathers had worshipped. And the more so, as they had been called together by David to con-salt about the erection (1 Chronicles 28:1), and had offered willingly of their treasures (1 Chronicles 29:6-9) towards its decoration. It is inconceivable, therefore, that the temple of the Jews could have been formally opened, except in the presence of the \"elders and heads of the tribes.\" Nor can we (with Rawlinson) see a contrast between the more popular proceedings of David, who \"gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand (2 Samuel 6:1), and the statelier, more aristocratic system of his son, who merely summons the chief men;\" for Solomon's \"eiders,\" etc. (Deuteronomy 16:18; 1 Samuel 16:4; 1 Samuel 30:26-31), may well have equalled David's \"chosen men\" in number. It is quite likely that there was more formality and stateliness in this latter ease, but it was practically the same class of persons, i.e., the leading men by birth, talents, or prowess, that were present on both occasions. In fact, it was the Jewish Church by representation] unto King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up [Heb. to bring up] the ark of the covenant of the Lord [so called because it contained the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with the children of Israel (ver. 9). The temple being really, or principally, a receptacle for the ark, the removal of this venerated relic to its place in the oracle is narrated first, as being of the first importance] out of the city of David, which is Zion. [Cf. 2 Samuel 6:12, 17.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And all the men of Israel [not all the heads of the tribes just mentioned (ver. 1), as Keil, but all who came to the feast, as every male Israelite was under obligation to do (Deuteronomy 16:16) ] assembled themselves unto King Solomon at the feast [the Heb. word הֶחָג (with the art.) always means the feast of tabernacles. The same word is used of the feast of passover (Exodus 23:15) and pentecost (ib. ver. 16), but \"the feast\" here can only mean that of tabernacles. As the \"feast of ingathering\" (Exodus 23:16), as commemorating the deliverance from Egypt (Leviticus 23:43), and as peculiarly a social festival (ib. vers. 40-42; Numbers 29:12 sqq.), it was the most joyous as well as the greatest (?Jos., Ant. 8:04. 1) gathering of the year. (Compare the Jewish saying of a later date: \"He who has never seen the rejoicing at the pouring out of the water of Siloam, has never seen rejoicing in his life.\") It was doubtless for this reason that tabernacles was selected for the dedication. A special feast of dedication, however, was held for seven days before the feast of tabernacles proper commenced (see on ver. 65). It did not displace that great feast, however (Stanley), but simply preceded it. It is worthy of notice that Jeroboam selected the same feast (1 Kings 12:32) for the inauguration of his new cultus. The idea of Josephus, that the feast of tabernacles \"happened to coincide with the dedication\" hardly seems probable] in the month Ethanim [variously interpreted to mean gifts, i.e., fruits (Thenius), flowing streams (Gesenius) - it falls about the time of the early rains - and equinox (Bottcher) ], which is the seventh month. [This is added because the month was subsequently known as Tisri (see on 1 Kings 6:1), or to show that \"the feast\" was the feast of tabernacles.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And all the elders of Israel came [Not a mere repetition. The men who were summoned to Jerusalem (ver. 1) were all present, of their own accord, to witness the removal], and the priests took up the ark. tin the parallel account in 2 Chronicles 5:4, we read that \"the Levites took up the ark.\" But there is no contradiction, as has been too readily supposed. For ver. 7 of the Chronicles,\" the priests brought in the ark,\" etc., confirms the statement of the text. And the explanation is suggested in ver. 5 of the same chapter, \"These did the priests, the Levites (so the Heb.) bring up.\" Same expression in Joshua 3:3. All the priests were Levites - Keil translates, \"the Levitical priests\" - and this somewhat singular expression is no doubt used to remind us that such was the case. Nor need it cause us any surprise to find the priests employed in this service. It is true that the ark was given into the charge of the Kohathite Levites (Numbers 3:30, 31); and it was their duty to bear it (Numbers 4:15; Numbers 7:9; Numbers 10:21; cf. 1 Chronicles 15:2, 11, 12). But the real care and supervision of the ark always belonged to the sons of Aaron. It was their office, e.g., to put on or take off the covering of the ark and of the vessels, which the Levites were forbidden directly to touch (Numbers 4:5-15). It was quite in accordance with the spirit of these provisions that Solomon now entrusted the carriage of the ark to the superior order. But more than that, Solomon was not without precedent to justify his choice, indeed, we may see in his selection of the priests a minute mark of truth, amounting almost to an undo-signed coincidence. For we find that on occasions of extraordinary solemnity - at the crossing of the Jordan, e.g., (Joshua 3:6, 15, 17), and at the siege of Jericho (Joshua 6:6), the priests had borne the ark (cf. 1 Samuel 4:4; 1 Chronicles 15:11, 12). It was no doubt these familiar precedents guided Solomon, or the ecclesiastical authorities, in their selection of the priests on this occasion. A \"settled place,\" a \"house of cedars\" (2 Samuel 7:7), \"having now been found for the ark\" to abide in, after it had \"dwelt in curtains\" for 500 years, it was taking its last journey, and in order to mark this journey as exceptional, in order to show both the ark and the house the greater reverence, it was determined that it should be borne for the last time by the priests. Keil suggests that the ark may have been uncovered, but this is very improbable. Why, we may ask, were coverings provided, and their use prescribed (Numbers 4:5-15), if they were to be arbitrarily dispensed with? He also adds that Levites were not allowed to enter the most holy place. But neither, it may be added, was this lawful for the priests. Levites and priests might enter that day, because the house was not then dedicated. The cloud (ver. 10) claimed it for God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And they brought up the ark of the Lord [which had now been for nearly 40 years \"in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it\" on the Mount Zion (2 Samuel 6:17) ], and the tabernacle of the congregation [Heb, \"the tabernacle of meeting\" (Exodus 29:42, 46. See Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1414; Bahr, Symbolik, 1:80, 81). This had been for many years at Gibeon. (Cf. ch. 3:4; 2 Chronicles 1:8; 1 Chronicles 16:39. See note on ch. 3:4.) The tabernacle of Mount Zion is never called \"the tabernacle of the congregation\" - indeed, it is expressly dis-tingnished from it, 2 Chronicles 1:3, 4. The ark and the tabernacle were now reunited in the temple of Solomon, thus \"marking the identity and continuity of the life and ritual of the Hebrew Church\" (Wordsworth) ], and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle [Perhaps the brazen altar. Certainly the altar of incense, the table of shewbread, the candlestick, and also the brazen serpent (Stanley) ], even those did the priests and Levites bring up. [We are hardly justified in saying (as Keil, al.) that the Levites carried all but the ark. The text rather favours the view that the priests assisted in bringing up the tabernacle and its furniture. So 2 Chronicles 5:5. Neither the tabernacle nor its vessels were designed for further use in the temple; the latter had been replaced by vessels better suited to the enlarged sanctuary - they were simply preserved, so far as we know, as relics of the past. in the treasury or side chambers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him were with him; before the ark [Prayers and sacrifices alike were offered toward the mercy seat (Psalm 28:2; cf. Exodus 25:22) ], sacrificing sheep and oxen [apparently the ark festal en route (cf. 2 Samuel 6:18) whilst the sacrifices were offered. The object of the sacrifice was to testify the grateful joy of the people at the proximate realization of their hopes. There may have been also in the background the idea of averting the Divine anger, of making a propitiation for possible errors and imperfections in their service. There were tragedies connected with the removal of the ark in time past (1 Samuel 4:17; 1 Samuel 6:19; 2 Samuel 6:7) which, we may be sure, were not altogether forgotten on this occasion] that could not be told or numbered for multitude. [Cf. 2 Samuel 6:13. But the sacrifices on that occasion were on a much smaller scale (1 Chronicles 15:26).

Whether the ark stood with its length east and west, or north and south, it is somewhat difficult to decide. But see on ver. 8]. Ver 7. - For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered [יָסֹכוּ from סָכַך texit; hence, סֻכָּה, booth; LXX. περιεκάλυπτον, i.e., overshadowed and concealed. This word is of some importance as showing that the ark would thenceforward and always be in complete darkness, under the outstretched wings of the cherubim - a fact which suggests the true explanation of the following verse] the ark and the staves thereof above [Heb. from above].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And they drew out [It is uncertain whether יַאֲרִכוּ is transitive, as our A.V. renders it, and as in 1 Kings 3:14 = lengthen, in which case, however, it should almost be followed by אֵת, or intransitive, as in Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16; Deuteronomy 25:15, when the meaning would be, \"The staves were long,\" but the latter rendering has the support of most scholars. As the oracle in the tabernacle was a cube of ten cubits, they cannot have been more than eight or nine cubits, and it is doubtful whether, the ark being only 2.5 cubits, they would be so long. Their length is mentioned in order to account for the ends being seen. It is immaterial to the meaning of the passage, however, which interpretation we put upon this verb. If we adhere to the A.V. then we must understand that, as it was forbidden to remove the staves from the rings at the corners of the ark (Exodus 25:12-15), they drew the staves forward towards one end of the ark; that they removed the staves altogether from the ark (Stanley) is a view to which the text lends no support] the staves, that the ends [Heb. heads. It is possible the ends of the staves were fitted with knobs. This would prevent their removal] of the staves were seen out in [Heb. from] the holy place [Marg. ark, the word found in the Chronicles v.9. It is questionable, however, whether הַקֹּדֶשׁ is ever used, by itself, of the ark (Gesen., Thesaurus, s.v.) It may be used of the most holy place (see on ver. 10), but here it would appear to designate the הֵיכָל (1 Kings 6:17), the body or \"temple of the house\" (Exodus 26:33; Hebrews 9:2). Its meaning appears to be so defined by the next words] before the oracle [i.e., a person standing in the holy place, but at the west end, near the entrance to the oracle (1 Kings 6:31), could see the ends of the staves. Several questions of considerable nicety suggest themselves here.NEWLINENEWLINE1. What was the position of the ark? Did it stand, that is to say, east and west, or north and south under the wings of the cherubim?NEWLINENEWLINE2. What was the position of the staves? Were they attached to the ends or to the sides of the ark?NEWLINENEWLINE3. How could the ends of the staves be seen, and by whom and when - on the occasion of the dedication only or in later years?NEWLINENEWLINE4. Why has our author recorded this circumstance? As toNEWLINENEWLINE1. the balance of evidence is in favour of the ark having stood north and south, in a line, that is, with the wings of the cherubim. ForNEWLINENEWLINE(1) only thus apparently could the cherubim have \"covered the ark and the staves thereof.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) If it had been otherwise, the \"cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat,\" presuming that they were retained in the temple, would have had an unequal and one-sided position, for instead of being equally prominent, they would have stood, one with the back, the other with the face to the entrance and the holy place.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Had the ark stood east and west the projecting staves would surely have been in the high priest's way in the performance of his solemn functions (Leviticus 16:12-15). That they served to guide him to the mercy seat is of course mere conjecture, and as such of no weight.NEWLINENEWLINE2. As to the staves, Josephus states (Ant. 3:07. 5) that they ran along the sides of the ark, and this would appear to be the natural and proper arrangement. It follows hence again that they cannot have been more than eight or nine cubits long, inasmuch as they found a place between the bodies of the cherubim, which cannot have been more than nine cubits apart.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The explanation of the Rabbins is that the ends of the staves were not really seen, but that they projected into the curtain and so made two visible protrusions or prominences. But this view hardly satisfies the requirements of the text, and it assumes that the ark stood east and west, which we have found good reason to doubt. But even if this were so, it is doubtful whether the staves, so long as they remained in the rings, could be made to reach to the door of the oracle, unless indeed they were lengthened for the purpose. How then were they seen? The following considerations may assist us to answer this question.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The oracle, of course, in its normal state was in perfect darkness (ver. 12). Once a year, however, a gleam of light was admitted, when the curtain was drawn partially aside to permit of the high priest's entrance.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) When the curtain was drawn to one (probably the left) side, the light would fall, not on the ark, but on the ends of the staves projecting from the right or north end of the ark, which would thus be distinctly visible to the high priest. ButNEWLINENEWLINE(3) at this time the high priest was not alone in the holy place. It was not required that \"there should be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation,\" except when the high priest went in to make an atonement for the holy place (Leviticus 16:17). At an earlier stage of the service he would seem to have required assistance. According to the Mishna (Yoma), a priest held the basin of blood and stirred it to prevent coagulation, at the time of his first entry. MoreoverNEWLINENEWLINE(4) his extremely doubtful whether the high priest can have drawn aside the curtain himself. Whether he entered three or four times on that day, at his first entry his hands were certainly full. If he carried \"a censer full of burning coals of fire\".. \"and his hands (חָפְנָיו, both fits) full of sweet incense beaten small\" (ib. ver. 12), it is clear that some other person must have drawn aside the veil for him. It is to this person, I take it, the priest who was privileged to draw aside the curtain, and possibly to others standing near - certainly to the high priest - that the ends of the staves were visible. Nor would a reverent look directed towards these objects - made originally for the Levites to handle - involve unhallowed curiosity. And if this were so, it would help to explain (4) the mention of this circumstance by our author. If it were a fact that year by year a gleam of light fell upon the staves, and if priest after priest testified of what he had seen, up to the time of writing (\"unto this day;\" see below), we can readily understand why a circumstance of so much interest should be recorded. And we have not an adequate explanation of its mention here, if we are to understand that the staves were seen on the day of dedication, when of course they must have been visible, and never afterwards, or that the staves were partially drawn out of their rings in order to show that the ark was now at rest], and there they are unto this day. [Same expression 1 Kings 9:21; 1 Kings 12:19; 2 Kings 8:22. At the date of the publication of this book, the temple was of course destroyed (2 Kings 25:9), so that at that day the staves were not there. But the explanation is very simple. Our historian has copied the words he found in the MS. he was using.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses put there [Exodus 25:16; Exodus 40:20; Deuteronomy 10:5. This statement appears to be at variance with Hebrews 9:4, which mentions \"the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded,\" as in the ark, along with \"the tables of the covenant.\" And it is to be observed that, while our text excludes these relics from the ark (temp. Solomon), no other scripture save that just cited expressly includes them. In Exodus 16:34 and Numbers 17:25 (Heb. A.V., Numbers 17:10) they are commanded to be laid up \"before the testimony,\" words which no doubt may mean, as they were long interpreted to mean, \"before the tables of testimony in the ark\" - observe, the words are \"before the testimony,\" not \"before the ark\" - but which are now generally thought to import \"in front of the ark which con-rained the testimony.\" We know the book of the law was put \"at the side (מִצַּד) of the ark\" (Deuteronomy 31:26), and hence it is held by some that the golden pot, etc., occupied a similar position. It seems preferable, however, considering the distinct statement of St. Paul, or the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which, to say the least, embodies Jewish tradition, to adhere to the ancient interpretation that the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod were in the ark. And this in no wise conflicts with the statement of the text, for these treasures might well have been removed by the Philistines, whose first thought, we may be sure, would be to open their new acquisition. It is not improbable, indeed, that the object of the men of Bethshemesh in looking into the ark was to see whether these treasures were still there. For if the golden pot ever was in the ark, we can hardly suppose it would escape the rapacity of the Philistines, who would leave the two tables of stone as things of no value. Indeed, it is just possible that the trespass offering, the golden mice, etc., were designed as a return for the golden pot which had been removed. And the statement of the text, \"there was nothing,\" etc., almost implies that there had been something there at one time (see Alford on Hebrews 9:4). It seem probable, therefore, that the golden pot and Aaron's rod were originally deposited \"before the testimony\" in the ark; that they were removed during its captivity (1 Samuel 5:6.); and that the sacrilege was discovered at Bethshemesh (1 Samuel 6:19). This last mentioned episode explains how it came to be known that \"there was nothing,\" etc. It is hardly likely after that memorable visitation that Solomon could have opened the ark and taken out the two relics, as Rawlinson suggests. Nor have we any warrant for the view that the mercy seat, with the cherubs, was removed to make way for a new lid without them, and so the interior of the ark was disclosed to view (Stanley) ] at Horeb [See Exodus 3:1; Exodus 17:6; Exodus 33:6; 1 Kings 19:8.

It had rested upon the tabernacle on the day that it was dedicated (Exodus 40:34), had ac companied it in its journeys (ib. ver. 38), and had apparently been specially displayed at certain junctures in the history of Israel (Numbers 12:5, 10; Numbers 16:42; Deuteronomy 31:15). ]t was thus the acknowledged symbol of God's presence, and as such was a visible sign that He now accepted the temple, as He had formerly accepted the tabernacle, as His shrine and dwelling place. It is hardly correct to identify the cloud with the Shechinah of the Targums (Rawlinson), for it is noticeable that the Targums never render \"the cloud\" or \"the glory\" by \"the Shechinah.\" In fact, as regards the use of the word by Jewish writers, it would seem to be a periphrasis for God (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1241). We may see in the cloud, however, the seat of the Shechinah (Kitto, Cyclopedia, 3. p. 821) filled the house of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - So that the priests could not stand to rainwater because of the cloud [They were overpowered by the manifestation, precisely as Moses had been before (Exodus 40:35). It was at the moment when the singers and trumpeters, standing at the east end of the altar, began their service of praise - and the reappearance of the priests may well have been the signal for them to begin (2 Chronicles 5:13) - that \"the house was filled with a cloud.\" Possibly the priests were about to burn incense. Evidently ministrations of some sort were intended and were interrupted. The exact correspondence with Exodus 40:35 (cf. Ezekiel 44:4) is not to be overlooked. The idea obviously is that the Divine approval vouchsafed to the tabernacle was now in turn granted to the temple], for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord. [Is the \"glory of the Lord\" identical with the cloud, or is something additional intended by these words? It is certainly noticeable that what ver. 10 says of the cloud - that it \"filled the house\" - ver. 11 says of the glory. It is also true that there is no mention of any light or fire. And the \"darkness\" of ver. 12 might naturally seem to refer to the cloud, and therefore to exclude the idea of light. But surely the words כְּבוד יְיָ are to be interpreted here by their signification and use elsewhere, and we find \"the glory of the Lord elsewhere mentioned as something distinct from the cloud. We must remember that what by day was a pillar of cloud, by night was a pillar of fire (Exodus 13:21, 22). In Exodus 19:9, 16, the mention of the \"thick cloud\" is followed by the statement that \"Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire\" (ver. 18). Similarly, in Exodus 24, we are told that \"the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it (the glory?) six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire \" (vers. 16, 17). But perhaps the most decisive passage in this connexion is Exodus 40:34, where we are told that \"the cloud abode upon\" the tent of meeting, while \"the glory of the Lord filled the (interior of the) tabernacle.\" Compare Exodus 16:7, 10; Leviticus 9:6, 23; Numbers 14:10; Numbers 16:19, 42. It would appear, therefore, that \"the glory of the Lord\" was not the cloud, but, as the word almost seems to imply, a \"light from heaven above the brightness of the sun\" (Acts 26:13; cf. Revelation 1:14, 16). It is hardly necessary to add that the glory, though apparently resident in the cloud, was not always luminous; the cloud veiled it from the eyes of men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Then spake Solomon [in a transport of emotion at the sight. The cloud and the glory proved that his pious work was accepted. These blessed tokens assured him that \"the Lord was there\" (Ezekiel 48:35); that the incomprehensible Godhead had entered the earthly shrine he had prepared, and would dwell there], The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. [Heb. עֲרָפֶל, lit., darkness of clouds. When did God speak of dwelling in dark cloud? The reference, probably, is to Exodus 19:9; Exodus 20:21, Deuteronomy 4:11; Exodus 5:22 (note that, in the three last cited passages, this same word is used, and in the last two in connexion with cloud, which would appear to be a practically synonymous term), but especially to Leviticus 16:2, \"I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.\" Solomon had thus every warrant for connecting a theophany with the thick dark cloud. Cf. Psalm 18:11; Psalm 97:2. The words cannot refer to \"the holy of holies not lighted by windows\" (Wordsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I have surely built [Heb. to build, I have built] thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in forever. [The temple was primarily, as already remarked, a shrine for the ark, between the cherubim of the mercy seat of which God dwelt. This was a מָכֹון (from כוּן, statuit), a settled place. The tabernacle was but a poor and transitory abode, partaking of the frailty of the shepherd's tent (Isaiah 38:12). For עולָמִים (αἰῶνες), cf.

He now faced the congregation] and blessed [This word here, and in ver. 55, is used somewhat loosely. The blessing was in both cases addressed to God. The Hebrew king was not authorized to bless the people - that was the prerogative of the priests (Numbers 6:23; cf. Leviticus 9:22), and he is only said to bless here as felicitating, as wishing them a blessing. Dean Stanley ] \"Jewish Ch.,\" vol. 2. p 218) characteristically asserts that Solomon \"performed the highest sacerdotal act of solemn benediction.\" But the same word is used in ver. 66, of the people blessing the king. \"Did the people,\" as Wordsworth pertinently asks, \"also perform a priestly act?\" The word is elsewhere used of saluting. See note on ver. 66, and Gesen. s.v.] all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood); [Heb. were standing (עֹמֵד); \"stood\" conveys the idea that the congregation rose as Solomon spoke, whereas they were standing already in the temple courts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel [1 Kings 1:48], which spake with his mouth unto [or, concerning; אֵל after verbs of speaking has the force of de (Genesis 20:2; Jeremiah 40:16; Psalm 69:27).

The speech in the Chronicles looks as if it had been somewhat amplified, though it only completes the sense (Rawlinson)], but I chose David to be over my people Israel. [Cf. Psalm 78:70.

[2 Samuel 7:11, 12. The recurrence of \"the name\" of the Lord is to be noticed (see vers. 16, 17, 18, 29, 48, etc.) The name of God is the expression to man of Has nature, attributes, etc.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And the Lord hath performed [Same word as in 1 Kings 2:4.

We might translate \"established\" throughout] his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel [ch. 1:48], as the Lord promised [2 Samuel 7:12], and have built an house for the name of the Lord God of Israel [ib. ver. 13].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord [Hence its name, \"the ark of the covenant\" (Exodus 34:28; cf. Deuteronomy 9:11)] which he made with our forefathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt [vers. 9, 16]. SECTION II. - The Prayer. The prayer of dedication, properly so called, now begins. This solemn and beautiful composition was probably copied by our author from the \"Book of the Acts of Solomon\" (1 Kings 11:41), possibly from the \"Book of Nathan the prophet\" (2 Chronicles 9:29). It was evidently committed to writing beforehand, and would, no doubt, as a matter of course, be religiously preserved. The later criticism objects to its authenticity that the many references to the Pentateuch (compare ver. 12 with Exodus 19:9; ver. 31 with Exodus 22:11, Leviticus 5:1; ver. 33 with Leviticus 26:17, Deuteronomy 28:25; ver. 36 with Leviticus 26:25; ver. 50 with Leviticus 26:40, 42; ver. 51 with Deuteronomy 4:20, etc.) prove it to be of a later date. Ewald assigns it to the seventh century B.C.; but this is simply to beg the question of the date of the Pentateuch. It is obviously open to reply that these references only prove that the king was acquainted, as he was bound to be (Deuteronomy 17:18), with the words of the law. It divides itself into three parts. The first (vers. 22-30) is general; the second (vers. 31-53) consists of seven special petitions; the last (vers. 50-53) consists of a general conclusion and appeal to God's covenant mercy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And Solomon stood [i.e., took his stand (LXX. ἀνέστη). Not \"was standing.\" It was but for a moment, however, for we find him presently kneeling (ver. 54; 2 Chronicles 6:13). The latter passage informs us that he both stood and knelt upon a \"brazen scaffold,\" three cubits high] before the altar of the Lord [i.e., the brazen altar of sacrifice. The platform or scaffold was \"set in the midst of the court\" (2 Chronicles l.c.) All these rites took place in the open air. The king bad no place within the edifice] in the presence [the word is not to be pressed to mean \"facing the people.\" It is hardly likely he would pray towards the people - he was their προφήτης, i.e., he spoke for them to God - or turn his back on the sacred Presence just manifested], and spread forth his hands towards heaven: [one attitude of earnest prayer thoughout the East, as may be seen at the present day amongst the Mohammedans. (See Lane's \"Modern Egyptians,\" ch. 3, \"Religion and Laws.\") So completely was this posture identified with supplication that to \"lift up the hands\" came to be a synonym for prayer (Exodus 9:29, 33; Psalm 44:20; Psalm 143:6; Isaiah 1:15; Isaiah 65:2.) ]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee [Similar words are found in Exodus 15:11; Psalm 86:8, etc. They do not at all imply the existence of other gods, but are explained by other passages (e.g., ver. 60; Deuteronomy 4:39, \"the Lord He is God and none else;\" 2 Samuel 7:22; 2 Samuel 22:32) as meaning that the God of Israel stands alone, and alone is God. It would be strange, indeed, if the people whose great peculium was the unity of the Godhead (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 42:8) recognized other deities. Observe: Solomon begins his prayer with an act of praise; with a recognition at once grateful and graceful of God's past mercies (cf. Psalm 65:1, 2; Philippians 4:6). Exandit Dominus invocantem, quem laudantem vidit\" (Augustine) ], in heaven above, or on earth beneath [Joshua 2:11], who keepest covenant and mercy [same words in Deuteronomy 7:9] with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart.

The Jewish belief respecting the seven heavens (see Wetstein on 2 Corinthians 12:2; Stanley, \"Corinthians,\" l.c.) is of much later date, and a reference to it, or to the belief of some Rabbins in two heavens (after Deuteronomy 10:14), is altogether out of the question. The \"heaven of heavens\" = \"all the spaces of heaven, however vast and infinite\" (Gesen., cf. Psalm 148:4).

Ezekiel 48:35, and vers. 18. 19, 20, etc. When had God said this? Never perhaps, in so many words. Keil says the reference is to 2 Samuel 7:13 implicite (\"He shall build an house for my name\"), while Rawlinson thinks the \"reference is not to any single text, but to the many passages in Deuteronomy where God speaks of a place which He will choose to 'set his name' there (Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 18, etc.; Deuteronomy 14:23; 15:20; 16:2, etc.) \" But it is very probable that a revelation was made to David respecting the sanctuary, the terms of which are not preserved to us. This is almost implied by Psalm 78:68; Psalm 132:10; 1 Chronicles 22:1 - passages which prove that David claimed to have Divine sanction for placing the temple on \"Mount Zion.\" Psalm 132, is unmistakeably Davidic, and embodies some features of the message of God (e.g., the condition, ver. 12) not preserved in 2 Samuel 7.]: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward [Marg. in, but Heb. אֵל. supports the A.V. rendering.

The chronicler here, as elsewhere, simplifies the meaning by reading \"from heaven,\" מִן־הַשּׁ] thy dwelling place [Here, and in vers. 39, 43, and 49, heaven is described as the true dwelling place of Deity. Confidently as Solomon believes that he has built a habitation for the Lord, he never dreams that the \"Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands\" (Acts 7:48; Acts 17:4) ]: and when thou hearest, forgive. [There is possibly a play of words here - שָׁמַיִם שָׁמַעְתָּ]. With the next verse the special or particular supplications begin. Like those of the Lord's prayer, they are seven in number, and no doubt for the same reason, viz., because seven was the number of covenant, the number which expressed the relationship between the Lord and His people (\"die Signatur der Verbindung Gottes und der Welt\" - Bahr, Symbolik, 1:187 sqq.) In fact, to the Jew the number \"seven\" was something like the sign of the cross to a large portion of Catholic Christendom, for it spoke to him of God's covenant of mercy and peace. And the first of the seven concerns oaths. The king implores the covenant-keeping God to watch over the covenants of words made in the now consecrated sanctuary, and to protect their sanctity by punishing the false swearer. There were cases in which the Mosaic law provided that an oath should be administered to suspected persons (Exodus 22:11; Leviticus 5:1, 4, etc.) And there were other cases in which men of their own accord, for \"an end of all strife,\" would make oath. Now every oath, whatever its form (Matthew 23:16-22), is in reality an affirmation\" by the God of truth\" (Isaiah 65:16); it is an appeal to the knowledge and power and justice of the Most High (Leviticus 19:12; Deuteronomy 6:13; Deuteronomy 10:20; Isaiah 48:1; Jeremiah 12:16; Jeremiah 44:26). A false oath, consequently, dishonoured the Divine name, and polluted the sanctuary dedicated to that name, and if it went unpunished, contradicted the principles and provisions of the dispensation Of temporal punishments, and so encouraged falsehood and impiety. God is here entreated, consequently, to take cognizance of the oaths sworn before His altar (ver. 31), and to be a swift witness against the false swearers (Malachi 3:5). It is, perhaps, because of the direct dishonour which perjury offers to the Divine name that, as Bahr suggests, this prayer stands first among the seven, thus corresponding to the \"Hallowed be Thy name\" in the Lord's prayer, and to the third among the ten commandments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - If any man trespass [The force of the Hebrew (which begins somewhat abruptly) אֵת אֲשֶׁר (LXX. ὅσα α}ν ἁμάρτη) is probably, As for that which, or in all cases in which, i.e., when (as Ewald, 333 a).

Psalm 1:5; Exodus 24:6-8; cf. 20:24. The altar which afforded shelter to the manslayer, in the same way lent sanctity to the oath. The practice of swearing by the altar (Matthew 23:18) is of later date.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Then hear thou in heaven [Heb. and thou, thou wilt hear the heavens. The same expression, תּשְׁמַע הַשָּׁמַיִם, is found in vers. 34, 36, 39. See Ewald, 300 a. Keil sees in it the adverbial use of the accusative.

To be separated from the commonwealth, the rites and the blessings of Israel, was one of the greatest calamities which could befal a Jew (Deuteronomy 4:27, 28; Leviticus 26:33; Psalm 137.), and as such Solomon gives it a prominent place in his prayer. The connexion, how. ever which some have imagined to exist between this prayer and the preceding, viz., that that referred to internal, this to external dangers, is too artificial to have found a place in Solomon's thoughts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy [cf. Leviticus 26:7, 17; Deuteronomy 28:25. There is a constant reference to these two chapters throughout this prayer, or, if no direct reference to them, there are unmistakeable reminiscences of them], because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess [or praise. Psalm 54:8 Hebr. [Psalm 54:7]; Psalms 106:47; 122:4] thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house. [The marg. towards is a mistaken attempt at avoiding the difficulty which lies on the surface of the text, viz., that persons in a foreign land could not pray in the temple. But the king obviously is speaking here, not of those taken captive, but of the nation at large (\"thy people Israel\") by its representatives (cf. Joel 2:17), supplicating after its defeat. The idea of captives does not come in until the next verse. Under the term house the courts are obviously included (Acts 2:46; Luke 18:10). Into the edifice the priests alone were admitted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them [i.e., the captives of Israel, those carried off by the enemy. There is no thought here of the captivity of the nation - that is referred to in vers. 46-50 - as the prayers to be offered in the temple prove. This petition is in exact accordance with the promises and threatenings of the law, for the former of which see Leviticus 26:40-44; Deuteronomy 30:1-5; for the latter, Leviticus 26:33; Deuteronomy 4:27; Deuteronomy 28:64 sqq.] again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. The third petition concerns the plague of drought. Just as rain, in the thirsty and sunburnt East, has ever been accounted one of the best gifts of God (Leviticus 26:4; Deuteronomy 11:11; Job 5:10, and passim; Psalm 68:9; Psalm 147:8; Acts 14:17), so was drought denounced as one of His severest scourges (Leviticus 26:19; Deuteronomy 11:17; Deuteronomy 28:23, 24, etc.) This petition finds an illustration in the public supplications which are still offered in the East, and by men of all creeds, for rain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place [toward, because the inhabitants of the land everywhere would direct their prayers toward the holy oracle in Jerusalem (Psalm 28:2) ], and confess [praise] thy name, and turn from their sin, when [or because, כִּי] thou afflictest them.

The fourth petition refers to the various plagues mentioned in the law (Leviticus 26; Deuteronomy 28.), as the punishment of apostasy or infidelity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - If there be in the land famine [Heb. Famine should there be, etc. The word is emphatic by position. Famine is denounced, Leviticus 26:20, 26; Deuteronomy 28:33], if there be pestilence [Leviticus 26:25; Jeremiah 14:12; Jeremiah 24:10; Amos 4:10; Ezekiel 6:12, etc.], blasting [same word Genesis 41:6; Amos 4:9; Deuteronomy 28:22], mildew [lit. paleness, χλωρότης, Deuteronomy l.c.], locust, or if there be caterpillar [It is uncertain whether חָסִיל, lit., devourer, here rendered \"caterpillar,\" is not an adjective and an appellation of the locust = devouring locust. Deuteronomy 28:38 (יַאֲסְלֶנוּ חָאַרְבֶּה \"the locust shall consume it\") certainly favours this view. But the Chronicles and the Verss. distinguish it here (by the introduction of \"and\" between the two words) as a separate plague. It is also similarly distinguished, Joel 1:4; Psalm 78:46. Gesen. considers it to be a species of locust]; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities [Heb. his gates, but \"the land of his gates\" hardly yields sense. It is noteworthy that the LXX. (with most of the Verss.) reads ἐν μιᾷ τῶν πόλεων αὐτοῦ. Thenius, consequently, to bring the Hebrew text into harmony, would substitute באחת עיריו for בארץ שעריו. Another suggested emendation is בארץ בשעריו, \"in the land, even in their gates.\" But it is doubtful whether any alteration is really required. \"The land of their gates\" (cf. \"land of their captivity,\" 2 Chronicles 6:37; Jeremiah 30:10, etc.) may perhaps be interpreted the land where their gates (i.e., fortified cities) are. The marg. \"Jurisdiction\" - the gate being the place of judgment (Ruth 4:11; Proverbs 22:22; 2 Samuel 15:2) - is altogether out of the question]; whatsoever plague, whatsoever [Heb. every plague, etc.] sickness there be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhat prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - What prayer and supplication soever [There is here a studied reference to the preceding words. Lit., every prayer, etc. We might render in ver. 37, \"Whatsoever the plague,\" etc., and here, \"Whatsoever the prayer,\" etc.] be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart [Here again there is an unmistakeable reference to the \"plague\" (same word) of ver. 37. The plague of the heart is the inner smart of the conscience corresponding with and perhaps more painful than the smiting of the person. The meaning obviously is that the prayers will vary. according to the various mental and physical sufferings of men], and spread forth his hands [see on ver. 22] toward this house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) [Jeremiah 17:10.

[Solomon anticipates that a godly fear will be the result of forgiveness and restoration. We find the same thought in Psalm 130:4. The mercy and goodness of God should lead to repentance, but unhappily it not unseldom fails to do so.] The fifth petition contemplates the prayers which foreigners, attracted by the fame of Jerusalem, of its religion and sanctuary could offer towards the house. The Gentiles who should visit Jerusalem would assuredly, with their polytheistic ideas and their belief in local or tribal deities, invoke the aid and blessing of the mighty God of Jacob. This mention of aliens from the commonwealth of Israel in the prayer of dedication, especially when viewed in the light of the exclusiveness and bigotry which characterized the Jews of later days, is especially to be noticed. As Rawlinson (in loco) observes, \"Nothing is more remarkable in the Mosaic law than its liberality with regard to strangers.\" He then quotes Exodus 22:21; Leviticus 25:35; Deuteronomy 10:19; Deuteronomy 31:12; Numbers 15:14-16; and adds: \"It is quite in the spirit of these enactments that Solomon, having first prayed God on behalf of his fellow countrymen, should next go on to intercede for the strangers,\" etc. The intercourse of the Hebrews at this period with foreign nations, and the influence they exercised on the Jewish thought and manners (see Stanley, \"Jewish Ch.\" 2. Leer. 26.), are also to be remembered. These new relations with the stranger would no doubt have widened Solomon's views.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; [Solomon takes it for granted that such will come, and not without good reason, for the house was \"exceeding magnifical\" and destined to be \"of fame and glory throughout all countries\" (1 Chronicles 22:5). And we can hardly doubt that in the visit of the Queen of Sheba we are to see one fulfilment of this anticipation. (Note the expression of ch. 10:1 \"concerning the name of the Lord.\") One who blessed God, as she did (ver. 9), would certainly pray towards the house. In the time of the second temple there were several instances of strangers (e.g., Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Philadelphus, and Seleucus; see Keil in loc.) worshipping the God of Jacob in Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - (For they shall hear of thy great name [Cf. Joshua 7:9; Psalm 76:1; Psalm 99:3], and of thy strong hand [cf. Exodus 6:6; Exodus 13:9; Deuteronomy 9:26, 29; cf. 7:19. They had heard at a much earlier date (Exodus 15:14; Exodus 18:1; Joshua 5:1). The reference is not so much to the marvels of the Exodus - that was long past - as to the wondrous works which Solomon assumes will hereafter be wrought], and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Hear thou in heaven thy dwell-lug place, and do according to an that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name [It is interesting to notice this foreshadowing of the inclusion of the Gentiles in the one fold. The same thought is found in some of the Psalms and in Isaiah, as St. Paul witnesses (Romans 15:9 sqq.) Cf. Psalm 22:27; Psalm 72:11; Psalm 86:9; Psalm 98:3; Psalm 102:15; Psalm 117:1; Isaiah 49:6; Isaiah 52:10] to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name. [Heb. that thy name is called (or, has been called, נִקְרָא. LXX. ἐπικέκληται) upon this house, i.e., that God has taken this house for His habitation: that He dwells there, works, hears, answers there. Same expression, Jeremiah 7:10, 11, 14; Jeremiah 25:29; Deuteronomy 28:10; Isaiah 4:1. In Numbers 6:27 we have, \"they shall put my name upon the children of Israel.\" In Deuteronomy 12:5, and Deuteronomy 16:6 (cf. 1 Kings 11:36), we read of the place God has \"chosen to put his name there.\" So far the royal suppliant has spoken of prayers offered in or at the temple. He now mentions two cases where supplications will be offered by penitents far distant from the holy city or even from the Holy Land. And first, he speaks of the armies of Israel on a campaign.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever [Heb. in the way which] thou shalt send them [These words clearly imply that the war, whether defensive or offensive (i.e., for the chastisement of other nations), is one which had God's sanction, and indeed was waged by His appointment], and shall pray unto the Lord toward [Heb. in the way of. Same expression as above. The repetition is significant. \"They have gone in God's way. They may therefore look the way of God's house for help.\" Executing God's commission, they might justly expect His blessing] the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. [Heb. do their judgments, i.e., secure them justice, defend the right. Same words, Deuteronomy 10:18; cf. Psalm 9:5, Heb.] The last petition - the second of those which speak of prayers addressed towards the temple, or the Holy Presence which dwelt there, from a foreign land - contemplates as possible the captivity of the Hebrew nation. It has hence been too readily inferred that this portion of the prayer, at least, if not the preceding petition also, has been interpolated by a post-captivity writer. But there is really no solid reason for doubting its genuineness. Not only is it the seventh petition (see on ver. 31), but the captivity of Israel had been denounced as the punishment of persistent disobedience long before by Moses, and in the chapters to which such constant reference is made (Leviticus 26:33, 44; Deuteronomy 28:25, 36, 64; cf. 4:27) - a fact which is in itself an indirect proof of genuineness, as showing that this petition is of a piece with the rest of the prayer. And when to this we add that the carrying of a conquered and refractory race into captivity was an established custom of the East, we shall be inclined to agree with Bahr, that \"it would have been more remarkable if Solomon had not mentioned it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sinneth not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy [Heb. give them before an enemy], so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, fax or near;NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - Yet if they shall bethink themselves [Heb. as marg., bring back to their heart. Same phrase, Deuteronomy 4:39; Deuteronomy 30:1. The latter passage, it should be noticed, treats of the captivity, so that Solomon, consciously or unconsciously, employs some of the very words used by Moses in contemplating this contingency. These repeated coincidences lead to the belief that the prayer was based upon and compiled from the Pentateuch] in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have Committed wickedness. [This verse is full of paronomasia, שבו נשבו השיבו, etc. Words almost identical with this confession were used (Daniel 9:5; Psalm 106:6) by the Jews in their captivity at Babylon, from which it has been concluded that this part of the prayer must belong to the time of the captivity. But surely it is, to say the least, just as likely that the Jews, when the captivity of which Solomon spoke befel them, borrowed the phrase in which their great king by anticipation expressed their penitence. Seeing in the captivity a fulfilment of his prediction, they would naturally see in this formula, which no doubt had been preserved in the writings of the prophets, a confession specially appropriate to their case, and indeed provided for their use.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - And so return unto thee with all their heart [almost the words of Deuteronomy 30. ver. 2, as those in ver. 47 are of ver. 1], and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, Which led them away captive [observe the paronomasia - שבו is here used in two senses], and pray unto thee toward [Heb. the way of] their land [see Daniel 6:10] which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name.

[For the fulfilment of this prayer, see Ezra 1:3, 7; Ezra 6:13; Nehemiah 2:6. Compare Psalm 106:46.] In the three following verses we have a sort of general conclusion to the dedication prayer. It is hardly correct to say that these last words apply to all the preceding petitions - the plea \"they are thy people\" manifestly cannot apply in the case of vers. 41-43. On the other hand, as little are they to be limited to the persons last mentioned in vers. 46-50, though it is highly probable they were suggested by the thought of the captives. They are manifestly in close connection with the preceding verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - For they be thy people [a citation or reminiscence of Deuteronomy 4:10], and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt [cf. vers. 21, 53. There is a constant recurrence throughout the Old Testament to this great deliverance, and with good reason, for it was the real birthday of the nation, and was also a pledge of future help and favour. God who had \"wrought such great things for them in Egypt \"could not well forsake them. Solomon's constant plea is that they are the elect and covenant race] from the midst of the furnace of iron [i.e., a furnace for iron, heated and fierce as for smelting. Same phrase, Deuteronomy 4:20].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - That thine eyes may be open [cf. ver. 29] unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel [of. vers. 28, 30], to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - For thou didst separate them from [Leviticus 20:24, 26; cf. Exodus 19:5, 6] among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance [same expression, Deuteronomy 4:20; Deuteronomy 9:26, 29. This is no idle repetition of ver. 51. The idea of that verse is deliverance, of this election. Cf. Numbers 16:9; Numbers 8:14], as thou spakest by the hand [see note on ch. 2:25] of Moses thy servant [Exodus 19:5, 6; Deuteronomy 9:26, 29; Deuteronomy 14:2], when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God. In Chronicles (ch. 6:41, 42) the prayer ends somewhat differently. \"Now therefore arise, O Lord God,\" etc. - words which are found in substance in Psalm 132:8-10. These two verses look like an addition, and were probably inserted by the chronicler to form a connecting link with 1 Kings 7:1-3 (Bahr). The LXX. has an extremely curious addition, said to be taken from the \"Book of the Song.\" Stanley sees in its very abruptness and obscurity an evidence of its genuineness (\"Jewish Ch.\" 2:218). SECTION III. - The Concluding Blessing. The service of dedication concludes, as it commenced, with a benediction (ver. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before [see note on ver. 22] the altar of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees [the first mention of this posture in the sacred history (Stanley). The Jews usually stood in prayer (Luke 18:11, 13) ] with [Heb. and] his hands spread up to heaven.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - And he stood [this does not necessarily imply that he drew nearer to the congregation, as Keil], and blessed [cf. 2 Samuel 6:18, and see note on ver. 14. The words of blessing, which are presently given (vers. 56-61), prove that he did not assume priestly functions and put any blessing upon the people, Numbers 6:27] all the congregation of Israel with a loud [Heb. great] voice, saying,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised [a distinct reference to Deuteronomy 12:9, 10 (cf. 3:20), where we read that when the Lord should have given rest to Israel, then a place for sacrifice, etc., should be appointed (ver. 11). That place is now dedicated, and the king sees in this circumstance a proof that the rest is now at last fully attained. The permanent sanctuary is a pledge of settlement in the land. The rest hitherto enjoyed (Joshua 21:44) had been but partial. Only under Solomon were the Philistines brought into complete subjection (1 Kings 9:16), and hitherto the ark had dwelt in curtains]; there hath not failed [Heb. fallen; cf. 1 Samuel 3:19] one word [a clear reference to Joshua 21:45, as the preceding words are to ver. 44] of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand [cf. ver. 53] of Moses his servant [viz. in Leviticus 26:3-13, and in Deuteronomy 28:1-14, i.e., in the chapters which are the sources of this prayer, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - The Lord our God be With us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us. [Solomon insensibly glides again into prayer; here for the presence of God, in ver. 59 for His help. There is probably a reference to Deuteronomy 31:6, 8; Joshua 1:5, where, however, \"forsake\" is represented by a different word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 58. - That he may incline our hearts unto him [Psalm 119:26; Psalm 141:4], to walk in an his ways [ver. 25; 1 Kings 2:4. The condition on which God's blessing was insured was at this time printed on Solomon's mind], and to keep his commandments, and his satutes, and his Judgments [see note on 1 Kings 2:3, to which ver. there is not improbably a reference], which he commanded our fathers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 59. - And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of [Heb. to do the judgment of] his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require [Heb. the thing of a day in his day. Same phrase Exodus 5:18; Exodus 16:4]:NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 60. - That an the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God, and that there is none else. [See ver. 22. We have here a recurrence to the thought of ver. 43, which was evidently prominent in Solomon's mind. He hopes the house now dedicated will be fraught with blessing for the world, and that the Gentiles will come to its light. Cf. Isaiah 2:2, 3.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 61. - Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God [An instructive commentary on these words is found in 1 Kings 11:4, where it is said of this Solomon, \"His heart was not perfect,\" etc. - same words. Similarly, ib. vers. 3, 9 are a comment on the prayer of ver. 58. Having preached to others, he himself became a castaway], to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, us at this day [That day the nation proved its piety by the dedication of the house. At the close of this prayer (omitted in Chronicles), according to 2 Chronicles 7:1, \"fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the house,\" but Bahr rejects these words as an interpolation. He maintains, indeed, that the chronicler contradicts himself, for we can hardly think that the glory which we are told (1 Kings 5:14) had already filled the house, left it and then returned. It is certainly suspicious, and a much stronger argument against the words in question, that no mention of the fire is made by our author, for, brief as this history is, it is difficult to believe that so signal an interposition could have remained unnoticed, if it really occurred. SECTION IV. - The Festal Sacrifices. The ceremonial of dedication was followed, as would naturally be the case, by sacrifices on a scale of unusual grandeur. Apart from their religious use and significance, the sacrifices testified to the devotion of the giver who on this of all days must not appear before the Lord empty, and they also afforded materials for the great and prolonged feast by which this auspicious event in the history of Israel must be commemorated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 62. - And the king, and an Israel with him [Another indication (see on ver. 2) that practically the whole Israelitish nation (i.e., its males) assembled to witness this great function (ver. 65. But see on 1 Kings 16:17). The words also prove that the sacrifices mentioned presently were offered by the people as well as by the king], offered sacrifice before the Lord. [See note on 1 Kings 9:25 ]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:63VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 63. - And Solomon offered a sacrifice [Solomon is mentioned as chief donor, and as the executive. But others shared in the gift] of peace offerings [Leviticus 7:11 sqq. This was especially the sacrifice of praise - it is called \"the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings,\" ib. vers. 13, 15. See Bahr, Symb. 2:368 sqq. In the peace offering, the fat was burnt on the altar, but the flesh was eaten (ver. 15; cf. Deuteronomy 12:7), so that this form of offering was, in every way, adapted to a festival. The idea that \"ox after ox, to the number of 22,000, and sheep after sheep, to the number of 120,000, were consumed,\" sc. by fire (Stanley), is expressly excluded], which he offered unto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. [it is very possible that these numbers have been altered in course of transcription, as is the case with numbers elsewhere, but there is no ground for suspecting exaggeration or mistake. For, in the first place, the Chronicles and all the Versions agree with the text, and, secondly, the numbers, compared with what we know of the sacrifices offered on other occasions, are not unduly large, nor were they such that (as has been alleged) it would be impossible to offer them within the time specified. If, at an ordinary Passover a quarter of a million of lambs could be sacrificed within the space of two or three hours (Jos., Bell. Jud. 6:09.8), there can obviously have been \"no difficulty in sacrificing 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep on each of the seven days of the festival\" (Keil). (But were not the sacrifices spread over fourteen days? ver. 65.) And it is to be rememberedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that \"profusion was a usual feature of the sacrifices of antiquity Sacrifices of a thousand oxen (χιλιόμβαι) were not infrequent. According to an Arabian historian (Koto beddyn), the Caliph Moktader sacrificed during his pilgrimage to Mecca... 40,000 camels and cows and 50,000 sheep. Tavernier speaks of 100,000 victims as offered by the King of Tonquin\" (Rawlinson, Stanley); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the context insists on the ex traordinary number of victims. They were so numerous, we are told, that the brazen altar was quite inadequate to receive them (ver. 64). It has been already pointed out (note on ver. 62) that the people joined the king in the sacrifices. Indeed it is against not only ver. 62, but vers. 63, 65, to suppose that all the victims were offered by Solomon alone (Ewald, Stanley). If these numbers, therefore, include those offered by the people, we can the more readily understand them. For, by the lowest computation, there could hardly be less than 100,000 heads of houses present at the feast (Bahr, Keil), and if the numbers of David's census (2 Samuel 24:9) may be trusted, there may very well have been four or five times that number, and on such an occasion as that, an occasion altogether without precedent, every Israelite would doubtless offer his sacrifice of thanksgiving - the more so as a large number of victims would be required for the purposes of the subsequent feast. And as to the impossibility of the priests offering so prodigious a number within the specified time (Thenius, al.), we have only to rememberNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that if there were 38,000 Levites (men over thirty years of age) in the time of David (1 Chronicles 23:3), or any thing like that number, there must have been at the very least at this period two or three thousand priests (Keil), and we can hardly think that at the dedication of so glorious a temple, in which they were so profoundly interested, many of them would be absent from Jerusalem. But if there were only one thousand present, that number would have been amply sufficient to perform all the priestly functions. For it was no necessary, part of the priests' office either to slay the victim, or to prepare it for sacrifice - that any Israelite might do (Leviticus 1:5, 6, 11; Leviticus 3:2, 8, etc.); the duty of the priest was strictly limited to \"sprinkling the blood round about upon the altar\" (Leviticus 3:2, 8; cf. 1:5), and burning the fat, the kidneys, etc., upon the altar (Leviticus 3:5). It is clear, consequently, that there is no difficulty whatsoever as to the manual acts required of the priests. It only remains to notice one other objection, viz., that the people could not possibly have eaten all the flesh of these peace offerings. But here again the answer is conclusive, viz.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that it was not necessary that all should be eaten, for the law expressly provided that if any of the flesh remained over until the third day, it should be burnt with fire (Leviticus 7:15; Leviticus 19:6), andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) no one can say what the number of people may not have been (see below on ver. 65), andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the sacrifices were spread over fourteen days.] So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:64VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 64. - The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court [i.e., the entire area of the court of the priests (1 Kings 6:36). Ewald (287 g) translates \"the inner court.\" The whole space may have been regarded as \"one huge altar\" (Rawlinson), or temporary altars may have been erected all over the area. As already observed, this fact alone points to an enormous number of victims] that was before the house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings [Heb. the burnt offerings, i.e., either the usual daily burnt offerings (Numbers 28:3), or more probably, those appropriate to such a special function (Numbers 29:13 sqq.; cf. 1 Kings 3:4) ], and meat offerings [Heb. the meat offering. Both this and the preceding word (הָעֹלָה) are singular (generic) in the original], and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the Lord [i.e., house of the Lord] was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings [and yet it was 20 cubits (30 feet) square, and so would offer a surface of 100 (Keil 144) square yards].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings8:65VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 65. - And at that time Solomon held a feast [the necessary sequel to such number of peace offerings (cf. 1 Kings 3:15). All the flesh that could be, must be eaten (Leviticus 19:5, 6) ], and all Israel with him, a great congregation [see note on ver. 64. \"All Israel\" would hardly be an exaggeration], from the entering in of Hamath [the northern boundary of Palestine (Numbers 34:8; cf. 13:31; Joshua 13:5; Judges 3:3; Ezekiel 47:16; Stanley, S. and P. p. 407; Dict.

See Stanley, S. and P. pp. 14, 505, 506] of Egypt [i.e., the southern limit of the Holy Land. See Numbers 34:5; Joshua 15:4, 47; 2 Kings 24:7; Genesis 15:18, where the word is נָהָר refers to the Nile. The Wady el Arish must be intended (Dict. Bib. vol. 3. p. 1046, 1047, and Gesen., Thesaurus, vol. 2. p. 872, Porter, p. 267) ], before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days [The two periods are thus distinguished, because they were properly distinct, the first being the feast of dedication, the second the feast of tabernacles.

The first impression is that the eighth day of the period of fourteen days is meant, but the context, to say nothing of the Chronicles, contradicts this. The feast of dedication began on the eighth day of the month Ethanim (ver. 2), and lasted until the fourteenth. The feast of tabernacles began on the fifteenth and lasted till the twenty-first. On the evening of the twenty-second, the \"day of restraint\" (Leviticus 23:36 marg.), he dismissed the people, who would depart to their homes next morning]: and they blessed [i.e., felicitated, saluted (on taking leave). Cf. Proverbs 27:14; 2 Kings 4:29; 1 Samuel 25:6, 14. Marg. thanked. See note on ver. 14] the king, and went unto their tents [i.e., homes - an archaic expression, dating from the times of the desert wanderings. Joshua 22:4; Judges 7:8; 2 Samuel 20:1; 1 Kings 12:16] joyful and glad of heart for an the goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant [the real founder of the temple. Solomon had but carried out his ideas and had entered into his labours], and for Israel his people.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Kgs.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And it came to pass when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord, and the king's house [1 Kings 7:1], and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do [By \"desire\" we are not to understand \"pleasure buildings\" (cf. vers. 10, 19). The chronicler gives the true meaning: \"all that came into Solomon's heart.\" It is, however, somewhat doubtful what works are comprehended under this term. 2 Chronicles 7:11 limits it to the two great erections already described - \"all that came into his heart to make in the house of the Lord and in his own house.\" But it is by no means certain that our author intended the word to be thus restricted; it is quite possible, e.g., that some of the buildings mentioned below (vers. 15-19) are to be included. But another question of much greater importance presents itself here. In the Divine communication of vers. 3-9 there is constant and unmistakeable reference to the prayer of dedication (see especially ver. 3); in fact, this message is the answer to that prayer. It has been held, consequently, that the answer must have followed, if not immediately, yet soon after the petitions were uttered; if so, the dedication must clearly have taken place, not on the completion of the temple (1 Kings 6:38), but on the completion of the palace, etc.; in other words, the temple must have been finished fully thirteen years before it was consecrated and occupied. Rawlinson suggests that the delay was perhaps occasioned by the circumstance that the furniture of the temple was not till then ready; but 1 Kings 6:38, Hebrews, seems to state distinctly that all the vessels and appointments of the sanctuary were finished at the date there given. Reasons have been given elsewhere (see note on 1 Kings 8:1) in support of the position that the dedication possibly have been delayed for so long a period, especially after the strenuous efforts which had been made to hurry on the undertaking. Nor does the text, when carefully examined, really require this hypothesis; indeed, it suggests some reasons for thinking that a considerable period must have intervened between the prayer and the response. For the tone of this response is unmistakeably foreboding, if not minatory. Vers. 6-9 contain a stern warning. But there was nothing, so far as we know, in the attitude of Solomon or of Israel at the time of the dedication to call for any such denunciation. At that time, as the prayer surely proves, Solomon's heart was perfect with the Lord his God. But the response has unmistakeably the appearance of having been elicited by signs of defection. The wide difference, consequently, between the spirit of the prayer and the tone of the answer suggests that some time must have elapsed between them, and so far supports the view that the dedication was not delayed until the palace, etc., was completed. And it is also to be remembered that the prayer of dedication had not been without acknowledgment at the time. The excellent glory which filled and took possession of the house was itself a significant and sufficient response. No voice or vision could have said more plainly, \"I have heard thy prayer, I have hallowed this house.\" But when, some thirteen years later - about the very time, that is, when he was at the height of his prosperity, and when, owing to the completion of his undertakings, we might fear lest his heart should be lifted up with pride - when Solomon and his court began to decline in piety and to go after other gods, then this merciful message opportunely refers him to the prayer which he was in danger of forgetting, and warns him of the consequences of the apostasy to which he was tending.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time [see on 1 Kings 6:11, and 1 Kings 11:9; Solomon had received a message during the building of the temple], as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon [i.e., in a dream (1 Kings 3:5) ].NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the Lord said unto him [This message is given at greater length in 2 Chronicles 7:12-22. Vers. 13, 14, e.g., contain a reference to that part of the prayer which related to drought and rain], I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication [These two words are found similarly united in Solomon's prayer, vers. 38, 45, 54], that thou hast made [Heb. supplicated] before me; I have hallowed this house which thou hast built [sc. by the manifestation described 1 Kings 8:11. Cf. Exodus 29:43: \"the tabernacle shall be sanctified\" (same word) \"by my glory.\" In 2 Chronicles we read, \"I have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice,\" where, however, it is worth considering whether instead of the somewhat singular בית זבח the original text may not have been בית זבל, as in 1 Kings 8:13] to put my name there [1 Kings 8:29; cf. vers. 16, 17, 18, 19; also Deuteronomy 12:11; Luke 11:12] forever [1 Kings 8:13. As Solomon offered it, so God accepted it, in perpetuity. That the house was subsequently \"left desolate\" and destroyed (2 Kings 25:9) was because of the national apostasy (vers. 8, 9) ], and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. [In 1 Kings 8:29 Solomon asked that God's \"eyes may be open... towards the house.\" The answer is that not only His eyes shall be open, but eyes and heart shall be there [Ephesians 3:20; see Homiletics on 1 Kings 3:5); - the eye to watch, the heart to cherish it.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And [Heb.

David was not perfect, as our author tells us elsewhere (1 Kings 15:5; cf. 1 Kings 1:6; 2 Samuel 24:10). His integrity consisted in his unvarying loyalty to the true God. Even when overcome by that fierce temptation (2 Samuel 11.) he never faltered in his allegiance to the truth. There was no coquetting with idolatrous practices; cf. Psalm 18:20-24], to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments [the echo of David's last words, 1 Kings 2:3, 4.

Our translators were probably influenced by 2 Chronicles 7:21, the text of which is אֲשֶׁר הָיהָ עֶלְיון which would seem to be an emendation, designed to clear up the difficulty rather than an accidental variation of the text. But here the literal rendering is probably the truer, the meaning being \"this house shall be conspicuous, as an example\" - so the Vulg. domus haec erit in exemplum. The LXX. accords with the Hebrew text, ὁ οῖκος οῦτος ἔσται ὁ ὐψηλὸς, but the Syriac and Arabic read, \"this house shall be destroyed.\" Keil sees in the words an allusion implicite to Deuteronomy 26:19, and Deuteronomy 28:1, where God promises to make Israel עֶלְיון, and says \"the blessing will be turned into a curse.\" The temple should indeed be \"high,\" should be what Israel would have been, but it shall be as a warning, etc.; but this connexion is somewhat far fetched and artificial. Thenius would read for, עִיִּין עֶלְיון. \"ruins,\" after Micah 3:12; Jeremiah 26:18; Psalm 79:1; but it is hardly right to resort to conjectures, unsupported by a single version or MS., so long as any sufficient meaning can be extracted from the words as they stand, and no one can deny that \"high\" may surely signify \"conspicuous.\" Cf. Matthew 11:23], every one that passeth by it shall be astonished. [שָׁמֵם primarily means to be dumb with astonishment, Gesen., Thessalonians 3. p. 1435] and shall hiss [שָׁרַק, like \"hiss,\" is an onomatopoetic word. It does not denote the hissing of terror (Bahr) but of derision; cf. Jeremiah 19:8; Jeremiah 49:17; Job 27:23; Lamentations 2:15, 16. Rawlinson aptly remarks, as bearing on the authorship of the Kings, that this is a familiar word in Jeremiah (see 1 Kings 18:16; 25:9; 29:18; 50:13; 51:37, in addition to the passages cited above), and that the other prophets rarely use it. The fact that much of this charge is in Jeremiah's style, confirms the view taken above (note on ver. 4), that the ipsissima verba of the dream are not preserved to us. The author indeed could hardly do more than preserve its leading ideas, which he would naturally present in his own dress]; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land and to this house?

SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS AND UNDERTAKINGS. - So far the historian has spoken exclusively of the two greatest works of Solomon's reign, the Temple and the Palace, and principally of the former. Even the message just related was, as we have seen, the response to the prayer offered when the temple was consecrated. But he now proceeds to mention other proofs of Solomon's greatness, and of the prosperity of his reign - doubtless because the glory of Israel then reached its climax, and the author would be tempted to linger over these details because of the dark contrast which his own time supplied - and this leads him to speak of the means by which all these enterprises were accomplished. The particulars here given are but fragmentary, and are grouped together in a somewhat irregular manner. It would seem as if both this account and that of the chronicler had been compiled from much more copious histories, each writer having cited those particulars which appeared to him to be the most interesting and important. But the design of the historian in either case is evident, viz.,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) to recount the principal undertakings of this illustrious king, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) to indicate the resources which enabled him to accomplish such ambitious and extensive designs. These latter wereNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the alliance with Hiram, which secured him the necessary materials (vers. 11-14);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the forced labour of the subject races (vers. 20-23); andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the voyages of his fleet (vers. 26-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And it came to pass at the end of twenty years [seven of which were occupied on the temple and thirteen on the palace (1 Kings 7:1) ], when [or, during which.

It was this probably that led to the construction of a fleet] according to all his desire), that then [this is the apodosis to ver. 10] king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities [really they were mere villages. \"It is a genuine Eastern trick to dignify a small present with a pompous name\" (Thomson).

Cf. Jos., Ant. 5.1.18). It is easy to see why this particular region was surrendered to Hiram.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) It was near his country (2 Samuel 24:7);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the people were Phoenicians, allied to Hiram, but strangers to Solomon, both in race and religion;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) Solomon could not with propriety alienate any part of Immanuel's land, or convey to a foreigner the dominion over the people of the Lord.

But the Fellahin of Palestine, the \"modern Canaanites,\" still address each other as \"my father\" or \"my brother.\" See Conder, \"Tent-work,\" p. 332]. And he called them the land of Cabul [The meaning of this word is quite uncertain. The LXX. reads Οριον, which shows that they must have read גבול instead of כבול; indeed, it is possible that the words have the same meaning (Gesen.) Stanley (S. and P. p. 364) thinks these cities formed the boundary between the two kingdoms, and refers to the use of ὅρια in Matthew 15:21; Luke 6:17, etc. According to Josephus, Ξαβαλὼν, is a Phoenician word, meaning displeasing; but his etymologies are to be received with caution, and Gesenius justly pronounces this a mere conjecture from the context. Thenius and Ewald regard the word as compounded of כ and בל = as nothing; Keil connects it with the root חבל, which would yield the meaning pawned or pledged, and hence concludes that, this strip of territory was merely given to Hiram as a security for the repayment of a loan (see below on ver. 14); while Bahr derives it from כבל, an unused root, akin to the preceding - vinxit, constrinxit, and would see in it a name bestowed on the region because of its confined geographical position. He does not understand the word, however, as a term of contempt. \"How,\" he asks, \"could Hiram give the district a permanent name which contained a mockery of himself rather than of the land?\" But the word was obviously an expression of disparagement, if not disgust, which, falling from Hiram's lips, was caught up and repeated with a view to mark not so much his displeasure as Solomon's meanness. But it is not necessary to find a meaning for the word, for it is to be considered that a city Bearing this name existed at that time and in this neighbourhood (Joshua 19:27), the site of which, in all probability, is marked by the modern Kabul, eight miles east of Accho (Robinson, 3:87, 88; Dict. Bib. 1:237; Thomson, \"Land and Book,\" 1:281, 511). It is possible, indeed, that it may have been one of the \"twenty cities\" (ver. 11) given to Hiram. And if this city, whether within or without the district of Galilee, were notorious for its poverty or meanness, or conspicuous by its bleak situation, we can at once understand why Hiram should transfer the name to the adjoining region, even if that name, in itself, had no special significance] unto this day.

This fact is mentioned to explain the gift of the cities, viz., that they were in payment for the gold he had furnished. The timber and stone and labour had been paid for in corn and wine and oil See on 1 Kings 5:11] to the king sixscore talents of gold. [This sum is variously estimated at from half a million to a million and a quarter of our money. (Keil, in loc., and Dict. Bib. 3:1734. It equalled 3000 shekels of the sanctuary (Exodus 38:24-26). Keil, who, as we have seen, interprets Cabul to mean pledged, says somewhat positively that these 120 talents were merely lent to Solomon to enable him to prosecute his undertakings, and that the twenty cities were Hiram's security for its repayment. He further sees in the restoration of these cities (2 Chronicles 8:2, where see note) a proof that Solomon must have repaid the amount lent him. The \"sixscore talents \"should be compared with the 120 talents of ch. 10:10, and the 666 talents of 1 Kings 10:14.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. And this is the reason [or manner, account, דָּבָר. Keil: \"This is the case with regard to,\" etc. The historian now proceeds to speak of the forced labour. The LXX. inserts this and the next nine verses after 1 Kings 10:22] of the levy [see on 1 Kings 5:13, and 1 Kings 12:18] which Solomon raised; for to build [The punctuation of the A.V. is misleading. The Hebrew has no break - \"which Solomon raised for building,\" etc.] the house of the Lord and his own house and Millo [Heb. invariably, the Millo, as in 2 Samuel 5:9; 1 Kings 11:27; 2 Kings 12:20; 2 Chronicles 32:5; LXX. ἡ ἄκρα. The import of the word is much disputed, but Wordsworth has but slight warrant for say. ing that it means fortress. According to some it is an archaic Canaanitish term, \"adopted by the Israelites when they took the town and incorporated into their own nomenclature\" (Dict. Bib. 2. p. 367), an idea which finds some support in Judges 9:6, 20. Mr. Grove would further see in it a name for Mount Zion, ἀκρα being the invariable designation of that part of the city in the Maccabees. But see Joshua, B. J. 5:04.1; Ant. 15:11.5; and Porter, 1. pp. 96, 109. Lewin (\"Siege of Jerusalem,\" p. 256) identifies it with the great platform on which temple and palace alike were built. But the word yields a definite meaning in the ( = aolm], \"the filling in\"). Gesenius Hebrew consequently understands it to mean, a rampart (agger) because this is built up and filled in with stones, earth, etc. And the name would have a special fitness if we might suppose that it was applied to that part of the wall of Jerusalem which crossed the Tyropaeon valley. This ravine, which practically divided the city into two parts, would have been the weakest spot in the line of circumvallation, unless it were partly filled in - it is now completely choked up by debris, etc. - and protected by special fortifications; and, if this were done, and we can hardly doubt it was done (see on 1 Kings 11:27), Hammillo, \"the filling in,\" would be its natural and appropriate name. And its mention, here and elsewhere, in connexion with the wall, lends some support to this view] and the wall of Jerusalem [We learn from 2 Samuel 5:9 that David had already built Millo and the wall. Rawlinson argues from 1 Kings 11:27 that these repairs had been \"hasty, and had now - fifty years later - fallen into decay,\" and that Solomon renewed them. More probably the words indicate an enlargement of the Tyropaeon rampart, and an extension of the walls. See note there and on chap. 3:1. Solomon, no doubt, wished to strengthen the defences of the capital, on which he had expended so much labour, and where there was so much to tempt the rapacity of predatory neighbours] and Hazor [For the defence of the kingdom he built a chain of fortresses \"to form a sort of girdle round the land\" (Ewald). The first mentioned, Hazor, was a place of great importance in earlier times, being the \"head of all those (the northern) kingdoms\" (Joshua 11:10). It stood on an eminence - as indeed, for the sake of security, did all the cities of that lawless age (ib., ver. 13 marg.) - overlooking Lake Merom. It was at no great distance from the north boundary of Palestine, in Naphtali (Joshua 19:36), and being favoured by position, it was strongly fortified - Hazor means fortress - and hence Joshua made a point of destroying it. It appears, however, to have speedily regained its importance, for in Judges 4:2, 17 we find it as the capital of Jabin, king of Canaan. It was selected by Solomon as the best site for a stronghold, which should protect his northern border, and as commanding the approach from Syria. As it is not mentioned in 1 Kings 15:20, it would appear to have escaped in the invasion of Benhadad. Possibly it was too strong for him] and Megiddo [Joshua 12:21; Joshua 17:11; Judges 5:19. This place was chosen partly because of its central position - it stood on the margin of the plain of Esdraelon, the battlefield of Palestine, and the battles fought there prove its strategical importance, Judges 5:19 (cf. 1 Samuel 31:1); 2 Kings 23:29; Judith 3:9, 10 - and partly, perhaps, because the high road from Egypt to Damascus passed through it. It dominated the passes of Ephraim (see Judith 4:7). It has till recently been identified with el-Lejjun (from Legio. Compare our Chester, etc.) (Robinson, 2:116 sqq.; Stanley, S. and P., p. 347; Porter, 286, 287); but Conder (\"Tent-work,\" p. 67) gives good reasons for fixing the site at the \"large ruins between Jezreel and Bethshean, which still bears the name of Mujedd'a, i.e., on the eastern side of the plain] and Gezer [This commanded the approach from Egypt, and would protect the southern frontier of Solomon's kingdom. See Joshua 10:33; Joshua 12:12; Joshua 21:21; Judges 1:29; 2 Samuel 5:25; 1 Chronicles 20:4. It stands on the great maritime plain, and is also on the coast road between Egypt and Jerusalem. The site was identified (in 1874) by M. Clermont Ganneau with Tell Jezer. The name means \"cut off,\" \"isolated\" (Gesen.) \"The origin of the title is at once clear, for the site is an out-lier - to use a geological term - of the main line of hills and the position commands one of the important passes to Jerusalem\" (Conder, p. 6). The mention of Gezer leads to a parenthesis of considerable length (vers. 16-19). The question of the levy is put aside for the time, whilst the historian explains how it was that the king came to build Gezer. He then proceeds to mention the other towns built during the same reign.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer and burnt it with fire [The total destruction of the place and its inhabitants by fire and sword looks more like an act of vengeance for some grave offence than like ordinary warfare], and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city [Though Gezer was allotted to Ephraim (Joshua 16:3) and designated as a Levitical city (ib., 21:21), the Canaanite inhabitants had never been dispossessed (Joshua 16:10; LXX. \"Canaanites and Perizzites;\" cf. Judges 1:29), and they would seem to have enjoyed a sort of independence], and given it for a present [שִׁלֻחִים, dotatio, dowry. It is the custom of the East for the husband to purchase his wife by a present (Genesis 29:18; 2 Samuel 3:14, etc.); but in royal marriages a dowry was often given. \"Sargon gave Cilicia as a dowry with his daughter .... Antiochus Soter gave his claims on Macedonia as a dowry to his step-daughter Phila, when she married Antigonus Gonatas. Coele-Syria and Palestine were promised as a dowry to Ptolemy Epiphanes, when he married Cleopatra, sister of Antiochus the Great,\" etc. (Rawlinson).

But as applied to Beth-boron, etc., \"built\" probably means enlarged, strengthened] and Beth-horon the nether [mentioned in connexion with Gezer, Joshua 16:3 (cf. 10:10). It is deserving of mention that the two cities of Beth-horon still survive in the modern villages of Beitur el-tahta and el-fok,\" names which are \"clearly corruptions of Beth-horon \"the Nether\" and \"the Upper\" (Stanley, S. and P., p. 208): One lies at the foot of the ravine, on an eminence, the other at the summit of the pass. Like Megiddo and Gezer, this town, too, lay on a high road, viz., that between Jerusalem and the sea coast. The selection of Beth-horon for fortification by Solomon is also justified by history - three decisive battles having been fought here (see Joshua 10:10; 1 Macc. 3:13-24, and Jos., Bell Jud. 2.19.8. The object of the king in fortifying this place was to protect the uplands of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim against invasion from the Philistine plain. It is perhaps not unnoteworthy that, according to our author, it was Beth-horon the nether that Solomon \"built,\" as this would naturally have suffered more than its loftier neighbour from war. According to 2 Chronicles 8:5, however, Solomon built Beth-horon the upper also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And Baalath [probably the place mentioned in Joshua 19:44, and therefore a town of Daniel By some it has been identified, but on wholly insufficient grounds - the mention of Tadmor immediately afterwards being the chief - with Baalbek. This is one of the names which prove how ancient and widespread was the worship of Baal (Gesen., Thesaurus, 225; Dict. Bib., 1:147,148) ] and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land. [Whether this isNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the famous Palmyra, orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) Tamar, an obscure town of south Judah, is a question which has been much disputed. It should be stated in the first place that the Cethib has תמר, but the Keri, after 2 Chronicles 8:4, reads תדמר, as do all the versions; and secondly that a Tarnar is mentioned Ezekiel 47:19 and Ezekiel 48:28 a place which may well be identical with \"Hazazon Tamar, which is Engedi\" (2 Chronicles 20:2; cf. Genesis 14:7. In favour of (1) are the following considerations:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the statement of the chronicler that Solomon did build Palmyra (for of the identity of \"Tadmor\" with Palmyra there can be no reasonable doubt; see Dict. Bib. 3:1428).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) The probability that Solomon, with his wide views of commerce, would seize upon and fortify the one oasis in the great Syrian desert in order to establish an entrepot there (see on ver. 19).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) The words \"in the wilderness,\" which, of course, are eminently true of Palmyra. Against it, however, may be urgedNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that Tamar was much more likely to be changed into Tadmor than Tadmor into Tamar.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That this place is distinctly described as \"in the land,\" which, strictly, Palmyra was not. But here it is to be observed that the chronicler omits these words, and that the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate render, \"in the land of the wilderness.\" Keil says our text is manifestly corrupt, and certainly the expression is a singular one. Some would, therefore, alter בארץ into באדם, or into בחמת (after 2 Chronicles 8:4). Both of the emendations, however, while undoubtedly plausible, are purely conjectural. Wordsworth, who thinks Palmyra is meant, says it is described as \"in the land\" to indicate that God had fulfilled his promise to extend the land of Solomon far eastward into the wilderness (Psalm 72:9). And a Jewish historian, especially in the time of his country s decadence, might well recount how this great city had once been comprised within the boundaries of Israel. In favour of (2) are these facts:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That it is the reading of the text. It is said, however, that the ancient name of Tadmor was Tamar, and the place clearly owed its name to the Palm trees. But the name is always Tadmor in the Palmyrene inscriptions.NEWLINENEWLINE(2) That this place was \"in the wilderness,\" i.e., of Judah.NEWLINENEWLINE(3) That it was \"in the land,\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) that it was in close proximity to the places just mentioned. The evidence is thus so evenly balanced that it is impossible to decide positively between the two.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And all the cities of store that Solomon had [cities where the produce of the land was stored for the use of the troops or household, or against a season of scarcity (Genesis 41:35; Exodus 1:11), or possibly (Ewald) they were emporiums for the development of trade. The fact that these store cities are mentioned in the same breath with Tadmor, is an argument for the identification of that place with Palmyra, which Solomon could only have built as a means of gaining or retaining control over the caravan trade between the East and the Mediterranean. Cf. 2 Chronicles 17:12; 2 Chronicles 32:28, and Genesis 41:48. They would seem to have been chiefly on the northern frontier, 2 Chronicles 8:4 (\"in Hamath\"), ib. 2 Chronicles 16:4 speaks of \"the store cities of Napthali.\" It should be remembered that Solomon had an adversary in Damascus], and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen [Cf. 1 Kings 4:26. These were not so much fortresses (vers. 15-18) as places adapted to accommodate his cavalry, etc. For horsemen we should perhaps read horses. See note on 1 Kings 5:6], and that which Solomon desired to build [Heb. and the desire of Solomon which he desired; cf. ver.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The use of the cognate verb refutes the idea that Solomon's \"desire\" is another name for pleasure buildings or pleasaunces, as does also \"desire\" in ver. 11. It is certain, however, that such buildings were erected, and it is probable that they are referred to here] in Jerusalem and in Lebanon [It is highly probable that pleasure houses were built in Lebanon (Song of Solomon 7:4, passim), for which Solomon may well have had a strong affection, and pleasure gardens in Jerusalem (Ecclesiastes 2:4-7). See Stanley, pp. 197-199); and we may reasonably imagine (with Ewald) that in these latter he sought to grow specimens of the plants, etc., about which he \"spoke\" (ch. 4:33; cf. Ecclesiastes 2:5). \"It is a curious fact that in the ground hard by the 'fountains of Solomon' near Bethlehem, which exhibit manifest traces of an ancient garden, and where the intimations of Josephus would lead us to suppose that Solomon had a rural retreat, are still to be found a number of plants self sown from age to age, which do not exist in any other part of the Holy Land\" (Kitto, \"Bib. Illus.\" vol. 4. p. 101). Some of Solomon's journeys to these favourite resorts, we can hardly doubt, are referred to in Song of Solomon 3:6-10; Song of Solomon 4:8 sqq.; Song of Solomon 6:11] and in all the land of his dominion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites [Judges 1:21-36; Judges 3:5; 1 Chronicles 22:2] which were not of the children of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Their children that were left after them in the land [this is explicative of ver. 20], whom the children of Israel also [also is not in the Hebrew, and is meaningless] were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bond service [see on 1 Kings 5:13, and cf.

Keil rightly connects the word with אַז below. \"So soon as.. then.\" Cf. Genesis 27:30. This and ver. 25 are not interposed arbitrarily, as might at first sight appear, but refer to 1 Kings 3:1-4. The completion of the palaces rendered it no longer necessary or proper that Solomon's daughter should dwell in a separate house. The chronicler tells us that she had dwelt in David's palace on Mount Zion, and that Solomon was constrained to remove her, because he looked upon all the precinct as now consecrated (2 Chronicles 8:11) ]. Pharaoh's daughter came up [עָלְתָה. Keil hence argues that the palace stood on higher ground than David's house. But this conclusion is somewhat precarious. The approach to the palace involved an ascent, but Zion was certainly as high as Ophel] out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon [Heb. he] had built for her: then did he build Millo. [Thenius infers from these words that Mille was a fort or castle for the protection of the harem. But there is no warrant for any such conjecture. In the first place, this wife would seem to have been lodged in her own palace apart from the other wives.NEWLINENEWLINE2. We can offer a better explanation of the word Mille (see ver. 15).NEWLINENEWLINE3. The word \"then\" may mean eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1), that when her palace was completed, Solomon then had workmen who were liberated and were employed on Mille (Keil), orNEWLINENEWLINE(2), that when she vacated David's house, the building of Mille could be proceeded with.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And three times in a year [i.e., no doubt at the three feasts, the times of greatest solemnity, and when there was the largest concourse of people. See 2 Chronicles 8:12. The design of this verse may be to show that there was no longer any offering on high places. It would thus refer to 1 Kings 3:2, as ver. 24 to 1 Kings 3:1] did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord [the chronicler adds, \"before the porch\"], and he burnt incense. [It has been supposed by some that Solomon sacrificed and burnt incense propria manu. According to Dean Stanley (\"Jewish Ch.\" 2. pp. 220, 221), \"he solemnly entered, not only the temple courts with sacrifices, but penetrated into the Holy Place itself, where in later years none but the priests were allowed to enter, and offered incense on the altar of incense.\" But this positive statement is absolutely destitute of all basis. For, in the first place, there is nothing in the text to support it. If Solomon ordered, or defrayed the cost of, the sacrifices, etc., as no doubt he did, the historian would properly and naturally describe him as offering burnt offerings. Qui facit per alium facit per se, and priests are expressly mentioned as present at these sacrifices (1 Kings 8:6; 2 Chronicles 5:7-14; 2 Chronicles 7:2, 5). We have just as much reason, and no more, for believing that the king built Mille (ver. 24) with his own hands, and with his own hands \"made a navy of ships\" (ver. 26), as that he sacrificed, etc., in propria persona. And, secondly, it is simply inconceivable, if he had so acted, that it should have attracted no more notice, and that our historian should have passed it over thus lightly. We know what is recorded by our author as having happened when, less than two centuries afterwards, King Uzziah presumed to intrude on the functions of the priests (2 Chronicles 26:17-20); cf. 1 Kings 13:1), and we know what had happened some five centuries before (Numbers 16:35), when men who were not of the seed of Aaron came near to offer incense before the Lord. It is impossible that Solomon could have disregarded that solemn warning without some protest, or without a syllable of blame on the part of our author. And the true account of these sacrifices is that they were offered by the king as the builder of the temple, and probably throughout his life, by the hands of the ministering priests (2 Chronicles 8:14). Thrice in the year he showed his piety by a great function, at which he offered liberally] upon the altar [Heb. upon that, sc. altar אתּו. See Gesen. Lex., p. 94; Ewald, Syntax, 332a (3) ] that was before the Lord. [The altar of incense stood before the entrance to the oracle, the place of the Divine presence. See on 1 Kings 6:22-3. So he finished the house. [Same word, but in the Kal form in 1 Kings 7:51. The Piel form, used here, may convey the deeper meaning, \"he perfected,\" i.e., by devoting it to its proper use.

The chronicler paraphrases by ךאנִיות, plural. This fact finds a record here, probably because it was to the voyages of this fleet that the king was indebted for the gold which enabled him to erect and adorn the buildings recently described. (As to form, etc., of the ships, see Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1014). But no historian could pass over without notice an event of such profound importance to Israel as the construction of its first ships, which, next to the temple, was the great event of Solomon's reign] in Ezion-geber [lit., the backbone of a man (or giant). Cf. Numbers 33:35; Deuteronomy 2:8; 2 Kings 4:22; 2 Chronicles 8:17. The name is probably due, like Shechem (see note on 1 Kings 12:25) to a real or fancied resemblance in the physical geography of the country to that part of the human body. Stanley (S. and P. p. 84) speaks of \"the jagged ranges on each side of the gulf.\" Akaba, the modern name, also means back. 2 Chronicles l.c. says Solomon went to Ezion-geber, which it is highly probable he would do], which is beside [Heb. אֵת = aloud (Gesen., Lex. s.v.)] Eloth [lit., trees akin to Elim, where were palm trees (Exodus 15:27; Exodus 16:1). The name is interesting as suggesting that Solomon may have found some of the timber for the construction of his fleet here. A grove of palm trees \"still exists at the head of the gulf of Akaba\" (Stanley S. and P. p. 20). Palms, it is true, are not adapted to shipbuilding, but other timber may have grown there in a past age. But see note on ver. 27. For Elath, see Porter, p. 40; Deuteronomy 2:8; 2 Samuel 8:14 (which shows how it passed into the hand of Israel); 2 Kings 8:20; 2 Kings 14:22; 2 Kings 16:6. It gave a name to the Elanitic Gulf, now the Gulf of Akaba], on the shore [Heb. lip] of the Red sea [Heb. Sea of Rushes. LXX. ἡ ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα. The redness is due to subaqueous vegetation. \"Fragments of red coral are forever being thrown up from the stores below, and it is these coral-line forests which form the true 'weeds' of this fantastic sea\" (Stanley, S. and P. p. 83). There is also apparently a bottom of red sandstone (ib. p. 6, note). It is divided by the Sinaitic peninsula into two arms or gulfs, the western being the Gulf of Suez, and the eastern the Gulf of Akabah. The former is 130 miles, the latter 90 miles long], in the land of Edom.

[The chronicler states (2 Chronicles 8:18) that he sent ships as well as servants, and it has been thought that ships were transported, in parts or entire, by land across the Isthmus of Suez, and there are certainly instances on record of the land transport of fleets. (Keil reminds us that Alexander the Great, according to Arrian, had snips transported - in pieces - from Phoenicia to the Euphrates, and that, according to Thucydides (Bell. Pelop. 4:8) the Peloponnesians conveyed 60 ships from Corcyra across the Leucadian Isthmus, etc.) But this, especially when the state of engineering science, etc., among the Hebrews is taken into account, is hardly to be thought cf. It is quite possible, however, that timber for shipbuilding was floated on the Mediterranean down to the river of Egypt, or some such place, and then transported either to Suez or to Akaba. Probably all that the chronicler means is that Hiram provided the materials and had the ships built. The Israelites, having hitherto had no fleet, and little or no experience of the sea, were unable to construct ships for themselves. And the Tyrians may have seen in the construction of a fleet for eastern voyages, an opening for the extension of their own maritime trade. Possibly in the first voyages Tyriaus and Jews were copartners.]NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Kings9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And they came to Ophir [It is perhaps impossible to identify this place with any degree of precision. The opinions of scholars may, however, be practically reduced to two, The first would place Ophir in India; the second in southern Arabia. In favour of India isNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the three years' voyage (but see on 1 Kings 10:22);NEWLINENEWLINE(2) most of the other treasures brought back by the fleet, exclusive of gold, are Indian products. But against it is urged the important fact that no gold is now found there, south of Cashmere, whilst south Arabia was famed for its abundant gold (Psalm 72:15; Ezekiel 27:22). On the other hand, it is alleged that in ancient times India was rich in gold (Ewald, 3. p. 264), and that there are no traces of gold mines in Arabia. The question is discussed at considerable length and with great learning by Mr. Twisleton (Dict. Bib. art. \"Ophir\"). He shows that it is reasonably certainNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the Ophir of Genesis 10:29 is the name of some city, region, or tribe in Arabia, andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the Ophir of Genesis is the Ophir of the Book of Kings. And Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, al. agree with him in locating Ophir in the latter country. Ewald, however, sees in Ophir \"the most distant coasts of India,\" and it is probable that the Hebrews used the word somewhat loosely, as they did the corresponding word Tarshish, and as we do the words East and West Indies. They were not geographers, and Ophir may have been merely an emporium where the products of different countries were collected, or a nomen generale for \"all the countries lying on the African, Arabian, or Indian seas, so far as at that time known\" (Heeren). See on 1 Kings 10:5], and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents [The chronicler says 450. The discrepancy is easily accounted for, 20 being expressed by כ; 50 by נ. Wordsworth suggests that \"perhaps thirty were assigned to Hiram for his help\"] and brought it to king Solomon.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
