For the inscription, comp. Romans 1:1, 5; 1 Corinthians 1:1; 2 Corinthians 1:1; Galatians 1:1; Ephesians 1:1; Colossians 1:1; 2 Timothy 1:1; Titus 1:1; in all which St. Paul asserts his apostleship, and ascribes it directly to \"the will of God\" (comp. Galatians 1:11, 12, etc.). According to the commandment (as Titus 1:3) expresses the same truth, but possibly with a more direct reference to the command, \"Separate me Paul and Barnabas,\" recorded in Acts 13:2. This assertion of his apostolic authority indicates that this is not a private letter to Timothy, but a public Church document for all time. Our hope (comp. Colossians 1:27; Acts 28:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - My true child in faith for my own son in the faith, A.V.; peace for and peace, A.V.; the Father for our Father, A.V. and T.R.; Christ Jesus for Jesus Christ, A.V. and T.R. My true child in faith. A most awkward phrase, which can only mean that Timothy was St. Paul's true child because his faith was equal to St. Paul's, which is not St. Paul's meaning. Timothy was St. Paul's own son, because he had begotten him in the gospel (1 Corinthians 4:14-16; Philemon 1:10) - his spiritual son. This is best expressed as in the A.V. by \"in the faith\" (comp. Titus 1:4, where the same idea is expressed by κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν). Grace, mercy, and peace. This varies from the blessing at the beginning of the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians, by the addition of the word \"mercy,\" as in 2 Timothy 1:2 and Titus 1:4 in the T.R., and also in 2 John 3 and Jude 1:2. It seems in St. Paul to connect itself with that deeper sense of the need and of the enjoyment of mercy which went with his deepening sense of sin as he drew towards his end, and harmonizes beautifully with what he says in vers. 12-16. The analogy of the other forms of blessing quoted above strongly favors the sense our Father rather than the Father. Whether we read ἡμῶν with the T.R. or omit it with the R.T., the idea of Father is contrasted, not with that of Son, but with that of Lord; the two words express the relation of the Persons of the Godhead, not to each other, but to the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Exhorted for besought, A.V.; tarry for abide still, A.V.; was going for went, A.V.; certain men for some, A.V.; not to teach a different for that they teach no other, A.V. Exhorted (παρεκάλεσα). In about sixty places this word has the sense of \"beseech,\" \"entreat,\" \"desire,\" \"pray,\" which is more suitable to this passage than the R.V. exhort. It is a strong expression, and seems to imply that Timothy had been anxious to go with St. Paul to Macedonia, to share his labors and wait upon him; but that St. Paul, with that noble disinterestedness which characterized his whole life, had, not without difficulty, persuaded him to abide at Ephesus. Tarry. Here again the R.V. is unfortunate. The exact sense of προσμεῖναι is \"to stay on,\" or, as in the A.V., \"to abide still.\" The word tells us that Timothy was already at Ephesus when he received the request from St. Paul to stay on there instead of going to Macedonia. There is nothing in the phrase that implies that St. Paul was at Ephesus himself when he made the request to Timothy. It may have been made by message or by letter. When I was going. Some commentators have endeavored to explain πορευόμενος as applying to Timothy, or as if the order were ἵνα πορευόμενος παραγγείλῃς; but the Greek will not admit of it. Charge (παραγγείλῃς); a word implying authority, almost invariably rendered \"command\" or \"charge.\" It is taken up in ver. 18 (ταύτην τὴν παραγγελίαν), \"This charge,\" etc. Teach a different doctrine (ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν). This is one of the many words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles. It only occurs here and 1 Timothy 6:3. It is formed from ἑτεροδιδάσκαλος, a teacher of other than right doctrine, and means \"to play the part of a teacher of other than right doctrine,\" just as in ecclesiastical language ἐτερόδοξος means \"one who holds opinions contrary to that which is orthodox,\" and such as do so are said ἑτεροδοξεῖν. The classical sense is a little different, \"one who holds a different opinion\" - \"to be of a different opinion.\" The introduction of the word into the vocabulary of Scripture is a sign of the somewhat later age to which this Epistle belongs, when heresies were growing and multiplying. Other similar compounds are ἑτερόγλωσσος (1 Corinthians 14:21) and ἑτεροζυγεῖν (2 Corinthians 6:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - To give for give, A.V.; the which for which, A.V.; questionings for questions, A.V.; a dispensation of God for godly edifying, A.V. and T.R. (οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ for οἰκοδομίαν Θεοῦ); so do I now for so do, A.V. Fables (see 1 Timothy 4:7). If the spirit which gave birth to the fables of the Talmud was already at work among the Jews, we have a ready explanation of the phrase. And that they were Jewish fables (not later Gnostic delusions) is proved by the parallel passage in Titus 1:14, \"Not giving heed to Jewish fables.\" The prevalence of sorcery among the Jews at this time is a further instance of their inclination to fable (see Acts 8:9; Acts 13:6; Acts 19:13). Endless genealogies. What was the particular abuse of genealogies which St. Paul here condemns we have not sufficient historical knowledge to enable us to decide. But that they were Jewish forms of \"vain talking,\" and not Gnostic, and related to human pedigrees, not to \"emanations of eons,\" may be concluded from the connection in which they are mentioned in Titus 3:9, and from the invariable meaning of the word γενεαλογία itself. It is true that Irenaeus ('Contr. Haer.,' lib. 1.) applies this passage to the Valentinians and their succession of eons (Bythus, Nous, Logos, Anthropus, etc. - in all thirty, male and female); and so does Tertullian, who speaks of the seeds of the Gnostic heresies as already budding in St. Paul's days ('Advers Valentin.,' cap 3. and elsewhere), and Grotius supports thin explanation ('Comment.,' 1 Timothy 1:4). But it was very natural that Irenaeus and Tertullian, living when the heresies of Valentinus, Marcion, and others were at their height, should so accommodate St. Paul's words - which is all that Irenaeus does. On the other band, neither Irenaeus nor Tertullian shows that γενεαλογία was a word applied to the emanations of the eons in the Gnostic vocabulary. The genealogies, then, were Jewish pedigrees, either used literally to exalt individuals as being of priestly or Davidic origin (as the pedigrees of the Desposyni, or later of the princes of the Captivity), or used cabbalistically, so as to draw fanciful doctrines from the names composing a genealogy, or in some other way which we do not know of (see the writers 'Genealogies of Christ,' 1 Timothy 3. § 2:1; and note C at the end of the volume). Endless (ἀπέραντος); found only here in the New Testament and so one of the words peculiar to the pastoral Epistles, but used in the LXX. for \"infinite,\" \"immeasurable.\" It means either \"endless,\" \"interminable,\" or, \"having no useful end or purpose;\" οὐδὲν χρήσιμον (Chrysostom). But the former (\"interminable\") is the better rendering, and in accordance with its classical use. Questionings (ζητήσεις or ἐκζητήσεις, R.T.). (For ζητησις, see John 3:25; Acts 25:20; and below, 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9; and for the kindred ζήτημα, Acts 15:2; Acts 18:15; Acts 23:29; Acts 25:19; Acts 26:3.) The reading ἐκζήτησις is only found here. A dispensation of God. This version arises from the Greek οἰκονομίαν, which is the reading of the R.T. and almost all manuscripts. The T.R. οἰκοδομίαν ισ thought to be a conjecture of Erasmus, which, from its much easier sense, was taken into the T.R. Taking the reading οἰκονομίαν, the phrase, \"a dispensation of God which is in faith,\" must mean the gospel as delivered by revelation and received by faith. These fables and genealogies address themselves, the apostle says, to the disputatious, itching curiosity of men's minds, not to their faith. The substance of them is matter of doubtful disputation, not revealed truth. \"The dispensation\" is better English than \"a dispensation.\" So do I now; or, as the A.V., so do, is the conjectural filling up of the unfinished sentence which began \"as I exhorted thee.\" But it is much more natural and simple to take ver. 18 as the apodosis, and the intermediate verses as a digression caused by St. Paul's desire to show how exactly the charge was in agreement with the true spirit of the Law of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But for now, A.V.; charge for commandment, A.V.; love for charity, A.V.; a good for of a good, and faith for of faith, A.V. But the end of the charge. Before proceeding with his sentence, in which he was about solemnly to commit the trust of the episcopate of the Church of Ephesus to Timothy, he breaks off abruptly to show the beneficent character of the charge, viz. the furtherance of that brotherly love and purity of heart and life which are the true fruit of the gospel dispensation, but which some, by their false doctrine, were so ruthlessly impeding. Each of these phrases, \"a pure heart\" and \"a good conscience\" and \"faith unfeigned,\" seems to rebuke by contrast the merely ceremonial cleanness and the defiled conscience and the merely nominal Christianity of these heretical Judaizers (comp. Titus 1:10-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Which things for which, A.V.; talking for jangling, A.V. Having swerved (ἀστοχήσαντες); literally, having missed the mark, as in the margin. It is found in the New Testament only here and 1 Timothy 6:21; 2 Timothy 2:18. In Ecclesiastes 7:19 (Ecclesiastes 7:21, A.V.) and 8:9 (Ecclesiastes 8:11, A.V.) it is used in a slightly different sense, \"forego\" and \"miss.\" In Polybius and Plutarch repeatedly, \"to miss the mark.... to fail,\" with the kindred ἄστοχος ἀστοχία αστόχημα, These men missed the true end of the gospel - purity of heart and conscience and life - and only reached vain and boastful talking. Have turned aside (ἐξετράπησαν); 1 Timothy 5:15; 1 Timothy 6:20; 2 Timothy 4:4; Hebrews 12:13; but not elsewhere in the New Testament. It is found in the active voice in the LXX., and is common in all voices in classical Greek. Vain talking (ματαιολογία); here only in the New Testament, and not feared in the LXX., but used by Strabo, Plutarch, and Porphyry. The adjective ματαιολόγος is used in Titus 1:10, and applied especially to those \"of the circumcision.\" The Latin equivalents are vaniloquus and vaniloquium. Livy's description of a vaniloquus is \"Maria terrasque inani sonitu verborum complevit\" (lib. 35:48; comp. Jude 1:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDesiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Though they understand for understanding. A.V.; confidently affirm for affirm, A.V. Teachers of the Law (νομοδιδάσκαλοι. as Luke 5:17; Acts 5:34). This, again, distinctly marks the Jewish origin of these heretics. Though they understand, etc. So our Lord rebuke,1 the scribes and teachers of the Law in his day: \"Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God;\" \"Ye do greatly err\" (Matthew 22:29; Mark 12:27; Matthew 12:7, etc.; compare, too, Romans 2:17-24). They confidently affirm (διαβεβαιοῦνται). Elsewhere in the New Testament only in Titus 3:8, \"I will that thou affirm confidently.\" So in classical Greek, \"to maintain strongly,\" \"to be positive.\" This was right in the minister of Christ declaring Divine truth, but very wrong in these vain janglers. The nature of their confident assertions is apparent from what follows - they spoke of the Law, but not lawfully.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Law is good (see the similar statement in Romans 7:12). The Jews thought that St. Paul spoke against the Law (comp. Acts 6:13, 14), because he vindicated its true use (Romans 10:4; Galatians 3:24; Galatians 4:4, 5, etc.). But he everywhere speaks of the Law as good and holy. If a man - i.e., a teacher of the Law - use it lawfully; knowing its proper use, as it follows in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As knowing for knowing, A.V.; Law for the Law, A.V.; unruly for disobedient, A.V.; and sinners for and for sinners, A.V.; the unholy for unholy, A.V. Law is not made for a righteous man. It is much better to render νόμος, with the A.V., \"the Law,\" as e.g., Romans 2:12-14. The whole proposition relates to the Law of Moses, which these teachers perverted and tried to force upon Christians, being ignorant that the Law was made, not for the righteous, but for sinners. For is not made, we might render does not apply to or is not in force against. Κεῖται with the dative following (as 2 Macc. 4:11) suggests some such meaning, somewhat different from the simple νόμος κεῖται. This freedom of the righteous from the Law is what St. Paul everywhere asserts (Romans 6:14; Romans 8:2; Galatians 2:19; Galatians 3:25; Galatians 5:18, etc.), the Law being viewed, not as a holy rule of life, but as a system of penalties - \"a Law of sin and death.\" That νόμος here means the Law of Moses is further evident from this, that in the following list the apostle clearly follows the general order of the Decalogue, taking first the offences against the first table, and then sins against the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth commandments (compare, too, ver. 11 with Romans 2:16). Lawless (ἀνόμοις); with no special reference to its etymology, but meaning simply \"transgressors,\" \"wicked,\" as Luke 22:37; Acts 2:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:8 (A.V.), and very frequently in the LXX. Unruly (ἀνυποτάκτοις); insubordinate, resisting lawful authority. In the LXX. for the Hebrew בְלִיַעִל (1 Samuel 2:12, Symmachus),and perhaps Proverbs 16:27. In the New Testament it is peculiar in this sense to the pastoral Epistles, being only found here and in Titus 1:6, 10 In Hebrews 2:10 it has the classical sense of \"unsubdued.\" The express application of the word in Titus 1:10, to the \"unruly talkers of the circumcision,\" shows that St. Paul has them in view here also. Ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane. All terms implying offences against the first table. Ἀσεβέσι, (with the kindred ἀσεβεία and ἀσεβέω) is always rendered \"ungodly,\" \"ungodliness,\" \"to act ungodly;\" ἁμαρτωλοῖς, sinners, viz. against God; ἀνοσίοις, unholy (found only here and at 2 Timothy 3:2 in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX.) is the contrary to ὅσιος, holy, saintly; βεβήλοις (whence βεβηλόω, to profane, Matthew 12:5; Acts 24:6), profane, of persons and things not consecrated to God - peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 4:7; 1 Timothy 6:20; 2 Timothy 2:16;) and Hebrews 12:16, but found commonly in the LXX. and in classical Greek. Πατραλῶαις and μητραλῴαις, not murderers, but, as in the margin, \"smiters, ill-users of father and mother.\" Both words are only found here in the New Testament, but found in Demosthenes, Aristophanes, etc. The allusion here is to Exodus 21:15, where the Hebrew word for \"smiteth\" is XXX, which does not necessarily mean \"to smite to death\" any more than ἀλοάω does. Ἀνδροφόνοις, man-slayers; found only here in the New Testament, but used in 2 Macc. 9:28 and in classical writers. The reference is to Exodus 21:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Fornicators for whoremongers, A.V.; abusers of themselves with men for them that defile themselves with mankind, A.V.; false swearers for perjured persons. A.V.; contrary for that is contrary, A.V.; the sound for sound, A.V. Πόρνοις ἀρσενοκοίταις. The latter word is only found in the New Testament here and 1 Corinthians 6:9. and nowhere else; but the reference is to Leviticus 18:22, where the two words ἄρσενος and κοίτη occur, though not in actual composition. Ἀνδραποδισταῖς, men-stealers; only here in the New Testament, but very common, with its many kindred forms, ἀνδραποδίζειν ἀνδραποδισμός, ἀνδράποδον, etc., in classical Greek. The last word is found once in the LXX., viz. in 3Macc. 7:5. The crime of man-stealing is denounced Exodus 21:16; Deuteronomy 24:7. Ψεύσταις ἐπιόρκοις, liars, false swearers. The latter word only occurs here in the New Testament - the verb ἐπιορκέω in Matthew 5:33 - and twice in the LXX., where ἐπιορκία is also found (Wisd. 14:25); all are common in classical Greek. The reference is to Leviticus 19:11, 12. The order of the offences, as above noted, is that of the Decalogue. The sound doctrine. The article is better omitted, as in the A V. This is one of the many phrases peculiar to the pastoral Epistles. Though the verb ὑγιανίνειν occurs three times in St. Luke's Gospel and once in 3 John 1:2 in its literal sense of bodily health, it is only in the pastoral Epistles that it is applied to doctrine (see 1 Timothy 6:3; 2 Timothy 1:13; 2 Timothy 4:3; Titus 1:9, 13; Titus 2:1, 2; and note on 2 Timothy 4:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The gospel of the glory for the glorious gospel, A,V. The gospel of the glory of the blessed God. The phrase, τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς δόξης τοῦ μακαρίου Θεοῦ, cannot mean, as in the A.V., \"the glorious gospel of the blessed God,\" except by a very forced construction. It might mean three things:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ might be a periphrasis for \"God,\" as Romans 6:4, or Exodus 24:16, 17; Exodus 33:18; Leviticus 9:6, 23; Psalm 104:31; 2 Corinthians 4:6; or as \"the Name of the Lord\" (Proverbs 18:10; Isaiah 30:27, etc.); and as we say \"thee queen's majesty,\" the \"king's grace.\" OrNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"the glory of God\" might mean Jesus Christ, who is the Brightness of God's glory, the Image of the invisible God, in whose face the glory of God shines (2 Corinthians 4:4, 6). OrNEWLINENEWLINE(3) it might mean the gospel which tells of the glory of God, which reveals and proclaims his glory, the glory of his grace (Ephesians 1:6, 12), or perhaps here rather the glory of his holiness, which St. Paul's \"sound doctrine\" pressed for imitation upon all Christians (see 1 Timothy 6:3); comp. 2 Corinthians 4:4, \"The gospel of the glory of Christ.\" Either the first or last is doubtless the true meaning. The blessed God. This and 1 Timothy 6:15 are the only passages in the New Testament where μακάριος, blessed, is an epithet of God. Elsewhere \"blessed\" is εὐλογητός; as e.g. Mark 14:61; 2 Corinthians 11:31. In classical Greek μάκαρ is the proper epithet of the gods; μάκαρες Θεόι μακάριος is usually spoken of men or qualities, and especially of the happy dead. It does not appear how or why the apostle here applies μακάριος to God. Committed to my trust; literally, with which I was entrusted. A thoroughly Pauline statement (comp. Romans 1:1, 5; Romans 2:16; Galatians 1:11, 12; Ephesians 3:1-8, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I thank for and I thank, A.V. and T.R.; him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord for Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, A.V.; appointing me to his service for putting me into the ministry, A.V. I thank, etc. This outburst of praise for the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ, who had called him to the ministry of the Word, is caused by the thought, which immediately precedes, of his being entrusted with the gospel. He thus disclaims any notion of merit on his part. That enabled me (ἐνδυναμώσαντι). This verb occurs once in the Acts (Acts 9:22); three times in St. Paul's other Epistles (Romans 4:20; Ephesians 6:10; Philippians 4:13); three times in the pastoral Epistles (here; 2 Timothy 2:1 and 2 Tim 4:17); and Hebrews 11:31. It denotes the giving that peculiar power which was the gift of the Holy Ghost, and which was necessary for the work of an apostle to enable him to bear witness to Christ in the face of an adverse world. This power (δύναμις) Christ promised to his apostles before his ascension (Acts 1:8). St Paul received it after his conversion (Acts 9:22). He continued to hold it throughout his apostleship (Philippians 4:13); he enjoyed it especially at the approach of his martyrdom (2 Timothy 4:17). It comprised strength of faith, strength to testify and to preach, strength to endure and suffer. St. Paul's whole course is the best illustration of the nature of the δύναμις which Christ gave him (see in Ephesians 3:6 the χάρις, the διακονία, and the δύναμις all brought together as here). Appointing me to his service. The A.V., putting me into the ministry, is a better rendering, because\" the ministry\" exactly expresses the particular kind of service to which the Lord appointed him (see the exactly parallel passage, Ephesians 3:7). The absence of the article is unimportant (Romans 12:7; 1 Corinthians 16:15; 2 Timothy 4:11). (For the general phrase, comp. Acts 20:28; 1 Corinthians 12:28; or, still more exactly as regards the grammar, 1 Thessalonians 5:9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Though I was for who was, A.V. and T.R.; howbeit for but, A.V. A blasphemer (βλάσημον); applied, as here, to persons, only in 2 Timothy 3:2; applied to words, Acts 6:11, 13 (T.R.). The verb βλασφημεῖν, and the substantive βλασφημία, are very common, both in the sense of \"blaspheming\" and of \"railing\" or \"reviling.\" St. Paul was a blasphemer because he spoke against the Name of Jesus, which he had since discovered was a Name above all names. A persecutor (διώκτης); only here; but the verb διωκεῖν is applied to St. Paul repeatedly (Acts 9:4, 5; Acts 22:4; Acts 26:11, etc.), and the διώκτης here refers possibly to that very narrative. Injurious (ὑβριστής); only here and Romans 1:30, where it is rendered \"insolent,\" R.V. The verb ὑβρίζειν, both in the New Testament and in classical Greek, means to \"treat or use others despitefully,\" \"to outrage and insult\" them, not without personal violence (Matthew 22:6; Luke 18:32; Acts 14:5; 1 Thessalonians 2:2). The ὑβριστής is one who so treats others. St. Paul was thinking of his own conduct toward the Christians, whom he not only reviled, but handled roughly and east into prison (Acts 8:3; Acts 9:1; Acts 22:19). There is no English word which exactly renders ὑβριστής.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Abounded exceedingly for was exceeding abundant, A.V.

Graec., lib. 5. cap. 1\" (Schleusuer). But the word is thoroughly Pauline (comp. ὑπεραίρομαι ὑπεραυξάνωὑπερβάλλω ὑπερεκτείνω ὑπερπερισσεύω ὑπεροψόω, and other compounds with ὑπέρ. It is further remarkable, as regards ὑπέρ itself, that of the hundred and fifty-eight times (or thereabouts) that it occurs in the New Testament, one hundred and six are in St. Paul's Epistles, and twelve in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and only forty in all the other books. With faith and love, etc. The grace bestowed upon St. Paul at and after his conversion showed itself in the wonderful faith and love toward Jesus Christ, whom he had previously disbelieved in and reviled, which accompanied that grace (μετὰ) and was the fruit of it, and characterized his whole after-life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Faithful is the saying for this is a faithful saying, A.V. Faithful is the saying (πιστὸς ὁ λόγος). This formula is peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 3:1; 1 Timothy 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 3:8), and seems to indicate that there were a number of pithy sayings, maxims, portions of hymns or of catechetical teaching, current in the Church, and possibly originating in the inspired sayings of the Church prophets, to which the apostle appeals, and to which he gives his sanction. The one appealed to here would be simply, \"Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.\" This, St. Paul adds, is worthy of all acceptation - by all, and without any reserve. Acceptation (ἀποδοχῆς); only here and 1 Timothy 4:9, in connection with the same formula. The verb ἀποδέχομαι occurs in Luke 8:40; Acts 2:41; Acts 15:4; 18:29; 24:3; 28:30. It contains the idea of a glad, willing acceptance (see note on Acts 2:41). So doubtless ἀποδοχή also means \"hearty reception.\" I am chief; in respect of his having been\" a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious.\" That great sin was indeed freely forgiven by God's grace, but it could never be forgotten by him who had been guilty of it. \"Manet alta mente repostum\" (comp. Ephesians 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - As chief for first, A.V.; might Jesus Christ for Jesus Christ might, A.V.; his long-suffering for long-suffering, A.V.; an ensample of for a pattern to, A.V.; unto eternal life for to life everlasting, A.V. That in me as chief; rather, as A.V., first; i.e. both in order of time, and in respect also of the greatness of the sin forgiven. Show forth (ἐνδείξηται; see 2 Timothy 4:14, note). All his long-suffering; more properly, as Alford, the whole long-suffering; i.e. the entirety of long-suffering - all that was possible, every kind and degree of long-suffering. Ὁ πᾶς with the substantive denotes the whole of a thing: τὸν πάντα χρόνον, \"the whole time\" (Acts 20:18); ὁ πᾶς νόμος, \"the whole Law\" (Galatians 5:14). So in the two examples from Polybius, τῆς πάσης ἀλογιστίας and τῆς πάσης ἀτοπίας \"the utmost unreasonableness,\" and \"the utmost strangeness,\" the construction is exactly the same. Long-suffering (μακροθυμια); more literally, long-animity; very frequent both in the New Testament and in the LXX. The adjective μακρόθυμος (LXX.) is a translation of the Hebrew קְצַר אַפַיִם, \"long,\" or \"slow to anger,\" to which the opposite is אֶרֶך, ὀξύθυμος (LXX.), \"short to anger,\" i.e. hasty, passionate. The verb μακροθυμέω also occurs frequently, both in the New Testament and in the LXX.: Ἡ ἀγάπη μακροθυμεῖ, \"Charity suffereth long\" (1 Corinthians 13:4). For an example (πρὸς ὑποτύπωσιν). The word only occurs in the New Testament here and 2 Timothy 1:12; but both it and the verb ὑποτυπόω are good classical words. The meaning of ὑπότύπωσις is \"a sketch\" or \"outline,\" and hence a \"pattern.\" This pattern is spoken of as being the property of, being for the use of, them which should hereafter believe. Just as the workman looks at his plan, or outline, by which he is to work, so those future believers would see in Christ's dealings with St. Paul the exact pattern of the long-suffering which they might expect for themselves. Others take ὑποτύπωσις in the sense of \"instruction,\" but this sense cannot be made good. Believe on him unto eternal life. These words hang together. The particular force of πιστεύειν ἐπ αὐτῷ, \"found in the New Testament only here and Romans 9:33; Romans 10:11; and 1 Peter 2:6\" (Huther) - as distinguished from the other constructions of to πιστεύειν - is \"rest,\" \"lean on\" (Ellicott). St. Paul thus incidentally affirms that his own faith rested upon Jesus Christ in the full assurance of attaining to eternal life (see 1 Timothy 6:12; 2 Timothy 1:1, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Incorruptible for immortal, A.V.; only God for only wise God, A.V. and T.R. The King eternal. The Greek has the unusual phrase, τῷ βασιλεῖ τῶν αἰώνων, \"the king of the worlds or ages,\" which is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is found twice in the LXX. - Tobit 13:6 and 10-and in the Liturgy of St. James, in the εὐχὴ τῆς ἐνάρξεως and elsewhere. The similar phrase, ὁ Θεὸς τῶν αἰώνων, is also found in Ecclus. 36:17. In all these passages it is quite clear that the phrase is equivalent to αἰώνιος, Eternal, as a title of the Lord, as in Romans 16:26. The genitive τῶν αἰώνων is qualitative. In Tobit 13:6 he is \"the Lord of righteousness,\" i.e. the righteous Lord; and \"the King of the ages,\" i.e. of eternity, i.e. \"the eternal King,\" the King through all the ages. And in ver. 10 it is said, \"Bless the eternal King,\" who, it follows, will, as King, \"love the miserable εἰς πάσας τᾶς γενέας τοῦ αἰῶνος;\" and then it follows, in ver. 12, \"They that love thee shall be blessed εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα;\" and again in ver. 18, \"Bless the Lord, who hath exalted Jerusalem εἰς πάντας τοὺς αἰῶνας;\" and the same conception is in the phrase, σὺ εῖ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν αἰώνων. Satan, on the other hand. is (ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου, \"the god of this world\" (compare such passages as Psalm 102:24; Psalm 104:31; Psalm 105:8; Psalm 135:13; Psalm 145:13; and the doxology in the Lord's Prayer, \"Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, εἰς, τοὺς αἰῶνας). It seems to be, therefore, quite certain that St. Paul is here using a familiar Jewish phrase for \"eternal\" which has nothing whatever to do with Gnostic eons. Perhaps in the use of the phrase, βασιλεὺς τῶν αἰώνων, we may trace a contrast passing through the writer's mind between the short-lived power of that hateful βασιλεύς, Nero, by whom his life would soon be taken away, and the kingdom of the eternal King (comp. 1 Timothy 6:15, 16). Incorruptible (ἀφθάρτῳ); applied to God also in Romans 1:23, where, as here, it means \"immortal\" (ὁ μόνος ἔχων ἀθανασίαν, 1 Timothy 6:16), not subject to the corruption of death, just as ἀφθαρσία is coupled with \"life\" (2 Timothy 1:10) and opposed to \"death\" So on the other hand, φθορά means \"death.\" φθαρτός, \"perishable.\" Elsewhere it is applied to a crown, to the raised dead, to the inherit-ante of the saints, to the seed of the new birth, to the apparel of a holy heart, which no rust or moth corrupts (1 Corinthians 9:25; 1 Corinthians 15:52; 1 Peter 1:4, 23; 1 Peter 3:4). Invisible (ἀοράτῳ); as Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 11:27. (See also Romans 1:20; and comp. 1 Timothy 6:16, for the sense.) The word is used by Philo of God, and of the Word. Here it is especially predicated of God the Father, according to what our Lord says (John 1:18; John 6:46; John 14:9); though some of the Fathers, Nicene and post-Nicene, predicate it also of the Word or Second Person (Hilary, Chrysostom, etc.). But in Scripture the Son is spoken of as the Manifestation, the Image (εἰκών and χαρακτήρ) of the Father, through whom t he Father is seen and known; ἀόρατος, therefore, applies to the Father (see Bishop Lightfoot's note on Colossians 1:15). The only God. The best manuscripts omit σοφῷ, which seems to have crept in here from Romans 16:26. The exact construction is, \"To the eternal King, the Immortal, the Invisible, the only God [or, 'who alone is God'], be honor,\" etc. Be honor and glory. A little varied from St. Paul's usual doxologies (see Romans 11:36; 6:27; Galatians 1:5; Ephesians 3:21; and 1 Timothy 6:16, where δόξα stands alone, and has the article - Ellicott on Galatians 1:5). In Romans 2:10 δόξα and τιμή are coupled together, but applied to man. This interposition of doxology is quite in St. Paul's manner.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - My child for son, A.V.; by them thou mayest for thou by them mightest, A.V.; the good for a good, A.V. This charge. The apostle now picks up the thread which he had dropped at ver. 4, and solemnly commits to Timothy the episcopal care of the Ephesian Church, for which he had bid him stop at Ephesus. Omitting the long digression in vers. 5-17, the sense runs clearly thus: \"As I besought thee to tarry at Ephesus in order that thou mightest charge some not to teach a different doctrine, so now do I place this charge in thy hands, according to the prophecies which pointed to thee, that thou mayest war the good warfare according to the tenor of them.\" He thus adds that he entrusted this charge to Timothy, not mero motu, but according to direct indications of the Holy Ghost, through the prophets of the Church, which pointed out Timothy as the person who was to war that good warfare. The words, ἵνα στρατεύῃ ἐν αὐταῖς τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν, might possibly depend upon τὰς προαγούσας ἐπί σε, meaning that those prophecies had this end in pointing to Timothy, viz. that he might war the good warfare, that he might be placed in the difficult post of στρατηγός, and the ἐν αὐταῖς follows rather more naturally in this case. But it is, perhaps, better to take them as dependent upon παρατίθεμαι. By them (ἐν αὐταῖς). Here ἐν may be either the causae efficiens, indicating that by the influence of these prophecies Timothy would war the good warfare, or be equivalent to κατὰ, \"according to\" (see Schleusner's 'Lexicon').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHolding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thrust from them for put away, A.V.; made shipwreck concerning the faith for concerning faith have made shipwreck, A.V. Thrust from them. The addition \"from them\" is meant to give the force of the middle voice as in Acts 7:39, A.V. The verb ἀπώθομαι occurs Acts 7:27, 39; Romans 11:1, 2. It is a strong expression, implying here the willful resistance to the voice of conscience. The form ἀπωθέω, -έομαι is found, Acts 13:46, and frequently in the LXX. Which (ἥν) applies to the good conscience only. Hence the important lesson that deviations from the true faith are preceded by violations of the conscience. The surest way to maintain a pure faith is to maintain a good and tender conscience (camp. 1 Timothy 2:9; John 7:17). The faith. It is by no means certain that ἡ πίστις here means \"the faith\" rather than \"faith\" (subjectire). Both the grammar and the sense equally admit the rendering \"faith,\" referring to the preceding, tiaras. (For the phrase, περὶ τὴν πίστιν, \"with respect to,\" camp. 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 2:18; Titus 2:7.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Delivered for have delivered, A.V.; might be taught for may learn, A.V. Hymenaeus; probably the same as is mentioned 2 Timothy 2:17, 18, as holding heretical doctrine concerning the resurrection, and overthrowing the faith of some. It is an uncommon name, though borne by a Bishop of Alexandria in the second century, and by a Bishop of Jerusalem in the third. Alexander; doubtless the same as \"Alexander the coppersmith\" of 2 Timothy 4:14. I delivered unto Satan. The passages in Scripture which throw light on this difficult phrase are, chiefly, the following: the almost identical passage, 1 Corinthians 5:5; Job 1:12; Job 2:6, 7; Luke 13:10; Acts 5:5, 10; Acts 10:38; Acts 13:11; 1 Corinthians 11:30; 2 Corinthians 12:7; and Hebrews 2:14. Putting these together, it appears that sickness and bodily infirmity and death are, within certain limits, in the power of Satan to inflict. And that the apostles were able, on fitting occasions, to hand over peccant members of the Church to this power of Satan, that by such discipline \"the spirit might be saved.\" In the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander (as in that of the incestuous person at Corinth), the punishment incident on this delivery to Satan would appear to have been short or' death, but in the case of the two first not to have had the effect of bringing them to a true repentance. Might be taught (παιδευθῶσι); viz. by correction and punishment, as children are taught (Hebrews 12:6-8). The metaphor in the word κολαφίζειν (2 Corinthians 12:7) is similar.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Tim.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - First of all, that for that, first of all, A.V.; thanksgivings for and giving of thanks. A.V. I exhort therefore. The insertion of the connecting particle \"therefore\" marks that this arrangement of Church prayers is a part - as the following words, first of all, mark that it is the first part - of that charge or administration which was now committed to Timothy. Supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings (see the Prayer for the Church Militant). The question naturally arises whether the first words here used - δεήσις προσευχάς, and ἐντεύξεις - have any distinctive meaning, or are merely accumulated, like synonyms m legal documents, or various phrases in rhetorical addresses, to ensure completeness and to add force. It is against the notion of any distinctive meaning attaching to them that no such distinction can be supported by actual use. In Philippians 4:6 two of the words (προσευχή and δέησις) are used in conjunction as here with εὐχαριστία, with no apparent difference, both being the way of making known their requests to God (so also Ephesians 6:18 and 1 Timothy 5:5). Again, in the ancient Liturgies, the words δεέσθαι and προσεύχεσθαι are constantly used of the same praying. It may, however, perhaps be said that every δέησις is a προσευχή, though every προσευχή is not a δέησις. The δέησις is a \"petition\" - a distinct asking something of God, which a προσευχή need not necessarily be. It may be merely an act of adoration, of confession, of recital of God's mercies, and so on. So as regards ἐντεύξεις, here rendered \"intercessions.\" There is nothing in the etymology/ or in the use of this word, which only occurs elsewhere in the New Testament in 1 Timothy 4:5, to limit the meaning of it to \"intercession.\" Nor has it this meaning in the passage where it occurs in the Liturgy of St. Clement, near the close, where God is addressed as Ὁ καὶ τῶν σιωπώντων ἐπιστάμενος τὰς ἐντεύξεις, \"Who understandest the petitions even of those who are silent.\" In 2 Macc. 4:8 and Diod. Sic., 16:55 it seems to mean \"a request preferred in a personal interview,\" which is an extension of its common meaning in classical Greek of \"access,\" \"an interview,\" \"social intercourse,\" or the like. But when we turn to the use of the verb ἐντυγχάνω in the New Testament, we seem to get the idea of \"intercession.\" Αντυγχάνειν is to go to someone to ask him to take action against or in favor of some third party (see Acts 25:24; Romans 11:2; Romans 8:27, 28, 34; Hebrews 7:25); and so Chrysostom (quoted in Steph., 'Thesaur.') explains ἐντυχία to be the action of one who applies to God to avenge him of those who have done him wrong. So that perhaps \"intercessions\" is, on the whole, the best rendering here, though an imperfect one; and would comprise the prayers for the emperor, for the Church, for the sick, travelers, slaves, captives, etc., for the bishops, clergy, and laity, etc., and such prayers as \"Turn away from us every plot (ἐπιβουλήν) of wicked men\" (Liturgy of St. Mark).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And all for and for all, A.V.; high place for authority, A.V.; tranquil and quiet for quiet and peaceable, A.V.; gravity for honesty, A.V. For kings, etc. The early Liturgies closely followed these directions. \"Every day, both in the evening and the morning, we offer prayers for the whole world, for kings, and for all in authority\" (Chrysost., in lee.). So in the Liturgy of St. Mark: \"Preserve our king in peace, in virtue, and righteousness.... Subdue his enemies under him... incline him to peace towards us and towards thy Holy Name, that in the serenity of his reign we too may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty [or, 'gravity'].\" In the Liturgy of St. Clement: \"Let us pray for kings and those in authority, that they may be peaceably inclined toward us, and that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all piety and honesty [or, 'gravity'].\" In the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom: \"Let us pray for our most religious and God-protected emperors, and all their palace and court.\" \"We offer this our reasonable service on behalf of our most faithful and Christian (φιλοχρίστων) emperors, and all their palace and court.\" And in the Liturgy of St. Basil: \"Remember, Lord, our most religious and faithful kings... that in their serenity we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. Remember, O Lord, all rulers and all in authority, and all our brethren in the palace, and the whole court.\" In high place (ἐν ὑπεροχῇ); elsewhere only in 1 Corinthians 2:1, where it is rendered \"excellency.\" But in Romans 13:1 we have ἐξουσίαις ὑπερεχούσαις \"the higher powers;\" and in 1 Peter 2:13, τῷ βασιλεῖ ὡς ὑπερέχοντι, \"the king as supreme.\" In 2 Macc. 3:11 the phrase, ἀνδρὸς ἐν ὑπεροχῇ κειμένου, occurs; and in Polybius, οἱ ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὔντες It is often used in Polybius for \"authority\" or \"power.\" That we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity. The prayer for the rulers is recommended (as was explained in the above extracts from the Liturgies) in order to obtain for Christians a tranquil life, undisturbed by persecution and molestation, in spite of their peculiar way of life. Their wish was to be allowed to live in the faith and obedience of the gospel, \"in godliness and gravity,\" without being interfered with by the heathen magistrates. The clause in the Prayer for the Church Militant which corresponds to this is \"that under her we may be godly and quietly governed.\" Tranquil (ἤρεμος); found only here in the New Testament. The derivatives, ἠρέμιος ἠρεμέω, etc., are common in the LXX. They all apply to a still, undisturbed, life. Quiet (ἡσύχιος); found only here and l Peter 3:4 in the New Testament, and in the LXX. in Isaiah 66:2. But the noun ἡσυχία and the verb ἡσυχάζειν are common. Godliness (εὐσεβεία). One of the words almost peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 3:16; 1 Timothy 4:7, 8; 1 Timothy 6:3, 5, 6, 11; 2 Timothy 3:5; Titus 1:1); but elsewhere only in Acts 3:12; 2 Peter 1:3, 6, 7; 2 Peter 3:11. Cornelius was αυησεβής, and so was one of the soldiers who waited upon him (Acts 10:2, 7). Ananias was ἀνὴρ εὐσεβής (Acts 22:12, T.R.). The adverb εὐσεβῶς is also peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (2 Timothy fit. 12; Titus 2:12). Gravity (σεμνοτής): so rendered also in the A.V. of 1 Timothy 3:4 and Titus 2:7 - the only other places in the New Testament where it is found. So also the adjective σεμνός (1 Timothy 3:8, 11; Titus 2:2). Elsewhere in the New Testament only in Philippians 4:8, where it is rendered\" honest\" in the A.V., and \"honorable\" in the R.V. In classical Greek σεμνός is properly spoken of the gods, \"august,\" \"venerable,\" and, when applied to persons, indicates a similar quality. Here σεμνοτής is the respectable, venerable, and dignified sobriety of a truly godly man.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This for for this, A.V. and T.R.

The verb ἀποδέχομαι, to receive gladly, is frequently used by St. Luke (Luke 8:10; Acts 2:41, where see note; etc.). God our Savior (see 1 Timothy 1:1 and Luke 1:47; Titus 1:3; Titus 2:10, 13 (perhaps); 3:4; 2 Peter 1:1 (perhaps); Jude 1:25, by which it appears that the phrase is confined to the pastoral among St. Paul's Epistles).

For this is good and acceptable in the sight of the one God, who is the God of all the nations of the earth. And God wills that all should come to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, because Jesus Christ is the One Mediator between God and all men, by whom alone men can come to the Father, and who gave himself a ransom for all. One Mediator. The term μεσίτης ισ only applied to our Savior in the New Testament here and in Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:15: 12:24. In the only other passage where St. Paul uses it (Galatians 3:19, 20) it is applied to Moses the media-tar of the Old Testament. In the LXX. it only occurs in Job 9:33. Himself man. Surely an infelicitous and unnecessary change from the A.V. Even supposing that the exact construction of the sentence requires \"Christ Jesus\" to be taken as the subject and \"man\" as the predicate, the English way of expressing that sense is to say, \"the man Christ Jesus.\" But it is very far from certain that ἄνθρωπος, standing as it does in opposition to Θεός, is not the subject, and must not therefore be rendered \"the man.\" The man. The human nature of our Lord is here insisted upon, to show how fit he is to mediate for man, as his Godhead fits him to mediate with God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The testimony to be borne in its own times for to be testified in due time, A.V. Τὸ μαρτύριον καιροῖς ἰδιοις. This phrase is somewhat obscure, and is differently explained. But the most literal rendering and the best sense seems to be: \" The testimony, at its proper time, to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle,\" meaning that the mediation and redemption of Jesus Christ was the subject-matter of that testimony which he Paul was appointed to bear at the proper time. Τὸ μαρτύριον εἰς ο{ must be taken together, without any intervening stop. This accounts for the article τό. The exactly parallel place is Titus 1:1, 2, as a close comparison of the two passages will show. A further proof of the identity of thought in the two passage's is the recurrence in both of the phrase, ἐπιγνωσις ἀληθείας. A ransom (ἀντίλυτρον); here only in the New Testament, but it is used perhaps by Symmachus in Psalm 48:9 (Psalms 49:9, A.V.), where the LXX, have Γὴν τιμὴν τῆς λυτρώσεως τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, following the reading יְקַר, instead of יֵקַר as in the Hebrew text. \"What means a ransom? They were about to perish, but in their stead he gave his Son, and sent us as heralds to proclaim the cross\" (Chrysostom). The equivalent word in the Gospels is ἀντάλλαγμα (Matthew 16:26; Mark 8:87). Ἀντίλυτρον does at seem to differ materially in me, ulna from λύτρον, the common classical word for \"ransom\" (i.e. redemption money), and used by our Lord of his own life given as a ransom for many (Matthew 20:28; Mark 10:45). It is the price given as an equivalent for setting free the prisoner, or sparing the forfeited life; λυτρόω (Luke 24:21, etc.), λύτρωσις (Luke 1:68, etc.), λυτρωτής (Acts 7:35), ἀπολύτρωσις (Luke 21:28; Romans 3:24, and passim), have all the sense of \"redeem,\" \"redemption,\" and the like. In its own times. The notion of a time specially appointed for Christ's coming into the world is frequently dwelt upon in Scripture; e.g., Galatians 4:4; Ephesians 1:10; Hebrews 1:2 (camp. Acts 17:30, 31; 2 Corinthians 6:2). (See the same phrase, 1 Timothy 6:15.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Was appointed for am ordained, A.V.; truth for truth in Christ, A.V. and T.R.; I lie for and lie, A.V.; truth for verity, A.V.

A preacher (κήρυξ; as in 2 Timothy 1:11). So Mark 16:15, \"Preach the gospel\" is Κηρύξατε τὸ εὐαγγέλιον; and in ver. 20, \"They... preached everywhere\" is 'Ακήρυξαν πανταχοῦ; and 2 Timothy 4:2, \"Preach the word\" is Κήρυξον τὸν λόγον; and generally it is the word rendered \"preach.\" It combines the idea of authority in the preacher who is the authorized herald (Romans 10:15), and publicity for his message (Matthew 10:27; Luke 12:3). I speak the truth, etc. The reason for this strong asseveration of his office as the apostle of the Gentiles is not at first sight apparent. But it was probably made in view of the antagonism of the Judaizing teachers referred to in 1 Timothy 1:3, 19, 20 (comp. Romans 11:13; Romans 15:15, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Desire for will, A.V.; the men for men, A.V.; in every place for everywhere, A.V.; disputing for doubting, A.V.

The stress is clearly upon \"men\" (or, \"the men\" - it makes no difference); and there is no force in Alford's remark that in that case it would have been τοὺς ἄνδρας προσεύχεσθαι. The prayers had been already ordered in ver. 1; the additional detail, that they were to be offered by men, is now added. In every place; not, as Chrysostom thinks, in contrast to the Jewish worship, which was confined to the temple at Jerusalem, but merely meaning wherever a Christian congregation is assembled. Lifting up holy hands. Alford quotes Clem. Ram. 'To the Corinthians,' Ep. 1. 1 Timothy 29: Προσέλθωμεν... ἐν ὁσιότητι ψυχῆς ἁγνὰς καὶ ἀμιάντους χεῖρας αἴρουντες πρὸς αὐτόν (camp. Psalm 26:6; Psalm 28:2; 43:20; 63:4; 2 Chronicles 6:12, 13). Without wrath. It appears from several passages in Chrysostom that the habit of praying angry prayers was not unknown in his day. \"Do you pray against your brother? But your prayer is not against him, but against yourself. You provoke God by uttering those impious words, 'Show him the same;' 'So do to him;' 'Smite him;' 'Recompense him;' and much more to the same effect\" ('Hom.' 6.). In 'Hom.' 8. his comment on this passage is: \"Without bearing malice.... Let no one approach each God in enmity, or in an unsalable temper.\" And disputing (διαλογισμοῦ). The exact meaning of διαλογισμός is perhaps best seen in Luke 5:21, 22, where both the verb and the substantive are used. The διαλογισμοὶ are carillings, questionings proceeding from a captious, unbelieving spirit. They are διαλογισμοὶ πονηροὶ (Matthew 15:19). The word is always used in a bad sense in the New Testament. Forms of prayer were not yet established in the Church, but these cautious show the need of them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - In like manner for in like manner also, A.V. and T.R.; braided for broided, A.V.; and gold for or gold, A.V.; raiment for array, A.V. The apostle here passes on to the duties of women as members of the congregation, and he places first modesty of demeanor and dress, the contrary to these being likely to prove a hurt and a hindrance to their fellow-worshippers. Adorn themselves in modest apparel. This is obviously the true construction, κοσμεῖν depending upon βούλομαι. There is a little doubt as to the exact meaning of καταστολή here, the only place where it occurs in the New Testament. Alford argues strongly in favor of the meaning \"apparel.\" But it may also mean \"steadiness\" or \"quietness\" of demeanor; and then the phrase will be exactly parallel to 1 Peter 3:5, \"The incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit.\" And the meaning will be, \"Let Christian women adorn themselves with a decent and well-ordered quietness of demeanor, in strict accordance with [or, 'together with'] shame-fastness and sobriety [μετά, 'in strict accord with,' or 'together with'] not with braided hair,\" etc. A woman's true ornament is not the finery which sire gets from the milliner, but the chaste discretion which she has from the Spirit of God. Modest (κόσμιος); only found in the New Testament here and in 1 Timothy 3:2, where it is rendered\" of good behavior\" in the A.V., and \"modest\" in the margin, \"orderly\" in the R.V. It is common in classical Greek in the sense of \"welt-ordered,\" \"welt-behaved.\" Shamefastness (αἰδώς, bashfulness). So the edition of 1611; \"shamefacedness\" in the later editions is a corruption. Archbishop Trench compares \"stead fast,\" \"soothfast,\" \"root fast,\" \"master-fast,\" \"footfast,\" \"bedfast,\" with their substantives ('Synonyms of New Test.,' § 20.). Sobriety (σωφροσύνη, as in ver. 15, q.v.); soundness, health, purity, and integrity of mind. 'Απὸ τοῦ σώας τὰς φρένας ἔχειν (Chrysostom, 'Ap. Trench.'). Braided hair (πλέγμασιν); found only here in the New Testament, but used in Aquila and Theodotion, instead of the πλεκείς ορ πλακείς of the LXX., in Isaiah 28:5, for צְפִירָה, a \"diadem,\" or \"twined garland.\" In classical Greek πλέγματα are anything twined, tendrils of the vine, wickerwork, chaplets, etc. The corresponding word in 1 Peter 3:3 is ἐμπλοκὴ τριχῶν, \"plaiting the hair.\" Costly raiment (ἱματισμῷ πολυτελεῖ). For ἱματισμὸς, comp. Luke 7:25; Luke 9:23; Acts 20:33; Psalm 45:10, LXX.; etc., which show tinct the word is used κατ ἐξοχήν of any splendid garment (Schleusuer). Πολυτελής, costly (see Mark 14:3; 1 Peter 3:4, and frequently in the LXX.). St. Peter manifestly had this passage before him from the marked verbal coincidences, as well as close similarity of thought (ἐμπλοκή χρύσιον κόσμος ἱμάτιον, πολυτελής ἀγαθοποιοῦσαι (compared with δι ἔργων ἀγαθῶν), ἡσυχία ὑποταγή, (compared with ὑποτασσόμεναι), ἁγαίαι γυναῖκες κ.τ.λ.

(The change from \"with\" to \"through\" is quite unnecessary, though more strictly accurate. \"With\" does equally well for ἐν and διά, the one applied to the ornaments and dress in or with which the woman adorns herself, the other to the good works by which she is adorned.) Professing godliness. In all ether passages in the New Testament where it occurs, ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι means \"to promise,\" except in 1 Timothy 6:21, where, as here, it means \"to profess,\" as it frequently does in classical Greek: Απαγγέλλεσθαι ἀρετήν σοφίαν, etc. Θεοσεβεία only occurs here in the New Testament; but it is used in the LXX. in Job 28:28; Genesis 20:11; also in Xenophon. In John 9:31 we have Θεοσεβής, \"a worshipper of God.\" Through good works. Compare the description of Dorcas (Acts 9:36, 39). Ἔργα ἀγαθά mean especially acts of charity (comp. 1 Timothy 5:10; 2 Corinthians 9:8, 9; Colossians 1:11; elsewhere it is us, d more generally, like ἔργα καλά, though this phrase also sometimes points especially to acts of charity, as in 1 Timothy 5:10; 1 Timothy 6:18; Titus 3:14; Hebrews 10:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the woman learn in silence with all subjection.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A for the, A.V.; quietness for silence, A.V. Quietness is not so good a rendering as \"silence,\" because the quietness here meant is silence, as appears clearly by the parallel direction in 1 Corinthians 14:34. So Acts 22:2, παρέσχον ἡσουχίαν is properly rend red in the A.V., \"They kept silence.\" And ἡσύχασαν (Luke 14:4 and Acts 11:18) is read, red, both in the A.V. and the R.V., \"They held their peace.\" With all subjection (ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ); as 1 Timothy 3:4. The words occur also in 2 Corinthians 9:13; Galatians 2:5. But the verb ὑποτάσσομαι is very common in the sense of \"being subject.\" It is used of the subjection of the wife to her husband (1 Corinthians 14:34; Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18; Titus 2:5; 1 Peter 3:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Permit for suffer, A.V.; have dominion for usurp authority, A.V.; a for the, A.V.; quietness for silence, A.V. Permit. Why \"permit\" is better than \"suffer\" it is difficult to see. Ἐπιτρέπειν is rendered \"suffer\" in the R.V. in Matthew 8:21; Matthew 19:8; Mark 10:4; Luke 9:59, etc. Quietness (see preceding note). The true type of the womanly attitude is that of Mary, who \"sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his Word\" (Luke 10:39).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Adam was first formed, then Eve.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Was formed (ἐπλάσθη). The word used in the LXX. in Genesis 2:7, Ἔπλασεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον κ.τ.λ., \"The Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground;\" and in Genesis 2:19 of the beasts of the field; whence the word πρωτόπλαστος (Wisd. 7:1 Wisd. 10:1), \"first made;\" \"first formed,\" A.V. So in Romans 9:20 man is called τὸ πλάσμα, \"the thing made;\" and God is ὁ Πλάσας, \"he that made it.\" \"Plaster,\" \"plastic,\" \"protoplasm,\" are, of course, from the same root. (For the argument, see the very similar one in 1 Corinthians 11:8, 9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Beguiled (twice) for deceived, A.V.; hath fallen into for was in the, A.V. Beguiled (ἠπατήθη). The same word as is used in Genesis 3:13, \"The serpent beguiled me;\" ἠπάτησέ με, LXX. (comp. 2 Corinthians 11:3, where the verb used is ἐξηπάτησεν). Hath fallen into transgression. Fell (not hath fallen) is the right tense to use here in English, though the Greek perfect, it is true, contains the further idea of continuance in the fall, as in 1 Corinthians 9:22; 1 Corinthians 13:11; 1 Thessalonians 2:1; 2 Peter 2:20. So also Matthew 1:22; Matthew 19:8; Matthew 21:4; Matthew 25:6; Mark 5:33; John 1:3; 2 Corinthians 1:19; and elsewhere, γέγονε is best rendered by the past (not the perfect) tense. It has frequently the notion of transition into a certain condition (see Romans 6:5; Romans 7:13; 1 Corinthians 9:22; 1 Corinthians 13:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17; 2 Corinthians 12:11; Galatians 4:16, etc.). Bishop Ellicott gives the passages in which γίγνομαι ισ followed, as here, by ἐν (Luke 22:44; Acts 22:17; 2 Corinthians 3:7; 1 Thessalonians 2:5), \"denoting entrance into, and continuance in, any given state.\" As regards the apostle's statement, Adam was not beguiled, we must understand it as based merely upon the text in Genesis to which he refers, in which Eve (not Adam) says, Ὁ ὄφις ἠπάτησε με, \"The serpent beguiled me.\" Just as in Galatians 3:16 he reasons from σπέρματι being in the singular number, and as the writer to the Hebrews 7:3 reasons from the silence of Genesis 14. regarding the parentage of Melchizedek. Huther (in lee.) says that this mode of reasoning is peculiar to allegorical interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But for notwithstanding, A.V.; through the child-bearing for in child-bearing, A.V.; love for charity, A.V.; sanctification for holiness, A.V. She shall be saved; i.e. the woman generically. The transition from the personal Eve to the generic woman is further marked by the transition from the singular to the plural, \"if they continue,\" etc. The natural and simple explanation of the passage is that the special temporal punishment pronounced against the woman, immediately after her sin, \"In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children\" (Genesis 3:16) - (to which St. Paul here evidently alludes) - and endured by all women ever since, was a set-off, so to speak, to the special guilt of Eve in yielding to the guile of the serpent; so that now the woman might attain salvation as well as the man (although she was not suffered to teach)if she continued in faith and charity. The child-bearing (τῆς τεκνογονίας); here only; but the verb τεκνογονέω, which occurs in 1 Timothy 5:14, is found (though very rarely) in classical Greek. The equivalent, both in the LXX. and in classical Greek, is τεκνοποιέω. The reference to the birth of Christ - the Seed of the woman - which some commentators Hammond, Peile, Wordsworth, Ellicott, etc.; not Bengel, Alford. or the German school generally) see here, is rather strained, and anyhow cannot be proved without an inspired interpreter. The stress which is laid by some of the above on the use of the definite article here has no justification (see e.g., 2 Peter 1:5-7, where even the R.V. does not think of translating \"the virtue,\" \"the knowledge,\" \"the temperance,\" etc.). Nor is the meaning of διά, which Alford and others press, \"through,\" i.e. \"in spite of,\" like διὰ πυρός in 1 Corinthians 3:15, at all probable from the context. Sanctification (ἀγιασμός; Romans 6:19; 1 Thessalonians 4:3, etc.). Sobriety (σωφροσύνη); as in ver. 9. It only occurs besides in Acts 26:25.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Tim.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Faithful is the saying for this is a true saying, A.V.; seeketh for desire, A.V. Faithful is the saying (see above, 1 Timothy 1:15, note). This manifestly refers to what follows, not, as Chrysostom and others, and margin of the R.V., to the saying which precedes, in 1 Timothy 2:15. Seeketh (ὀρέγεται); literally, stretches out his hands after. It is peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles and the Epistle to the Hebrews, though common in classical Greek (see 1 Timothy 6:10; Hebrews 11:16). The noun ὔρεξις, appetite, desire (which is found several times in the LXX.), is used once by St. Paul (Romans 1:27). The office of a bishop; meaning here, as everywhere else in Scripture, that of a presbyter, or priest. Ἐπισκοπή, in the sense of \"the episcopate,\" occurs only here and Acts 1:20, where it is rendered \"bishopric\" in the A.V., and \"overseer-ship\" in the margin of the R.V., being the translation in the LXX. of Psalm 108 (Psalms 109, A.V.) of the Hebrew פְקֻדָתו, \"his office.\" Elsewhere (Luke 19:44; 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 5:6) it means \"visitation.\" But ἐπίσκοπος, \"bishop\" (ver. 2) - except in 1 Peter 2:25, where it is applied to Christ - always means the overseer of the particular flock, - the presbyter (Acts 20:28; Philippians 1:1; Titus 1:7); and ἐπισκοπεῖν the functions of such ἐπίσκοπος (1 Peter 5:2 compared with 1). It was not till the sub-apostolic age that the name of ἐπίσ᾿οπος was confined to the chief overseer who had \"priests and deacons\" under him, as Timothy and Titus had. Possibly this application of the word arose from the visits of the apostles, and afterwards of men sent by the apostles, as Timothy and Titus, Tychicus and Artemas, were, to visit the Churches, being occasional and temporary only, as those of Visitors. For such occasional visitation is implied in the verb ἐπισκέπτεσθαι (Matthew 25:36, 43; Luke 1:68, 78; Acts 7:23; Acts 15:36; James 1:27). Afterwards, when the wants of the Churches required permanent oversight, the name ἐπίσκοπος - vescovo (It.), eueque (Fr.), bischof (Get.), bisceop (A.S.), aipiskaupus (Moeso-Goth.), etc. - became universal for the chief overseer of the Church. A good work (καλοῦ ἔργου, not ἀγαθοῦ, as ver. 10). Καλού means \"honourable,\" \"becoming,\" \"beneficial,\" and the like.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The for a, A.V.; therefore for then, A.V.; without reproach for blameless, A.V.; temperate for vigilant, A.V.; sober-minded for sober, A.V.; orderly for of good behavior, A.V. The bishop (see note on ver. 1); \"a bishop\" is better English. Without reproach (ἀνεπίληπτος); only here and 1 Timothy 5:7 and 1 Tim 6:14 in the New Testament; not found anywhere in the LXX, but used by Thucydides, Euripides, and others, in the sense of \"not open to attack,\" \"blameless.\" The metaphor is said (though denied by others)to be from wrestling or boxing, when a man leaves no part of his body exposed to the attack of his adversary. The husband of one wife (comp. Titus 1:6). Three senses are possible. The passage may be understoodNEWLINENEWLINE(1) as requiring a bishop, (or presbyter) to have a wife, and so some took it even in Chrysostom's time (though he does not so understand it), and so the Russian Church understands it;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) as prohibiting his having more than one with at a time;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) as prohibiting second marriages for priests and bishops. Bishop Wordsworth, Bishop Ellicott, and Dean Alford, among English commentators, all agree in thinking that (3) is the apostle's meaning. In spite of such consensus, it appears in the highest degree improbable that St. Paul should have laid down such a condition for the priesthood. There is nothing in his writings when treating expressly of second marriages (Romans 7:2, 3; 1 Corinthians 7:8, 39) to suggest the notion of there being anything disreputable in a second marriage, and it would obviously cast a great slur upon second marriages if it were laid down as a principle that no one who had married twice was fit to be an ἐπίσκοπος. But if we consider the general laxity in regard to marriage, and the facility of divorce, which prevailed among Jews and Romans at this time, it must have been a common thing for a man to have more than one woman living who had been his wife. And this, as a distinct breach of the primeval law (Genesis 2:24), would properly be a bar to any one being called to the \"office of a bishop.\" The same case is supposed in 1 Corinthians 7:10-13. But it is utterly unsupported by any single passage in Scripture that a second marriage should disqualify a man for the sacred ministry. As regards the opinion of the early Church, it was not at all uniform, and amongst those who held that this passage absolutely prohibits second marriages in the case of an episcopus, it was merely a part of the asceticism of the day. As a matter of course, such writers as Origen and Tertullian held it. The very early opinion that Joseph, the husband of Mary, had children by a former wife, which finds place in the Protevangelium of James (9.), is hardly consistent with the theory of the disreputableness of second marriages. In like manner, the phrase in 1 Timothy 5:9, ἐνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή, is best explained in accordance with the apostle's doctrine about the lawfulness of a woman's second marriage, as meaning that she was the husband of one man only, as long as her husband lived. (For the chief patristic opinions on the subject, see Bishop Wordsworth's note, and Bingham's 'Christian Antiquities,' bk. 4. 1 Timothy 5.) Temperate (νηφάλιον); peculiar to the pastoral Epistles (see ver. 11 and Titus 2:2), but found in classical Greek. The verb νήφειν means \"to be sober\" (1 Thessalonians 5:6; 2 Timothy 4:5; 1 Peter 1:13; 1 Peter 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8). It denotes that temperate use of meat and drink which keeps the mind watchful and on the alert, and then the state of mind itself so produced. The opposite state of mind is described in Luke 21:34. Sober-minded (σώφρονα); in the New Testament only here and in Titus 1:8; Titus 2:2, 5. But σωφρονέω is found in the Gospels and Epistles; σωφρονίζω σωφρονισμός σωφρόνως, in the pastoral Epistles; and σωφροσύνη in 1 Timothy 2:15 (where see note). Orderly (κόσμιον; see 1 Timothy 2:9, note). Given to hospitality (φιλόξενον; as Titus 1:8 and 1 Peter 4:9). The substantive φιλοξενία is found in Romans 12:13; Hebrews 13:2. Apt to teach (διδακτικόν); only here and 2 Timothy 2:24, and Philo, 'De Proem. et Virt.,' 4 (Huther). The classical word is διδασκαλικός, though chiefly applied to things. In the above-quoted passage in 1 Peter 4. the gifts of speaking and ministering are, as here, placed alongside that of hospitality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - No brawler for not given to wine, A.V.; the R.T. omits the clause μὴ αἰσξρερδη; gentle for patient, A.V.; contentious for a brawler, A.V.; no lover of money, for not covetous, A.V. No brawler (μὴ πάροινον); only here and Titus 1:7; but, as well as παροίνιος, common in classical Greek, in the sense of \"quarrelsome over wine.\" In Matthew 11:19 and Luke 7:34 \"wine-bibber\" is οἰνοπότης. In 1 Peter 4:3 the word for \"excess of wine\" is οἰνοφλυγία. No striker (μὴ τλήκτην); only here and Titus 1:7. It is used, though rarely, in classical Greek for a \"striker,\" \"brawler.\" There is but weak manuscript authority for the reading in the T.R., μὴ αἰσχροκερδῆ, not given to filthy lucre, which is thought to have been derived from Titus 1:7 (q.v.). The internal evidence, however, is in its favor, as something is wanted to correspond to ἀφιλάργυρον, just as πάροινον and πλήκτην correspond to ἐπιεικῆ and at, ἄμαχον respectively. Gentle (ἐπιεικῆ); as Titus 3:2. So also it is rendered in the A.V. of James 3:17; 1 Peter 2:18. It is very common in classical Greek, in the sense of \"fair,\" \"meet,\" \"suitable,\" of things; and of \"fair,\" \"kind,\" \"gentle,\" of persons. The substantive ἐπιεικεία means \"clemency,\" \"gentleness,\" (Acts 24:4; 2 Corinthians 10:1). Not contentious (ἄμαχον); only here and Titus 3:3 in the New Testament, and in Ecclus. 19:5 in the Complutensian edition. It is also used in this sense in AEschylus, 'Persse,' 955, though its more common meaning in classical Greek is \"invincible.\" No lover of money (ἀφιλάργυρον); only here and Hebrews 13:5. Ἁφιλαργυρία occurs in Hippocrates. The positive φιλάργυρος, φιλαργυρία, occurs in 1 Timothy 6:10; 2 Timothy 3:2; Luke 16:14. Neither the A.V. nor the R.V. quite preserves the form of the original sentence, where the three negative qualities (μὴ πάροινον μὴ πλήκτην μὴ αἰσχροκερδῆ, T.R.) are followed by three positive qualities (ἐπιοικῆ ἄμαχον ἀφιλάργυρον - \"gentle,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"indifferent about money\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - One that ruleth well his own house. The ἐπίσκοπος is one who has to preside over and rule (προίστασθαι) the house of God (1 Timothy 5:17; Romans 12:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:12), as the high priest was called \"ruler of the house of God\" (1 Chronicles 9:11; Nehemiah 11:11). So in Justin Martyr the bishop is called ὁ προεστῶς τῶν ἀδελφῶν ('Apology,' 11) and simply ὁ προεστῶς, and similarly in Hebrews 13:7 the clergy are οἱ ἡγούμενοι ὑμῶν, \"they which have the rule over you.\" How needful, then, is it that he should rule well his own house, and have his own children in subjection! The testimony given in this passage to a married clergy is too clear to need any comment. In subjection (ἐν ὑποταγῇ); as above, 1 Timothy 2:11, where see note. For the sense, comp. Titus 1:6, which leads us to apply the words, with all gravity (σεμνότητος), the contrary to \"riot,\" ἀσωτία), to the children. The children of the ἐπίσκοπος are to exhibit that seriousness and sobriety of conduct which is in accordance with their father's office, μετά, together with, as in 1 Timothy 1:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But for for, A.V., knoweth for know, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. Puffed up for lifted up with pride, A.V. A novice (νεόφυτον); only here in the New Testament, but found repeatedly in the LXX. in its literal sense of \"a tree\" or \"plantation\" newly planted (Psalm 127:3 (Psalms 128:3, A.V.); 144:12; Isaiah 5:7). Here the novice or neophyte is one recently converted and received into the Church (comp. 1 Corinthians 3:6; Isaiah 61:3). As such he is not yet fit to be a ruler and a teacher of the brethren. The reason follows. Lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil. Τυφωθεις, puffed up, is peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 3:4), from τυφός, smoke (comp. λίνον τυφόμενον, \"smoking flax,\" Matthew 12:10). The idea seems to be \"lightness,\" \"emptiness,\" and \"elation.\" Some add that of \"obscuration\" as by smoke; τυφόω, to wrap in smoke; τετύφωμαι, to be wrapt in clouds of conceit and folly (Liddell and Scott). The condemnation of the devil. A somewhat obscure phrase. It means eitherNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the same condemnation as that into which the devil fell through pride, - and so Chrysostom, Olshausen, Bishop Ellicott, Wordsworth, Alford, etc., take it; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the condemnation or accusation of the devil. In the latter case κρῖμα would be used in the same sense as κρίσις in Jude 1:9, and would mean the charge preferred against him by \"the accuser of the brethren\" (comp. Job 1:9; Job 2:4, 5). One of the senses of κρίνω is \"to accuse\" - like κατηγορεῖν (Liddell and Scott). And this view agrees with ὀνειδισμὸν καὶ παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου in ver. 7, which means, not the trap into which the devil fell, but the trap laid by the devil. It remains doubtful which is the true sense, butNEWLINENEWLINE(2) seems, on the whole, the most probable. The devil (τοῦ διαβόλου) can only mean Satan (Matthew 4:1; Matthew 13:39, etc.), though possibly conceived of as speaking by the mouth of traducers and vilifiers of the Church, as in ver. 7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Good testimony from for a good report of, A.V.; that for which, A.V. Good testimony (μαρτυρίαν καλήν; see 1 Timothy 5:10). So it is said of Timothy himself that ἐμαρτυρεῖτο, \"he was well reported of by the brethren\" (Acts 16:2). In accordance with this rule, letters testimonial are required of all persons to be ordained, to the importance of character in a clergyman (comp. 2 Corinthians 6:3). Them that are without (τῶν ἔξωθεν); used in Matthew 23:27; Luke 11:39; 1 Peter 3:3; Revelation 11:2, etc., of that; which is outside or external literally, as the outside of the cup, the outer ornament of the body, the outside of the sepulcher, the outer court of the temple. It is synonymous with the more common form, ἔξω. (For the phrase, \"they that are without\" (οἱ ἔξω), as applied to those who are not members of the Church, see Mark 4:11; John 9:34, 35; 1 Corinthians 5:12, 13; Colossians 4:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:12.) The opposite is ἔσω ἔσωθεν (1 Corinthians 5:12; Matthew 23:25, etc.). So exoteric and esoteric, of doctrines intended respectively for the outside world or the inner circle of disciples. Reproach (ὀνειδισμόν); the reproaches and revilings cast upon him by unbelievers (Romans 15:3; Hebrews 10:33; Hebrews 11:26; Hebrews 13:13). The verb ὀνειδίζειν has the same sense (1 Timothy 4:10; Matthew 5:11; Mark 15:32; Luke 6:22; 1 Peter 4:14), and so in classical Greek. This reproach is further described as the snare of the devil (comp. 1 Timothy 6:9; 2 Timothy 2:26), because it is through these revilings that the devil seeks to impair the power of his ministry and frighten him from the exercise of it. The genitive τοῦ διαβόλου depends only upon πασίδα, not upon ὀνειδισμόν. The καὶ does not indicate that there are two separate things into which he falls, but adds, as a description of the ὀνειδισμός, that it is \"a snare of the devil.\" The idea in 1 Peter 5:8 is analogous. There it is by afflictions that the devil seeks to devour the disciple who is weak in faith. Those afflictions might well be described as παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου,\" a snare of the devil,\" set for weak souls.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Deacons in like manner must for likewise must the deacons, A.V. Grave (σεμνούς); in Philippians 4:8 rendered \"honest\" in the A.V., and \"honourable\" in the R.V., and \"venerable\" in the margin. None of the words are satisfactory, but \"honest\" in the sense of honnete, i.e. \"respectable,\" \"becoming the dignity of a man,\" comes nearest to the meaning of σεμνός. Ἄνηρ σεμνός is a man who inspires respect by his conduct and deportment. It occurs again in ver. 11 and in Titus 2:2. Double-tongued (διλόγους); only here in the New Testament, or indeed anywhere. The verb διλογεῖν and the noun διλογία are found in Xenophon and Diodorus Siculus, but in a different sense - \"to repeat,\" \"repetition.\" Here δίλογος is used in the sense of δίγλωσσος (Proverbs 11:13; Ecclus. 28:13), \"a slanderer,\" \"a false-tongued man,\" who, as Theophylact (ap. Schleusner) well explains it, thinks one thing and says another, and says different things to different people. The caution here given is of incalculable importance to young curates. They must not allow themselves to be either receptacles or vehicles of scandal and detraction. Their speech to rich and poor alike must be perfectly sincere and ingenuous. Not given to much wine. The effect of the best sermon may be undone, and more than undone, if the preacher sinks into the pot-companion of his hearers. He at once ceases to be σεμνός, to inspire respect (comp. Titus 2:3 where the additional idea, most true, of the slavery of drunkards, is introduced). Greedy of filthy lucre (αἰσχροκερδεῖς); only here and in ver. 3 (T.R.) and Titus 1:7. The adverb αἰσχροκερδῶς occurs in 1 Peter 5:2, and is one of many points of resemblance between the pastoral Epistles and 1 Peter. Balsam, Gehazi, and Judas Iscariot are the three prominent examples of professed servants of God being lovers of filthy lucre. Achan (Joshua 7:21) is another (see 1 Timothy 6:10). When lucre is the price for doing wrong, it is \"filthy.\" When lucre is sought on occasions where none is due, it is \"filthy;\" and when the desire of even just gains is excessive, it ceases to be clean.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHolding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. Μυστήριον, a mystery, is that which, having been long hidden, is at length disclosed, either to men generally or to elect disciples. It is derived from μυέω, to initiate, of which the passive μυέομαι, to be instructed or initiated, is found in Philippians 4:12, and is common in classical Greek, being itself derived from μύω, \"to close the lips as in pronouncing the syllable μῦ,\" whence also taurus. The idea is of something secret, which might not be spoken cf. In the New Testament we have \"the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 13:11; Luke 8:10; Mark 4:11); and St. Paul brings out the full force of the word when he speaks (Romans 16:25) of \"the mystery which was kept secret (σεσιγημένου) since the world began... but is now made known to all nations for the obedience of faith\" (see too Ephesians 3:3-6; Colossians 2:26, etc.). \"The faith\" is equivalent to \"the gospel,\" or \"the kingdom of heaven,\" or the \"godliness\" of ver. 16 (where see note); and \"the mystery of the faith\" might be paraphrased by \"the revealed truth of Christianity\". What is added, \"in a pure conscience,\" teaches us that orthodoxy without personal holiness is little worth. Holding \"the truth in unrighteousness\" is severely condemned by St. Paul (Romans 1:18). He says of himself (Acts 23:1), \"I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day\" (comp. Acts 24:16; 2 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Timothy 1:5, 19, etc.). It is much to be observed how St. Paul, the great teacher of the doctrine of g-race, lays constant stress upon the functions of the conscience, and the necessity of having a pure conscience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. Serve as deacons for use the office of a deacon, A.V.; if they be for being found, A.V. And let these also, etc. There is an ambiguity in the English here. It is not\" these also\" - these in addition to others, i.e. the bishops before named - but \"these be also first proved.\" Their general character, as described in vers. 8, 9, must not be taken upon loose hearsay, but must be put to the test by examination, by special testimony, by inquiry, and then, if they are ἀνέγκλητοι, not accused, not open to just blame, blameless, let them be admitted to serve as deacons (see ver. 13, note). The Church of England scrupulously acts up to these directions by requiring written testimonials, by personal inquiries made by the bishop, by the Si quis, by the appeal to the congregation in the Ordination Service, \"Brethren, if there be any of you who knoweth any impediment, or notable crime, in any of these persons presented to be ordained deacons, for the which he ought not to be admitted to that office, let him come forth in the name of God, and show what the crime or impediment is;\" as well as by the careful examination of the candidates. Blameless (comp. Titus 1:6, 7); ἀνέγκλητος, rendered in the Vulgate nullum crimen habentes (which seems to explain the \"notable crime\" of the Ordination Service), and in Colossians 1:22 \"unreprovable\" both in the A.V. and the R.V. The whole passage, from ver. 2 to ver. 13, shows the supreme importance of a holy and blameless conversation in the clergy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Women in like maturer must for even so must their wives, A.V.; temperate for sober, A.V.

The choice lies betweenNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the wives of the deacons, as in the A.V.;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the wives of the episcopi and deacons;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) deaconesses.NEWLINENEWLINEThis last, on the whole, is the most probable. The male deacons had just been spoken of, and so the apostle goes on to speak of the female deacons (at διάκονοι, Romans 16:1). He conceives of the deacon's office as consisting of two branches -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the deacons,NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the deaconesses;NEWLINENEWLINEand gives appropriate directions for each. It must he remembered that the office of the early deacon was in a great measure secular, so that there is nothing strange in that of the deaconess being coupled with it. The retrain in ver. 12 to the male deacon is in favor of understanding \"the women\" of the deaconesses, as showing that the subject of the diaconate was not done with. Chrysostom (who says, \"He is speaking of those who hold the rank of deaconesses\") and all the ancient commentators, and De Wette, Wiesinger, Wordsworth, Alford, and Ellicott among the moderns, so understand it (see following notes). Grave (σεμνὰς; see ver. 8, note). Not slanderers (μὴ διαβόλους, corresponding to the μὴ διλόγους of ver. 8). This use of διάβολος, which is the classical one, is peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (see 2 Timothy 3:3; Titus 2:3). Temperate (νηφαλίους; see ver. 2, note). It corresponds here to the μὴ οἴνῳ πολλῷ προσέχοντας of ver. 8. Faithful in all things (πιστὰς ἐν πᾶδιν). This seems to refer specially to their being the almoners of the Church charities, and so favors the explanation of \"women\" as meaning deaconesses. Πιστός means especially \"trusty\" (Matthew 24:45; Matthew 25:21; Luke 12:42; Luke 16:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Deacons for the deacons, A.V.; husbands for the husbands, A.V.

In Romans 12:8 and 1 Thessalonians 5:12 it is applied to the spiritual ruler, the ἐπίσκοπος or πρεσβυτερος of the Church. Elsewhere only in the pastoral Epistles (above, vers. 4 and 5; 1 Timothy 5:17; Titus 3:8, 14).

Served... as deacons (διακονήσαντες); as in ver. 10. In this technical sense only found in these two passages; which well agrees with the late date of this Epistle, when the technical sense of διάκονος was established. Gain to themselves a good standing. The sense of the passage depends a good deal upon the exact meaning of βαθμός. In 1 Samuel 5:4, 5, in the LXX., βαθμός is the rendering of מִפְתָּן (rendered αἴθριον in Ezekiel 9:3; Ezekiel 10:4), a somewhat unusual word for a \"threshold.\" In 2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11, it is the rendering of מַעֲלָה, \"a degree on the sun-dial.\" This latter seems to suit better the verb περιποιοῦνται, they gain or acquire, which suggests the idea of advancement. It does not follow that St. Paul had in his mind their advancement from the \"inferior office\" to \"the higher ministries in the Church\" (Ordination Service); he may merely have meant to say that the discharge of the duties of a deacon in an efficient and exemplary manner raised a man to high estimation in the Church, and so gave him confidence in confessing the faith of Jesus Christ both by word and deed. Gain to themselves (περιποιοῦνται); acquire by purchase or otherwise. Frequent in the LXX.; but only elsewhere in the New Testament in Acts 20:28. Boldness (παρρησίαν); very common in the New Testament (comp. Acts 4:13, 29, 31; Ephesians 6:19; Philippians 1:20, etc.), where it is especially applied to boldness in preaching the gospel of Christ. This seems to imply that St. Paul contemplated preaching as a part of the deacon's work. We know that Philip the deacon and Stephen the deacon were both preachers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - To come unto thee; to Ephesus, where Timothy was (1 Timothy 1:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Men ought to behave themselves for thou oughtest to behave thyself, A.V. To behave thyself (ἀναστρέφεσθαι); variously rendered, both in the A.V. and the R.V., \"to have one's conversation,\" \"to live,\" \"to pass (one's time),\" \"to be used\" (Hebrews 10:33). It is literally \"to go up and down\" a given place, \"backwards and forwards,\" hence \"to dwell in it.\" The substantive ἀναστροφή, in the thirteen places where it occurs in the New Testament, is always rendered \"conversation\" in the A.V.; in the R.V., \"manner of life,\" \"life,\" \"issue of life,\" \"manner of living,\" \"behaviour,\" \"living.\" It is a favorite word in the two Epistles of St. Peter, where it occurs eight times. The house of God. This phrase here denotes, as it is explained in the following words, the Church on earth. So Hebrews 3:6, \"Christ as a Son over his house; whose house are we,\" where the reference is to Numbers 12:7, \"My servant Moses... is faithful in all mine house.\" The Church of the living God. Here is again a somewhat remarkable resemblance to the phraseology of the Epistle to the Hebrews, \"Ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God.... to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn\" (Hebrews 12:22, 23). However, the phraseology is not peculiar to the Epistle to the Hebrews. Thus we read in 2 Corinthians 6:16, \"Ye are the temple of the living God.\" The phrase, \"the living God,\" occurs seven times in St. Paul's Epistles, and four times in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It occurs three times in the Gospels, once in the Acts of the Apostles, and once in the Revelation. Here it is used by St. Paul to enhance the obligation to a holy and blameless walk in those who have the oversight of his Church. The pillar and ground of the truth. Some apply these words to Timothy himself (Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, and others cited by Alford), after the analogy of Galatians 2:9, where James, Cephas, and John are said to be \"pillars\" (στύλοι), and Revelation 3:12, where it is said of him that over-cometh, \"I will make him a pillar (στύλον) in the house of my God.\" And so, in Venantius Fortunatus, St. Paul is called \"stilus ille.\" But the metaphors of \"a pillar\" and \"a foundation\" do not all suit the verb ἀναστρέφεσθαι; and it is well argued that the absence of the pronoun σε is unfavorable to the application of \"the pillar and ground of the truth\" to the subject of the first clause. It is therefore better to understand this clause as descriptive of the Church of God. The Church is the pillar of the truth. It supports it; holds it together - binds together its different parts. And it is the ground of the truth. By it the truth is made fast, firm, and fixed. The ground (ἑδραίωμα). This word only occurs here at all; ἑδραῖος, common both in the New Testament, the LXX., and in classical Greek, means \"fixed,\" \"firm,\" or\" fast.\" In the A.V. of 1 Corinthians 7:37 and 1 Cor 15:58, \"steadfast;\" Colossians 1:23 (where it is coupled with τεθεμελιωμένα), \"settled.\" Thence ἑδραιόω in late Greek, \"to make firm or fast,\" and ἑδραίμα, the \"establishment\" or \"grounding\" of the truth; that in and by which the truth is placed on a sure and fixed basis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He who for God, A.V. and T.R.; manifested for manifest, A.V.; among the nations for unto the Gentiles, A.V.; in for into, A.V. Without controversy (ὁμολογουμένως); only here in the New Testament, but used in the same sense in the LXX. and in classical Greek, \"confessedly,\" by common confession. Great is the mystery of godliness. This is said to enhance the glory of the Church just spoken of, to whom this mystery has been entrusted, and so still further to impress upon Timothy the vital necessity of a wise and holy walk in the Church. The mystery of godliness is all that truth which \"in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.\" Godliness (τῆς εὐδεβείας); i.e.\" the Christian faith;\" what in 1 Timothy 6:3 is called \"The words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness (τῇ κατ αὐσεβείαν διδασκαλὶᾳ),\" and in 2 Timothy 1:1, \"The truth which is according to godliness.\" In ver. 9 it is \"the mystery of the faith, where ἠ πίστις is equivalent to ἡ αὐσεβεία. Bishop Ellicott, however, does not admit this objective sense of ἡ πίστις ορ ἡ αὐσεβεία but explains the genitive as \"a pure possessive genitive,\" the mystery appertaining to, or the property of, subjective faith and godliness; but this is a use not borne out b- any passage in which the word \"mystery\" occurs. It is always mysteries (or mystery) of the kingdom of God, of Christ, of God, of the gospel, and the like. In the following passages the objective sense of ἠ πίστις is either necessary or by far the most natural: Acts 3:7; Acts 13:8; Acts 14:22; Acts 16:5; Galatians 1:23; Ephesians 4:5; Philippians 1:27; Colossians 1:23; Colossians 2:7; 1 Timothy 1:19; 1 Timothy 5:8; 1 Timothy 6:10, 21; 2 Timothy 4:7; Titus 1:13; James 2:1; Jude 1:3. Having thus exalted the \"mystery of godliness,\" St. Paul goes on to expound it. He who (ὅς). This is generally adopted now as the true reading, instead of Θεός (ΟΣ, instead of ΘΣ). Bishop Ellicott satisfied himself, by most careful personal examination, that the original reading of the Cod. Alex. was ΟΣ, and that it had been altered by a later hand to ΘΣ. The Cod. Sinait certainly has ὅς, and to this all the older versions agree. The Vulgate has quod, agreeing with sacramentum and representing the Greek ὁ Accepting this, then, as the true reading, we proceed to explain it. Ὅς, who, is a relative, and must, therefore, have an antecedent. But there is no expressed antecedent of the masculine gender for it to agree with. The antecedent, therefore, must be understood, and gathered from the preceding words, τὸ μυστήριον τῆς εὐσεβείας. It can only be Christ. The mystery of the whole Old Testament, that which was wrapped in types and hidden under veils, was Christ (Colossians 1:27). Moses spake of him, the Psalms speak of him, the prophets speak of him; but all of them spake darkly. But in the gospel \"the mystery of Christ\" (Colossians 4:3)is revealed. Christ is the Mystery of Christianity. It is, therefore, no difficult step to pass from \"the mystery\" to \"Christ,\" and to supply the word \"Christ\" as the antecedent to \"who.\" Was manifested (ἐφανερώθη); a word frequently applied to Christ (John 1:31; 1 John 1:2; 1 John 3:5, 8, etc.). The idea is the same in John 1:14. Justified in the spirit. This is rather an obscure expression. But it seems to describe our Lord's spotless righteousness, perhaps with special reference to the declaration of it at his baptism, \"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.\" We have the same contrast between the flesh and the Spirit of Christ in 1 Peter 3:18. And between the flesh and the spirit of a Christian man in Romans 8:10, \"The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.\" To this clause apparently the remark of Chrysostom applies, \"God became man, and man became God.\" \"The spirit\" seems to mean the moral nature - the inner man. Seen of angels. Perhaps the multitude of the heavenly host who welcomed the birth of Christ were permitted to see the new-born Babe, as he seems to have done who described him to the shepherds as \"wrapped in swaddling clothes\" (Luke 2:12-14). Angels ministered unto him after the temptation (Mark 1:13), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:43, where the word ὤφθη is used), and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2). The special interest of angels in the \"great mystery\" is referred to in 1 Peter 1:12; Hebrews 1:6. Preached among the nations (ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν). It would have been better to keep the rendering \"Gentiles\" here, to mark the identity of thought with Ephesians 3:6, 8, where, in the apostle's view, the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, that they might be fellow-heirs with the Jews of the promises of God, is one main feature of the mystery (comp. 1 Timothy 2:7). Believed on in the world. The next step in this ascending scale is the acceptance of Christ in the world as the Savior thereof. The language here is not stronger than that of Colossians 1:5, 6, \"The word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world, and beareth fruit.\" And in Colossians 1:23, \"The gospel which was preached in all creation under heaven\" (comp. Romans 1:8). The statement in Mark 16:15-20 might almost have been in St. Paul's mind. Note the use there of the words κηρύξατε ἐκηρύξαν, τὸν κόσμον ὀ πιστεύσας πιστεύσασι ἀνελήφρη. Received up in glory. The change of \"into\" (A.V.) into \"in\" is of very doubtful propriety. In New Testament Greek ἐν, frequently follows verbs of motion, and means the same as εἰς, like the Hebrew בְּ. Our Lord is net said to have ascended in glory (as he appeared at the Transfiguration), but, as St. Mark has it, \"He was received up into heaven, and [there] sat down at the right hand of God,\" fulfilling John 17:5. This grand burst of dogmatic teaching is somewhat like that in 1 Timothy 2:5-7. There is no adequate evidence of its being, as many commentators have thought, a portion of a hymn or creed used in the Church. It rather implies the same tension in the apostle's mind which is apparent in other parts of the Epistle (comp. 1 Timothy 6:11 and following verses).NEWLINENEWLINE","1Tim.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - But for now, A.V.; saith for speaketh, A.V.; later for the latter, A.V.; fall away for depart, A.V. The Spirit saith expressly (ῤητῶς); only here in the New Testament, and very rare in classical Greek. But the adjective ῤητός, in the sense of something \"laid down,\" \"definite.... expressly mentioned,\" is common. It was, doubtless, on account of these prophetic warnings of a falling away from the faith, that the apostle gave the preceding heads of Christian doctrine in such a terse and tangible form, and laid such a solemn charge upon Timothy. (For examples of these prophetic utterances, see Acts 11:28; Acts 13:2; Acts 20:23; Acts 21:11; 1 Corinthians 12:8; 1 Corinthians 14. '30, 32, etc.) Shall fall away (ἀποστησονται). So St. Paul says (2 Thessalonians 2:3) that the day of Christ will not be, \"except the falling away (ἡ ἀποστασία) come first\" (comp. Hebrews 3:12). The faith; objective (see 1 Timothy 3:9 and 16, note). This \"falling away\" is to take place ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς; not, as in the R.V., in \"later times,\" but as in the A.V., \"the latter times.\" The adjective ὕστερος is only found here in the New Testament. But in the LXX. (e.g., 1 Chronicles 29:29; Jeremiah 1:19; Jeremiah 27:17, LXX.), ὕστερος means \"the last,\" as opposed to \"the first.\" And so the adverb ὕστερον always in the New Testament (see Matthew 4:2; Matthew 21:37; Matthew 26:60; or more fully ὕστερον πάντεν, 22:27). Here, therefore, ἐν ὑστεροις καιροῖς is equivalent to ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις (Acts 2:17) and ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις (2 Timothy 3:1; comp. James 5:3; 1 Peter 1:5; 2 Peter 3:3; Jude 1:18). It should be observed that in all these passages there is no article. Giving heed (προσέχοντες); as in ver. 13; in 1 Timothy 1:4; Titus 1:14; Acts 8:6, and elsewhere. Seducing spirits (πνεύμασι πλάνοις). Such were the \"lying spirits\" who deceived (ἠπάτησαν) Ahab to his destruction (2 Kings 22:22). Πλάνος, seducing, is not elsewhere found in the New Testament as an adjective (see Matthew 27:63; 2 Corinthians 6:8 2John 7, in all which places, however, it is almost an adjective). The idea is \"causing to wander,\" or \"go astray.\" St. John warns his people against such deceiving spirits (John 4:1-6). He calls them generically πνεύμα τῆς πλάνης, \"the spirit of error.\" Doctrines of devils; i.e. teachings suggested by devils. So the unbelieving Jews suggested that John the Baptist had a devil (Luke 7:33), and that our Lord himself had a devil (John 7:20; John 8:48, 52; John 10:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies for speaking lies in hypocrisy, A.V.; branded in their own conscience as with for having their conscience seared with, A.V. Through the hypocrisy of men, etc. The construction is rather obscure, as the most obvious way of construing is that of the A.V., where ψευδόλογων must agree with δαιμονίων. But then the clause, \"having their conscience seared with a hot iron,\" does not suit \"devils.\" It is therefore, perhaps, best to translate the clause as the R.V. does, and to explain, with Bishop Ellicott, that the preposition ἐν, which precedes ὑποκρίσει, defines the instrument by which they were led to give heed to seducing spirits, viz. the hypocritical preterites of the men who spake lies, and whose consciences were seared. If ψευδολόγων agrees with δαιμονίων, we must conceive that St. Paul passes insensibly from \"the devils\" to the false teachers who spake as they taught them. In the Gospels, the speech of the devils, and of those possessed by devils, is often interchanged, as e.g., Luke 4:33, 34, 41; Mark 1:23, 24. Men that speak lies (ψευδολόγω); only found here in the New Testament, but occasionally in classical Greek. Branded (κεκαυτηριασμένων); here only in the New Testament, but used in Greek medical and other writers for \"to brand,\" or \"cauterize;\" καυτήρ and καυτήριον, a branding-iron. The application of the image is somewhat uncertain. If the idea is that of \"a brand,\" a mark burnt in upon the forehead of a slave or criminal, then the meaning is that these men have their own infamy stamped upon their own consciences. It is not patent only to others, but to themselves also. But if the metaphor is from the cauterizing a wound, as the A.V. takes it, then the idea is that these men's consciences are become as insensible to the touch as the skin that has been cauterized is. The metaphor, in this case, is somewhat similar to that of πωρόω πώρωσις (Mark 3:5; Mark 6:52; John 12:40, etc.). The latter interpretation seems to suit the general context best, and the medical use of the term, which St. Paul might have learnt from Luke. The emphasis of τῆς ἰδίας, \"their own conscience,\" implies that they were not merely deceivers of others, but were self-deceived.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Created for hath created, A.V.; by for of, A.V.; that for which, A.V.

Commanding to abstain from meats; βρωμάτων (1 Corinthians 8:8; Hebrews 9:10; comp. βρώσει, Colossians 2:16; Romans 14:17). The word \"commanding\" has to be supplied from the preceding κωλυόντων, \"commanding not.\" Some of the sects prohibited the use of animal food. A trace of this asceticism in regard to food is found in Colossians 2:16, 21, 23. (For a full list of authorities on the asceticism of the Jewish sects, see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Introduction to the Epistle to the Coloss.,' pp. 83, 84.) The chief passages relating to it are those referred to above from Josephus: Γάμου ὑπεροψία παρ αὐτοῖς, \"They despise marriage;\" Ἐσσαίων οὐδεὶς ἄγεται γυναῖκα, \"None of the Essenes marry\" (Philo, 'Fragm.,' p. 633); \"Gens sine ulla femina, venere abdicata\" - \"A people without a single woman, for they renounce marriage\" (Plin., 'Nat. Hist.,' 5:15). As regards their food, Bishop Lightfoot says, \"The Essene drank no wine; he did not touch animal food. His meal consisted of a piece of bread, and a single mess of vegetables\" ('Introd.,' p. 86). Professor Burton (in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art. \"Gnosticism') says of the later Gnostics that, from their principle of the utter malignity of matter, and the elevating nature of γνῶσις, two very opposite results ensued - one that many Gnostics led very profligate lives; the other that many practiced great austerities in order to mortify the body and its sensual appetites (p. 770). Some of our modern Eneratites, in their language concerning the use of wine and beer, approach Gnosticism very closely. To be received (εἰς μετάληψιν); a classical word, but only found here in the New Testament, not used by the LXX. With thanksgiving. Observe the identity of thought with Romans 14:6. These passages, together with our Lord's action at the last Supper (Luke 22:17, 19), at the multiplication of the loaves and fishes (Luke 9:16), and St. Paul's on board ship (Acts 27:35), are conclusive as to the Christian duty of giving thanks, commonly called \"saying grace\" at meals.

Nothing is to be rejected. The A.V., \"nothing to be refused,\" manifestly uses \"nothing\" in its adverbial sense (\"in no degree,\" \"not at all,\" Johnson's 'Dict.'), as οὐδέν in Greek is also commonly used (Liddell and Scott). In fact, it is very difficult to construe the passage as the R.V. does. To say \"nothing is to be rejected if it is received,\" is scarcely sense. But to say that every creature of God is good (and on that account not to be rejected) if it is received with thanksgiving is very good and edifying sense. Creature (κτίσμα). The form commonly used by St. Paul is κτίσις (Romans 8:20, 21, 22; 2 Corinthians 5:17, etc.). But κτίσμα stands by the side of κτίσις, like βρῶμα by the side of βρῶσις ὅραμα by the side of ὅρασις πόμα by the side of πόσις, and many more. The form κτίσμα ισ found in James 1:18; and twice in Revelation. Good (καλόν); with reference to Genesis 1:10, 12, etc. To be refused (ἀπόβλητον); only here in the New Testament, but found in classical Greek, and not uncommon in the LXX. and other Greek versions, for that which is \"unclean,\" or \"abominable.\" If it be received with thanksgiving. This clearly refers to \"every creature of God,\" and is the condition on which it is good in relation to the receiver. Nothing can be clearer or more certain than that the apostle is not arguing against the Manichean doctrine of the evil of matter, or the works of the Demiurge, but against Jewish scruples about meats. \"Every creature of God,\" he says, \"is good\" - words which would have no force if the creatures in question were not admitted to be the works of God, but thought to be the works of the Demiurge. But applied to the Jewish scruples, the words are perfectly relevant. Every creature of God is good, and on no account to be treated as common or unclean (Acts 10:15, 28), provided only that it be received with thanksgiving.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Through for by, A.V. It is sanctified through the Word of God. Considerable difference of opinion prevails among commentators as to the precise meaning of this verse, especially of the phrase, \"the Word of God.\" Some refer to Gem 1:4, 10, 12, etc.; others to Genesis 1:29; Genesis 9:4, as containing the original grant of meats for the use of man; others to the scriptural phrases embodied in the words of the ἐντεύξις, the prayer of thanksgiving. Another possible reference would be to the Word of God recorded in Acts 10:13, 15, 28, by which that which had previously been unclean was now made clean or holy; or, lastly, it might mean \"the blessing of God\" given in answer to the \"prayer\" on each occasion, which suits well the present tense, ἁγιάζετι. Prayer (ἐντευξις; see 1 Timothy 2:1, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Mind for remembrance, A.V.; Christ Jesus for Jesus Christ, A.V. and T.R.; nourished for nourished up, A.V.; the faith for faith, A.V.; the good for good, A.V.; which thou hast followed until now for whereunto thou hast attained, A.V. If thou put the brethren in mind of these things (παῦτα ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς); if thou suggest these things to the brethren, lay them down as principles upon which their conduct is to be based; or, enjoin them (Liddell and Scott). It only occurs in this metaphorical sense here in the New Testament, but is very common in classical Greek, and not infrequent in the LXX. It has often the meaning of \"to advise\" or\" counsel.\" Of course, \"hypothesis,\" the assumed basis from which you start, is the same root. The brethren (τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς). The distinctive name for the members of Christ's Church, throughout the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles. The whole body is called ἡ ἀδελφότης \"the brotherhood\" (1 Peter 2:17; 1 Peter 5:9). A good minister (διάκονος). The application of this term to Timothy, like that of ἐπίσκοπος to presbyters (1 Timothy 3:2), is an indication of the early date of the Epistle, before the distinctive names of the Church officers had quite hardened down into a technical meaning. Nourished (ἀντρεφόμενος); here only in the New Testament, and not used in the LXX.; but in classical Greek not uncommon in the sense of \"brought up in,\" \"trained in from childhood.\" In Latin, innutritus. The phrase, \"nourished in the words of the faith,\" etc., explains the καλὸς διάκονος, and shows what a man must be to deserve the appellation - one, viz., who is nourished in the words of the faith, etc. The faith; here again objective, as in ver. 6 (see note). The good doctrine, etc. In opposition to the \"doctrines of devils\" in ver. 1. The different epithets of this true Christian doctrine are ἡ καλή (as here); ὑγιαίνουσα (1 Timothy 1:10; Titus 1:9; Titus 2:1); ἡ κατ εὐσεβείαν διδασκαλία (1 Timothy 6:3); and in 1 Timothy 6. I we have simply ηδιδασκαλία, without any epithet. In like manner, ἡ πίστις ἡ, ἀληθεία ἡ εὐσεβεία, severally denote the Christian religion. Which thou hast followed until now (η΅ι παρηκολουθήκας). This is a rather more faithful rendering than that of the A.V.; it is, literally, which thou hast kept close to, either for the purpose of imitating it, or, as 2 Timothy 3:10, for the purpose of observing it. Or, to put it differently, in one case so as to teach it identically, and in the other so as to know it perfectly. In this last aspect it is also used in Luke 1:3. The classical use is \"to follow closely any one's steps,\" or \"the course of events,\" when used literally; or, metaphorically, \"to follow with one's thoughts,\" \"to understand.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Unto godliness for rather unto godliness, A.V. The R.V., by putting a full stop after \"fables,\" disturbs the natural flow of the thought. The two imperatives παραιτοῦ and γύμναζε connect and contrast the thoughts in the two clauses of the verse, as the A.V. indicates by the insertion of \"rather.\" Profane (βεβήλους; 1 Timothy 1:9, note) Old wives' (γράωδεις); only here in the New Testament; not used in LXX.; rare in classical Greek. Exercise thyself unto godliness (γύμναζε σευτόν). The verb γυμνάζειν occurs in the New Testament only in this place, twice in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 5:14; 12:11), and once in 2 Peter (2 Peter 2:14). In the LXX. it occurs only once (2 Macc. 10:15), but is common in classical Greek. The metaphor is drawn from training for gymnastic exercises. As regards the whole passage, it seems that there were current among the Jews at this time many \"fables\" (1 Timothy 1:4; 2 Timothy 4:4; Titus 1:14; 2 Peter 1:16), childish legends and doctrines, some of them directed especially to enforcing certain rules about eating and drinking, and other \"bodily exercises,\" which St. Paul utterly discountenances, and contrasts with that \"good doctrine\" which he directs Timothy continually to teach. This would account, naturally, for the introduction of the phrase, γύμναζε σεαυτόν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Is profitable for a little for profiteth little, A.V.; for, for unto, A.V.; which for that, A.V. Bodily exercise. Exercise which only affects the body, such as those rules which the Jewish ascetics enforced. Γυμνασία only occurs here in the New Testament, and not at all in the LXX., but is not uncommon in classical Greek. Another form is γύμνασις, and γυμνάσιον is the place where such γύμνασις takes place. For a little; margin, for little, which is the best rendering, Πρὸς ὀλίγον, as Ellicott well remarks, may mean either \"for a little while\" or \"for a little\" (better, \"for little\"), but cannot mean both. The contrast with πρὸς πάντα determines its meaning here to be \"for little,\" which is exactly the same meaning as the A.V. Promise of the life. The genitive here is the genitive of the thing promised, as in Acts 2:33; Galatians 3:14; 2 Timothy 1:1. And the thing promised is \"the life that now is,\" meaning, of course, its enjoyment in peace and happiness (comp. Psalm 34:12 [33, LXX]., where θέλων ζωήν is parallel to ἀγαπῶν ἡμέρας... ἀγαθάς); and \"that which is to come,\" viz. eternal life). There is no occasion to strain after greater grammatical precision. There is no contradiction between tiffs statement of the happiness of a godly life and St. Paul's statement in 1 Corinthians 15:19. Another possible way of construing the words is that of Bishop Ellicott and the 'Speaker's Commentary:' \"Having the promise of life, both the present and the future.\" But in this case we should have had τῆς τε νῦν καὶ κ.τ.λ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Faithful is the saying for this is a faithful saying, A.V.

For to this end; or, with this in view. He thus justifies his assertion that the saying he had quoted is a faithful one, by showing that the promise and all that it contained was the ground of all his labors and those of his fellow-laborers in the gospel. Strive (ἀγωνιζόμεθα); so many good manuscripts, instead of T.R. ὀνειδιζόμεθα; but the reading is doubtful. The sense of the T.R., \"suffer reproach,\" seems preferable, and the expression more forcible, as conveying something more than mere labor - the bitter reproaches and persecutions which he endured (2 Timothy 3:11; 1 Corinthians 4:9-13; 2 Corinthians 11:23-27); and all because of his firm trust in the promises of the living God. Our hope set on. Rather a clumsy phrase, though it expresses accurately the ἠλπίκαμεν ἐπὶ Θεῷ ζῶντι; but it was hardly worth altering the A.V., \"we trust in the living God.\" In 1 Timothy 5:5 we have ἤλπικεν ἐπὶ Θεόν, with no appreciable difference of sense.

It is used very frequently in the Gospels of our Lord's commands to the apostles and others, and by St. Paul of his own apostolic directions to the Churches (1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:4, 6, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - An ensample to them that believe for an example of the believers, A.V.; manner of fife for conversation, A.V.; love for charity, A.V.; R.T. omits in spirit, A.V. and T.R. Let no man despise thy youth (comp. 1 Corinthians 16:11; Titus 2:15). The construction of the sentence is manifestly that adopted in the A.V. and followed in the R.V. Timothy would certainly be under forty years at this time, and might be not above thirty-five. Either age would be decidedly early for so responsible an office - one in which he would have many elders (πρεσβύτεροι) under him (1 Timothy 5:1, 17, 19). An ensample (τύπος); properly the original \"pattern\" or \"model\" after which anything is made or fashioned; hence a \"pattern\" or \"example.\" It is used in the same sense as here in Philippians 3:17; I These. 1:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9; Titus 2:7; 1 Peter 5:3. Them that believe. The R.V. has apparently so translated τῶν πιστῶν in order to assimilate it with the πιστῶν in ver. 10. But οἱ πιστοί are simply \"believers,\" or \"Christians\" - \"the flock,\" as St. Peter has it, and had better be so rendered. Timothy is exhorted to make it impossible for any one to question his authority on the score of his youth by being a model of the Christian graces required in believers. In word. Specially in his teaching. The exhortation to Titus (Titus 2:1, 7, etc.) is very similar, \"Speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine. In all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorrupt-ness, gravity, sound speech (λόγον ὑγιῆ)\" etc. (comp. too 1 Timothy 5:17; 2 Timothy 1:13). Manner of life (ἀναστροφῇ; see 1 Timothy 3:15, note). Purity (ἁγνείᾳ); elsewhere in the New Testament only in 1 Timothy 5:2, where it has the same special sense (compare ἀγνός, 2 Corinthians 11:2; 1 Timothy 5:22; Titus 2:5; 1 Peter 3:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTill I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Heed for attendance, A.V.; teaching for doctrine, A.V. Till I come (1 Timothy 3:14; 1 Timothy 1:3). Reading (τῇ ἀναγνώσει). The public reading of the Scriptures (the Lessons, as we should say). This we know was the practice in the synagogue (Luke 4:16, etc.; Acts 13:27; Acts 15:21; 2 Corinthians 3:15). We see the beginning of reading the New Testament in the Christian assemblies in Ephesians 3:4; and Colossians 4:16; and generally in the fact of Epistles being addressed by the apostles to Churches. The ἀναγνώστης, the reader, lector, was a regular order in the third and fourth centuries (Bingham, vol. 1. p. 288). The Grace is being revived in our day. Exhortation (τῇ παρακλήσει); see Acts 4:36, where Barnabas's name is interpreted as meaning \"Son of exhortation\" (R.V.), and Acts 13:15; comp. Romans 12:7 (where, as here, παράκλησις and διδασκαλία are coupled together); 1 Thessalonians 2:3, etc. Teaching (διδασκαλία); almost always rendered \"doctrine\" in the A.V. But here, where the act of teaching (like the act of reading, the act of exhorting, in the two preceding clauses) is intended, \"teaching\" is perhaps the best word according to our modern usage. As regards the difference between διδασκαλία and παράκλησις, the former would express \"doctrinal teaching,\" whether of dogma or of precept, the latter entreaties to believe the one and practice the other (see Acts 11:23 and Acts 14:22 for good examples of πράκλησις).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The gift (χάρισμα). The verb χαρίζομαι means \"to give anything freely,\" gratuitously, of mere good will, without any payment or return (Luke 7:42; Acts 27:24; Romans 8:32; 1 Corinthians 2:12, etc.). Hence χάρισμα came to be especially applied to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which are preeminently \"free gifts\" (see Acts 8:20). It is so applied in Romans 1:11; Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 1:7; 1 Corinthians 12:4, 9, 28, 30, 31; 1 Peter 4:10. Here, then, as in the similar passage, 2 Timothy 1:6, the \"gift\" spoken of is the special grace given by the Holy Ghost to those who are separated for \"the office and work of a priest in the Church of God by the imposition of hands\" (Ordering of Priests). This gift St. Paul bids him not neglect (μὴ ἀμέλει). The word contains the idea of contemptuous neglect - neglect as of an unimportant thing. In Matthew 22:5 the persons invited to the feast made light of it, and went away to other things which they cared mere about. In Hebrews 2:3, τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας, and Hebrews 8:9, imply a contemptuous disregard. So here Timothy is reminded that in his ordination he received a great χάρισμα, and that he must value it duly, and use it diligently. It must not be let lie slumbering and smoldering, but must be stirred up into a flame. The lesson here and in 2 Timothy 1:6 seems to be that we must look back to our ordination, and to the spiritual grace given in it, as things not exhausted. The grace is there, but it must not be lightly thought cf. Which was given thee by prophecy. This seems to be explained by Acts 13:1-3, where Barnabas and Saul were separated for their work by the laying on of the hands apparently of the prophets and teachers, at the express command of the Holy Ghost, speaking doubtless by the mouth of one of the prophets. Timothy, it appears, was designated for his work by a like command of the Holy Ghost, speaking by one of the Church prophets, and received his commission by a like \"laying on of hands\" by the elders of the Church. If St. Paul refers, as he appears to do, to the same occasion in 2 Timothy 1:6, then it appears that he laid his hands on Timothy, together with the presbyters, as is done by the bishop in the ordination of priests. The presbytery (τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου). The word is borrowed from the Jewish nomenclature (see Luke 22:6; Acts 22:5). In a slightly different sense for \"the office of a presbyter,\" Sus., 5:50 (Cod. Alex.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMeditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Be diligent in for meditate upon, A.V.; progress for profiting, A.V.; be manifest unto for appear to, A.V. Be diligent, etc. (αῦτα μελέτα). Give all your attention and care and study to these things. It is just the contrary to μὴ ἀμέλει in ver. 14. The verb μελετάω, besides this passage, occurs in its classical sense of \"premeditating\" or \"getting up a speech,\" in Mark 13:11 (where, however, the reading is doubtful), and again in Acts 4:25, in the sense of \"premeditating\" certain actions. A kindred use in classical Greek is \"to practice\" or \"exercise\" an art, as rhetoric, dancing, shooting with a bow, and the like. It is very common in the LXX., in the sense of \"meditating,\" practicing in the thoughts. Give thyself wholly to them (ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι); literally, be in these things; i.e. be wholly and always occupied with them. The similar phrases in Greek and Latin classics are Ἐν τούτοις ὁ Καῖσαρ ῆν (Plutarch); \"Omnis in hoc sum\" (Her., 'Ep.,' 1:1. 1); \"Nescio quid meditans nugarum, et totus in illis\" (Her., 'Sat.,' 1. 9. 2); and in the LXX., Ἐν φόβῳ Κυρίου ἰσθι ο{λην τὴν ἡμέραν (Proverbs 23:17). Thy progress (ἡ προκοπή). Progress, advance, or growth, is the idea of προκοπή. It is used twice in Philippians 1:12, 25. A good example of its use in classical Greek is that in Polyb., 3:4, Αὔξησις καὶ προκοπὴ τὴς Ρωμαίων δυναστείας. The use of the verb προκόπτω for \"to advance,\" \"make progress,\" is still more common (Luke 2:52; Romans 13:12; Galatians L 14; 2 Timothy 2:16; 2 Timothy 3:9, 14). It is used equally of progress in good or evil. Unto all. The R.T. reads πᾶσιν for ἐν πᾶσιν in the T.R., which may be rendered either \"to [or, 'among'] all persons\" or \"in all things.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To for unto, A.V.

The A.V., the doctrine, is the better rendering, though the difference of meaning is very slight. The use of ἡ διδασκαλίσ in 1 Timothy 6:1 and 3, and Titus 2:10 strongly supports the sense of \"doctrine,\" i.e. the thing taught (see note on ver. 13). Continue in these things (ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς); comp. Acts 13:43; Romans 6:1; Romans 11:22, 23; Colossians 1:23. It is impossible to give a satisfactory solution to the question - What does αὐτοῖς refer to? It seems to me necessarily to refer to what immediately precedes, viz. σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ, and so to refer rather to the sense of the words than to the exact grammar. The things which he was to \"take heed to\" were his own conduct and example (included in σεαυτῷ) an d the doctrine which he preached; and in a steady continuance in these things - faithful living and faithful teaching - he would save both himself and his hearers. The application of the words to the ταῦτα of ver. 15, or to all the things enumerated from ver. 12 onwards, or, taken as a masculine, to the Ephesians, or the hearers, as variously proposed by eminent commentators, seems alike impossible.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Tim.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Exhort for intreat, A.V.; and omitted. Rebuke not (μὴ ἐπιπλήξης); only here in the New Testament for the more usual ἐπιτιμάω (2 Timothy 4:2, and frequently in the Gospels) or ἐλέγχω, as Titus 1:13; Titus 2:15; Revelation 3:19, and elsewhere. In classical Greek it expresses a sharp castigation with words. Compare the \"patruae verbera linguae\" (Hor., 'Od.,' 3. 12:3). It answers to the Latin objurgo. An elder (πρεσβυτέρῳ). The context shows that the meaning is not a \"presbyter,\" but \"an old man.\" The precept has relation to Timothy's youth (1 Timothy 4:12). See the same order in respect to the persons to be admonished (Titus 2:1-6, where, however, we have the forms πρεσβύτας and πρεσβύτιδας with νέας and νεωτέρους). The direction is an instance of that admirable propriety of conduct, based upon a true charity, which vital Christianity produces. A true Christian never forgets what is due to others, never \"behaves himself unseemly.\" Exhort (παρακάλει); certainly a much better rendering than intreat in the A.V. The younger men. This and the other accusatives in this and the following verse are governed by παρακάλει; the prohibitive μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς Is con- lined to the πρεσβυτέροι. As brethren. This phrase shows that Timothy was still a young man himself. Observe, too, how even m reproving the sense of love is to be main- mined.

The use of the verb τιμάω in the comment on the fourth commandment in Matthew 15:4-6, where the withholding of the honor due consists in saying, \"It is corban, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me,\" and so withholding the honor due, shows clearly that in the notion of honoring is included that material support which their condition as widows required. So again in ver. 17 of this chapter, the \"double honor\" due to elders who labor in the Word and doctrine is clearly shown by ver. 18 to include payment for their maintenance. This is also borne out by the frequent use of τιμή in the sense of \"price\" (Matthew 27:6, 9; Acts 4:34; Acts 7:16; Acts 19:19; 1 Corinthians 6:20, etc.). The passage might, therefore, be paraphrased, \"Pay due regard to the wants of those widows who are widows indeed.\" The \"honor\" here prescribed would be exactly the opposite to the \"neglect\" (παρεθεωροῦντο) complained of by the Grecian Jews (Acts 6:1). The same idea is in the Latin honorarium, for a fee. Widows indeed; i.e. really, as in vers. 5 and 16, desolate and alone. We learn from this passage that the care of widows by the whole Church, which began at Jerusalem in the very infancy of the Church, was continued in the Churches planted by St. Paul. We find the same institution though somewhat different in character, in subsequent ages of the Church. Widowhood, as well as virginity, became a religious profession, and widows were admitted with certain ceremonies, including the placing on their heads a veil consecrated by the bishop. Deaconesses were very frequently chosen from the ranks of the widows (Bingham, 'Antiq.,' bk. 7. 1 Timothy 4.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Hath for have, A.V.; grandchildren for nephews, A.V.; towards their own family for at home, A.V.; this for that, A.V.; acceptable in the sight of for good and acceptable before, A.V. and T.R. Grandchildren (ἔκγονα; only here in the New Testament, but common in the LXX. and in classical Greek); descendants, children or grandchildren (as on the other hand, πρόγονοι in this verse includes grandparents as well as parents). In Latin nepotes, \"descendants;\" nos neveux (in French), \"our descendants;\" and so the English word \"nephews\" (derived from nepos, through the French neveu) properly means, and is commonly so used in all old English writers, as e.g., in Holinshed (Richardson's Dictionary), \"their nephews, or sons' sons, which reigned in the third place.\" Locke's phrase, \"a nephew by a brother,\" seems to show the transition to the modern use of \"nephew.\" But as the old meaning of \"nephews\" is now obsolete, it is better to substitute \"grandchildren,\" as in the R.V. Let them learn. Clearly \"the children or grandchildren\" is the subject. To show piety towards (εὐσεβεῖν). In the only other passage in the New Testament where this word occurs, Acts 17:23, it has also an accusative of the person - \"whom ye worship.\" In classical Greek also εὐσεβεῖν τινα is used as well as εἰς, or περὶ, or πρὸς τινα.. Their own family, of which the widowed mother or grandmother formed a part. The force of τὸν ἴδον οῖκον, \"their own family,\" lies in the implied contrast with the Church. As long as a widow has members of her own house who are able to support her, the Church ought net to be burdened (see ver. 16). To requite (ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδίδοναι); literally, to give back the return or exchange due. Ἀμοιβή is only found here in the New Testament, but is not uncommon in the LXX., and is much used in the best classical authors. The πρόγονοι had nourished and cared for them in their childhood; they must requite that care by honoring and supporting them in their old age. This is acceptable (ἀπόδεκτον); only here in the New Testament or LXX., and rarely if ever in classical Greek. The same idea is expressed in 1 Timothy 1:15, by πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος, and in 1 Peter 2:19, 20, by χάρις Τοῦτο χάρις παρὰ Θεῷ, \"This is acceptable with God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Hath her hope set on for trusteth in, A.V. A widow indeed (see ver. 3). Desolate (μεμονωμένη; only here in the New Testament, rare in Greek versions of Old Testament, frequent in classical Greek); literally, left alone, or made solitary, which is also the exact meaning of \"desolate,\" from solus, alone. A widow with children or grandchildren able to support her is not altogether desolate. As regards the connecting δέ, rendered \"now\" both in the A.V. and the R.V., Bishop Ellicott rightly renders it \"but.\" The apostle is contrasting the condition of the ὄντες χήρα, who has only God to look to for help, and who passes her time in prayer, with that of the widow with children and grandchildren. The second \"but\" in ver. 6 is no real objection; the widow who \"giveth herself to pleasure ' is contrasted in her turn with the devout prayerful widow whose conduct has just been described. The inference intended to be drawn, as Ellicott justly remarks, is that the one is eminently fit, and the other eminently unfit, to be supported at the common charge of the Church. Hath her hope set on God (see 1 Timothy 4:10). Supplications and prayers (see 1 Timothy 2:1, note). Night and day. Perhaps by night and by day would express the genitive better (Matthew 2:14; Luke 18:7), as indicating time when, rather than time how long. In Luke 2:37, Anna the prophetess is said to worship \"with lastings and supplications night and day (νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν),\" where the accusative conveys rather more the notion of vigils prolonged through the night. As regards the order of the words, \"day and night,\" or \"night and day,\" there seems to be no rule. St. Mark always has \"night and day\" (Mark 4:7; Mark 5:5); St. Luke uses both (Luke 2:37; Luke 18:7; Acts 9:24; Acts 20:31; Acts 26:7). St. Paul always \"night and day,\" as in this passage (Acts 20:31; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 1 Thessalonians 3:10; 2 Thessalonians 3:8; 2 Timothy 1:3). St. John always \"day and night\" (Revelation 4:8; Revelation 7:15; Revelation 12:10; Revelation 14:11; Revelation 20:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Giveth herself to for liveth in, A.V. Giveth herself to pleasure (ἡ σπαταλῶσα); only here and James 5:5 (ἐσπαταλήσατε \"taken your pleasure,\" R.V., \"been wanton,\" A.V.) in the New Testament, but found (as well as σπατάλη and σπάταλος) in Ecclus. 21:15, and in Polybius (Liddell and Scott). Trench ('Synonyms of New Testament,' p. 191) compares and contrasts στρηνιάω τρυφάω, and σπαταλάω, and says that the latter includes the idea of prodigality. The word brings into the strongest possible contrast the widow who was like Anna, and those whom St. Paul here denounces. Is dead while she liveth; or, has died (is dead) in her lifetime. She is dead to God, and, as Alford suggests, is no longer a living member of the Church of Christ. Compare St. Jude's expression \"twice dead\" (ver. 12). The expression in Revelation 3:1 is different, unless ζῶσα here can have the same meaning as ὄνομα ἔχει ὅτι ζῇ, \"though nominally alive as a Christian,\" etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - These things also command for and these things give in charge, A.V.; without reproach for blameless, A.V. These things, etc. The apostle had been giving Timothy his own instructions concerning widows and their maintenance by their own relations. He now adds the direction that he should give these things in charge to the Ephesian Church, lest they should be guilty and blameworthy by acting in a different spirit. He probably was aware of a disposition existing in some quarters to throw the burden of maintaining their widows upon the Church. Without reproach (ἀνεπίληπτοι); above, 1 Timothy 3:2, note. If they did not so they would be liable to the terrible reproach mentioned in ver. 8, that, Christians as they called themselves, they were in their conduct worse than unbelievers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Provideth for provide, A.V.; his own household for those of his own house, A.V. and T.R.; unbeliever for infidel, A.V. Provideth (προνοεῖ). Elsewhere in the New Testament only in Romans 12:17 and 2 Corinthians 8:21, where it has an accusative of the thing provided; here, as in classical Greek, with a genitive of the person; frequent in the LXX., and still more so in classical Greek. The substantive προνοία occurs in Acts 24:2 and Romans 13:14. His own household; because in many cases the widow would be actually living in the house of her child or grandchild. But even if she were not, filial duty would prompt a proper provision for her wants He hath denied the faith; viz. by repudiating these duties which the Christian faith required of him (see Ephesians 6:1-3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Let none be enrolled as a widow for let not a widow be taken into the number, A.V. Let none be enrolled, etc. The proper translation seems certainly to be (Ellicott, Alford, Huther, etc.), let a woman be enrolled as a widow not under sixty years old; i.e. χήρα a is the predicate, not the subject. It follows that the word \"widow\" here is used in a slightly different sense from that in the preceding verses, viz. in the technical sense of one belonging to the order of widows, of which it appears from the word καταλεγέσθω there was a regular roll kept in the Church. We do not know enough of the Church institutions of the apostolic age to enable us to say positively what their status or their functions were, but doubtless they were the germ from which the later development (of which see Bingham, bk. 7. 1 Timothy 4.) took its rise. We may gather, however, from the passage before us that their lives were specially consecrated to the service of God and the Church; that they were expected to be instant and con-slant in prayer, and to devote themselves to works of charity; that the apostle did not approve of their marrying again after their having embraced this life of widowhood, and therefore would have none enrolled under sixty years of age; and generally that, once on the roll, they would continue there for their life. Enrolled (καταλεγέσθω); only here in the New Testament or (in this sense) in the LXX.; but it is the regular classical word for enrolling, enlisting, soldiers, etc. Hence our word \"catalogue.\" In like manner, in the times of the Empress Helena, the virgins of the Church are described as ἀναγεγραμμένας ἐν τῷ τῆς ἐκκλησίας κανόνι (Socr., 1:17), \"registered in the Church's register,\" or list of virgins. Under three score years old. A similar rule was laid down in several early canons, which forbade the veiling of virgins before the age of forty. This care to prevent women from being entangled by vows or engagements which they had not well considered, or of which they did not know the full force, is in striking contrast with the system which allows young girls to make irrevocable vows. The participle γεγονυῖα, \"being,\" belongs to this clause (not as in the A.V. to the following one), as Alford clearly shows, and as the R.V. also indicates, by putting having been in italics; though it does not translate γεγονυῖα in this clause, unless possibly the word \"old\" is considered as representing γεγονυῖα. It should be, Let none be enrolled as widows, being under sixty years of age. The wife of one man; see above, 1 Timothy 3:2, the similar phrase, \"the husband of one wife\" (which likewise stands without any participle), and the note there. To which may be added that it is hardly conceivable that St. Paul should within the compass of a few verses (see ver. 14) recommend the marriage of young widows, and yet make the fact of a second marriage an absolute bar to a woman being enrolled among the Church widows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWell reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hath for have, A.V. (five times); used hospitality to for lodged, A.V. Well reported of (μαρτυρουμένη; see 1 Timothy 3:7 and note). This use is frequent in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 7:8; Hebrews 11:2, 4, 5, 39), also in 3 John 1:6, 12. Good works (ἔργοις καλοῖς). The phrase occurs frequently in the pastoral Epistles, both in the singular and in the plural (1 Timothy 2:10; 1 Timothy 3:1; in this verse; ver. 25; 6:18; 2 Timothy 2:21; 2 Timothy 3:17; Titus 1:16; Titus 2:7, 14; Titus 3:1, 8, 14). Our Lord had first used the phrase, and taught how \"good works\" were to be the distinctive marks of his disciples (Matthew 5:16), as they were evidences of his own mission (John 10:32, 33). It denotes all kinds of good actions as distinguished from sentiments. Love, e.g. is not a good work. Feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and visiting the sick are good works (see Matthew 25:35, etc.). Brought up children (ἐτεκνοτρύφησεν); only here in the New Testament or LXX., but found, as well as τεκνοτροφία, in Aristotle. The word must mean \"brought up children of her own,\" because τέκνον does not mean \"a child\" with reference to its age, but \"a child\" with reference to its parent who bare it. The only apparent exception in Holy Scripture is 1 Thessalonians 2:7, where the nurse's alumni are called \"her own children,\" but obviously this is no rent exception. The classical usage is the same. We must, therefore, understand the apostle here to mean \"if she hath brought up her children well and carefully, and been a good mother to them.\" The precept corresponds to that laid down for an ἐπίσκοπος in 1 Timothy 3:4. Possibly, as Grotius suggests, a contrast may be intended with the conduct of some heathen mothers, who, if they were very poor, exposed their children. Used hospitality to (ἐξενοδόχησεν); only here in the New Testament or LXX., but, as well as ξενοδόκος and ξενοδοχία, not uncommon in classical Greek. The common form in the New Testament is ξενίζειν. (For the inculcation of hospitality, see 1 Timothy 3:2, note, and 3 John 1:5.) Washed the saints' feet (see John 13:5-8; and comp. Luke 7:44, where the omission to provide water to wash the feet of a guest is reprobated as inhospitable). The saints (Romans 12:13). Hath relieved (ἐπήρκεσεν); only here and twice in ver. 16 in the New Testament, and. in 1 Macc. 8:26 and Romans 11:35; but common in classical Greek. The afflicted (τοῖς θλιβομενοις); used of any kind of trouble or afflictions (θλίψις); compare, for the precept, Romans 13:15. Diligently followed (ἐπηκολούθησε; comp. 1 Peter 2:21). The idea is somewhat similar to that of \"pressing on toward the goal,\" in Philippians 3:14 (see also ver. 12, where διώκω is rendered in A.V., \"I follow after\"). Good work. Here ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ, as in Acts 9:36; Romans 2:7, 10; Romans 13:3; 2 Corinthians 9:8; Ephesians 2:10; and frequently in the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 2:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Younger for the younger, A.V.; waxed for began to wax, A.V.; desire to for will, A.V. Refuse. Note the wisdom of Paul, who will not have the young widows admitted into the roll of Church widows, lest, after the first grief for the loss of their husbands has subsided, they should change their minds, and wish to return to the world and its pleasures, and so incur the guilt of drawing back their hands from the plough. Would that the Church had always imitated this wisdom and this consideration for the young, whether young priests or young monks and nuns! Waxed wanton against (καταστρηνιάσωσι). This word only occurs here, but the simple στρηνιάω is found in Revelation 18:7, 9, and is used by the Greek poets of the new comedy in the sense of τρυφᾶν, to be luxurious (Schleusner, 'Lex.'). Trench ('Synonyms of New Testament'), comparing this word with τρυφᾶν and σπαταλᾶν, ascribes to it the sense of \"petulance\" from fullness, like the state of Jeshurun, who waxed fat and kicked (Deuteronomy 32:15); and so Liddell and Scott give the sense of \"to be over-strong.\" The sense, therefore, is that these young widows, in the wantonness and unsubdued worldliness of their hearts, reject the yoke of Christ, and kick against the widow's life of prayer and supplication day and night. And so they return to the world and its pleasures, which they had renounced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaving damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Condemnation for dare, ration, A.V,; rejected for cast off, A.V. Condemnation; κρίμα, variously translated in the A.V. \"damnation,\" \"condemnation,\" and \"judgment.\" The word means a \"judgment,\" \"decision,\" or \"sentence,\" but generally an adverse sentence, a \"condemnation.\" And this is the meaning of the English word \"damnation,\" which has only recently acquired the signification of \"eternal damnation.\" Rejected (ἠθέτησαν); literally, have set aside, or displaced, and hence disregarded, an oath, treaty, promise, or the like. In the A.V. variously rendered \"reject,\" \"despise,\" \"bring to nothing,\" \"frustrate,\" \"disannul,\" \"east off.\" The κρίμα which these widows Brought upon themselves was that, whereas they had devoted themselves to a life of prayer and special service of the Church, they had now set aside this their first faith, and returned to the ordinary pleasures and avocations of the world.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Also to be for to be, A.V.; going for wandering, A.V. Also seems unnecessary, as \"withal\" seems to represent ἅμα καὶ. Learn to be idle (ἀργαὶ μανθάνουσιν). This is a construction which has no similar passage in Greek to support it, except one very doubtful one in Plato, 'Euthudemus' (vol. 4. p. 105, Bekker's edit.). But the other constructions proposed, viz. to construe μανθάνουσι, \"they are inquisitive, or, curious,\" as Grotius and substantially Bengel; or to take περιερχόμεναι after μανθάνουσι, \"they learn to go about\" (Vulgate, De Wette, etc.), cannot be justified by examples either, as μανθάνειν has always either an accusative ease or an infinitive mood after it, unless it is used in quite a different sense, as in the passage from Herod., 3:1, quoted by Alford: Διαβεβλημένος... οὐ μανθάνεις, \"You are slandered without being aware of it.\" In this difficulty it is best to take the sense given in the A.V. and the R.V., following Chrysostom, etc., and of moderns Winer, Ellicott, Alford, etc., which the general turn and balance of the sentence favors. Going about (περιερχόμεναι); comp. Acts 29:13, where there is the same idea of reproach in the term. It is used in a good sense in Hebrews 11:37. Tattlers (φλύαροι); only here in the New Testament, and once only in the LXX. (4 Macc. 5:10), but common in classical Greek. It means \"a trifling silly talker.\" The verb φλυαρέω occurs in 3 John 1:10. Busybodies (περίεργοι); only here and Acts 19:19 in the New Testament or LXX., but not uncommon in classical Greek, in the sense in which it is used here. The verb περιεργάζεσθαι occurs in 2 Thessalonians 3:11 in the same sense, \"meddling with what does not concern you.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Desire for will, A.V.; widows (in italics) for women A.V.; rule the household for guide the house, A.V.; for reviling for to speak reproachfully, A.V. Widows. As the whole discourse is about widows, it is better to supply this as the substantive understood in νεωτέρας. In ver. 11 we have νεωτέρας χήρας. The οῦν which precedes is a further proof that this direction or command of the apostle's springs from what he had just been saying about the young widows, and therefore that what follows relates to them, and not to women generally. In order to avoid the scandal mentioned in ver. 11 of the young widows first dedicating their widowhood to Christ, and then drawing back and marrying, he directs that they should follow the natural course and marry, in doing which they would be blameless. Bear children (τεκνογονεῖν): here only in the New Testament or LXX.; but τεκνογονία occurs in 1 Timothy 2:15 (where see note). Rule the household (οἰκοδεσποτεῖν; here only in this sense); act the part of οἰκοδέσποινα, the mistress of a family (Plutarch and elsewhere). οἱκοδεσπότης frequent in the New Testament, and kindred words are used in classical Greek. For reviling (λοιδορίας χάριν). The adversary (ὁ ἀντικείμενος), the opponent of Christianity, was always seeking some occasion to speak reproachfully of Christians and revile them. Any misconduct on the part of Christian widows would give him the occasion he was looking for. They must be doubly careful, therefore, lest they should bring reproach upon the Name of Christ (camp. James 2:7; 1 Peter 2:12; 1 Peter 4:4, 14, 15). \"Λοιδορίας χάριν is added... to ἀφορμὴν διδόναι to specify the manner in which the occasion would be used\" Ellicott). Do not give the adversary a starting-point from which he may be able to carry out his desire to revile the people of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor some are already turned aside after Satan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Already some are for some are already, A.V. Some. This is generally understood of some widows who had already given occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully, by turning aside from the path of Christian virtue which they had begun to walk in, and following Satan who had beguiled them into the path of vice and folly. But the words are capable of another meaning, equally arising kern the preceding verse, viz. that some have already followed the example of Satan, \"the accuser of the brethren,\" and have begun to revile Christianity, taking occasion from the conduct of some who were called Christians. These revilers might be not unbelieving Jews or heathen, but apostate or heretical Jews like those of whom the same verb (ἐκτρέπεσθαι) is used in 1 Timothy 1:6 and 2 Timothy 4:4. In something of the same spirit St. Paul called Elymas the sorcerer \"a child of the devil,\" because he sought to turn away Sergius Paulus from the faith, probably by speaking evil of Barnabas and Saul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Woman for man or woman, A.V. and T.R.; hath for have, A.V.; her for them, A.V.; burdened for charged, A.V. If any woman, etc. So the preponderance of the best manuscripts, and the texts of Lachmann, Buttmann, Tischendorf, etc. But the T.R. is retained by Alford, Ellicott, 'Speaker's Commentary,' and others. If the R.V. is right, the woman only is mentioned as being the person who has the management of the house. The precept here seems to be an extension of that in ver. 4, which relates only to children and grandchildren, and to be given, moreover, with special reference to Christian widows who had no believing relations to care for them, and so were necessarily cast upon the Church. Let her relieve them (ἐπαρκείτω, as in vet 10). Widows indeed (ταῖς ὄντως χήραις, as in vers. 2 and 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Those for they, A.V.; in teaching for doctrine, A.V. The elders (πρεσβυτεροι) here in its technical sense of \"presbyters,\" which in the first age were the ruling body in every Chinch (see Acts 14:23; Acts 20:2, 4, 6, 22), after the analogy of the elders of the Jews. Rule well (at καλῶς προεστῶτες). The presbyters or elders were the chiefs, rulers, or presidents, of the Church (see Romans 12:8; 1 Thessalonians 5:12; and above, 1 Timothy 3:4, 5). It seems that they did not necessarily teach and preach, but those who did so, laboring in the Word and teaching, were especially worthy of honor. Double honor (see note on ver. 3) means simply increased honor, not exactly twice as much as some one else, or with arithmetical exactness. So the word διπλοῦς is used in Matthew 23:15; Revelation 18:6; and by the LXX. in Isaiah 40:2; Jeremiah 16:18; and elsewhere also in classical Greek. And so we say, \"twice as good,\" \"twice as much,\" with the same indefinite meaning. The Word and teaching. The \"Word\" means generally \"the Word of God,\" as we have \"preach the Word,\" \"hear the Word,\" \"the ministry of the Word,\" \"doers of the Word,\" etc. And although there is no article before λόγῳ here yet, considering the presence of the preposition ἐν, and St. Paul's less careful use of the article in his later Epistles, this absence is not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of those considerations which lead to the conclusion that \"laboring in the Word\" refers to the Word of God. The alternative rendering of \"oral discourse\" or \"in speaking\" seems rather weak. Teaching would mean catechetical instruction and similar explanatory teaching. Labor (οἱ κοπιῶντες); a word very frequently used by St. Paul of spiritual labors (Romans 16:6, 12; 1 Corinthians 15:10; Galatians 4:11; Colossians 1:29, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - When he for that, A.V.; hire for reward, A.V. Thou shall not muzzle, etc. This passage, kern Deuteronomy 25, which is quoted and commented upon, in the same souse as here, in 1 Corinthians 9:9, shows distinctly that reward was to go with labor. The ox was not to be hindered from eating some portion of the grain which he was treading out. The preacher of the gospel was to live of the gospel. The laborer is worthy of his hire (ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὑτοῦ). In Matthew 10:10 the words are the same as here, except that τῆς τροφῆς (his meat) is substituted for τοῦ μισθοῦ. But in Luke 10:7 the words are identical with those here used, even to the omission (in the R.T.) of the verb ἔστιν. The conclusion is inevitable that the writer of this Epistle was acquainted with and quoted from St. Luke's Gospel; and further, that he deemed it, or at least the saying of the Lord Jesus recorded, in it, to be of equal authority with \"ἡ γραφή,\" the Scripture. If this Epistle was written by St. Paul after his first imprisonment at Rome, we may feel tolerably certain that he was acquainted with the Gospel or St. Luke, so that there is no improbability in his quoting from it. His reference to another saying of the Lord Jesus in Acts 20:35 gives additional probability to it. The passage in 2 Timothy 4:18 seems also to be a direct reference to the Lord's Prayer, as contained in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. St. Paul does not directly call the words ἡ γραφή, only treats them as of equal authority, which, if they were the words of Christ, of course they were.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgainst an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Except at the mouth of for but before, A.V. An elder; here clearly a presbyter, as the context proves. Receive (παραδέχου); give ear to, entertain; as in Acts 22:18, \"They will not receive thy testimony.\" At the mouth of, etc. There is a reference to the law in Numbers 35:30; Deuteronomy 19:15, and elsewhere (to which our Lord also refers, John 8:17), and St. Paul applies the principle of the law to Timothy's dealings with presbyters who might be accused of not \"ruling well.\" He was not to encourage delatores, secret accusers and defamers, but if any one had a charge to make against a ruler, it was to be done in the presence of witnesses (ἐπί with a genitive). A doubt arises whether\" the witnesses\" here spoken of were to be witnesses able to support the accusation, or merely witnesses in whose presence the accusation must be made. The juxtaposition of the legal terms κατηγορία and ἐπὶ μαρτύρων favors the strict meaning of μαρτύρων, witnesses able to support the κατηγορία. And, therefore, the direction to Timothy is, \"Suffer no man to accuse a presbyter unless he is accompanied by two or three witnesses who are ready to back up the accusation.\" The italic the mouth of, in the R.V., is not necessary or indeed justified. There is no ellipsis of στόματος.

Reprove; ἔλεγχε, not ἐπιπλήξῃς, as in ver. 1 (see Matthew 18:15). There, the fault being a private one, the reproof is to be administered in private. But in the case of the sinning presbyter, which is that here intended, Timothy is to reprove the offender \"before all,\" that others also may fear, and may be deterred by their fear from committing a like offence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - In the sight of for before, A.V.; Christ Jesus for the Lord Jesus Christ, A.V. and T.R.; prejudice for preferring one before another, A.V. I charge thee, etc. It has been well remarked that the solemnity of this charge indicates the temptation which there might be to Timothy to shrink front reproving men of weight and influence\" rulers\" in the congregation, and \"elders\" both in age and by office, young as he himself was (1 Timothy 4:12). Perhaps he had in view some particular case in the Ephesian Church. Charge (διαμαρτύρομαι; not παραγγέλλω, as 1 Timothy 6:13); rather, I adjure thee. The strict sense of διαμαρτύρομαι is \"I call heaven and earth to witness the truth of what I am saying;\" and then, by a very slight metonymy, \"I declare a thing,\" or \"I ask a thing,\" \"as in the presence of those witnesses who are either named or understood.\" Here the witnesses are named: God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels. In 2 Timothy 2:14 it is \"the Lord;\" in 2 Timothy 4:1 God and Jesus Christ, as also in 1 Timothy 6:13. In the passages where the word has the force of \"testifying\" (Luke 16:18; Acts 2:40; Acts 10:42; Acts 18:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:6, etc.), no witnesses are named, but great solemnity and earnestness are implied. The elect angels. This is the only passage where it is predicated of the angels that they are elect. But as there is repeated mention in Holy Scripture of the fallen angels (Matthew 25:41; 1 Corinthians 6:3; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 1:6; Revelation 12:7, 9), the obvious interpretation is that St. Paul, in this solemn adjuration, added the epithet to indicate more distinctly the \"holy angels,\" as they are frequently described (Matthew 25:31; Luke 9:26, etc.), or \"the angels of God\" or \"of heaven\" (Matthew 22:30; Matthew 24:36; Luke 12:8, 9; John 1:51). Possibly the mention of Satan in ver. 15, or some of the rising Gnostic opinions about angels (Colossians 2:18), may have suggested the epithet. The reason for the unusual addition of \"the angels\" is more difficult to adduce with certainty. But perhaps 2 Timothy 4:1 gives us the clue, where the apostle shows that in appealing to Jesus Christ he has a special eye to the great and final judgment. Now, in the descriptions of the lust judgment, the angels are constantly spoken of as accompanying our Lord (Matthew 16:27; Matthew 25:31; Mark 8:48; Luke 9:26; Luke 12:8, 9; 2 Thessalonians 1:7, etc.). If St. Paul, therefore, had in his mind the great judgment-day when he thus invoked the names of God and of Christ, he would very naturally also make mention of the elect angels. And so Bishop Bull, quoted in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' Without prejudice (χωρὶς προκρίματος); here only in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. or classical Greek, though the verb προκρίνω occurs in both. Although the English word \"prejudice\" seems at first sight an apt rendering of πρόκριμα, it does not really give the sense so accurately as \"preference.\" We commonly mean by \"prejudice\" a judgment formed prior to examination, which prevents our judging rightly or fairly when we come to the examination, which, however, is not the meaning of the Latin praejudicium. But προκρίνω means rather \"to prefer\" a person, or thing, to others. And therefore πρόκριμα means \"preference,\" or \"partiality,\" or, as the A.V. has it, \"preferring one before another.\" The two meanings may be thus expressed. \"Prejudice,\" in the English use of the word, is when a person who has to judge a cause upon evidence prejudges it without evidence, and so does not give its proper weight to the evidence. \"Prefer-once\" is when he gives different measure to different persons, according as He is swayed by partiality, or interest, or favor. St. Paul charges Timothy to measure out exactly equal justice to all persons alike. By partiality (κατὰ πρόσκλισιν). This also is an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον as far as the New Testament is concerned, and is not found in the LXX., but is found, as well as the verb προσκλίνω, in classical Greek. It means literally the \"inclination\" of the scales to one side or the other, and hence a \"bias\" of the mind to one party or the other. The balance of justice in the hands of Timothy was to be equal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Hastily for suddenly, A.V. Lay hands, etc. Surely if we are guided by St. Paul's own use of the phrase, ἐπίθεσις χειρῶν, in the only two places in his writings where it occurs (1 Timothy 4:14 and 2 Timothy 1:6), we must abide by the ancient interpretation of these words, that they mean the laying on of hands in ordination. So also in Acts 6:6 and Acts 13:3, ἐπιτίθεναι χεῖρας is \"to ordain.\" And the context here requires the same sense. The solemn injunction in the preceding verse, to deal impartially in judging even the most influential eider, naturally suggests the caution not to be hasty in ordaining any one to be an elder. Great care and previous inquiry were necessary before admitting any man, whatever might be his pretensions or position, to a holy office. A bishop who, on the spur of the moment, with improper haste, should ordain cue who afterwards required reproof as ἁμαρτάνων, sinning (ver. 20), would have a partnership in the man's sin, and in the evil consequences that flowed from it. And then it follows, Keep thyself pure; i.e. clear and guiltless (2 Corinthians 7:11), which he would not be if he was involved in the sin of the guilty elder. Observe that the stress is upon \"thyself.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDrink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Be no longer a drinker of for drink no longer, A.V. Be... a drinker of water (ὑδροπότει); here only in the New Testament. It is found in some codices of the LXX. in Daniel 1:12, and also in classical Greek. We learn from hence the interesting fact that Timothy was, in modern parlance, a total abstainer; and we also learn that, in St. Paul's judgment, total abstinence was not to be adhered to if injurious to the health. The epithet, \"a little,\" should not be overlooked. Was Luke, the beloved physician, with St. Paul when he wrote this prescription (see 2 Timothy 4:11)? It is also interesting to have this passing allusion to Timothy's bad health, and this instance of St. Paul's thoughtful consideration for him. Infirmities (ἀσθενείας); in the sense of sicknesses, attacks of illness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSome men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Evident for open beforehand, A.V.; unto for to, A.V.; men also for men, A.V. Some men's sins, etc. St. Paul is evidently here recurring to the topic which he had been dealing with ever since ver. 17, viz. Timothy's duty as a bishop, to whom was entrusted the selection of persons for the office of elder, or presbyter, and also the maintaining of discipline among his clergy. Alford sees the connection of the precept about drinking a little wine with what went before, and with this twenty-fourth verse, in the supposed circumstance that Timothy's weak health had somewhat weakened the vigor of his rule; and that the recommendation to leave off water-drinking was given more with a view to the firmer discharge of those duties than merely for his bodily comfort. This may be so. But there is nothing unlike St. Paul's manner in the supposition that he had done with the subject in hand at the end of the twenty-second verse, and passed on to the friendly hint with regard to Timothy's health, but then subjoined the fresh remarks in vers. 24 and 25, which were an afterthought. Evident (πρόδηλοι); only found in the New Testament, in Hebrews 7:14 besides these two verses, and in the apocryphal books of the Old Testament. It is common, with the kindred forms, προδηλόω προδήλωσις, etc., in classical Greek. It is doubted whether πρὸ in this compound verb has the force of \"beforehand,\" as in the A.V., and not rather that of \"before the eyes of all,\" and therefore only intensifies the meaning of δηλόω. But the natural force of πρὸ in composition certainly is \"before\" in point of time; and hence in a compound like πρόδηλος would mean\" evident before it is examined,\" which of course is equivalent to \"very evident.\" St. Paul's meaning, therefore, would be: Some men's sins are notorious, requiring no careful inquisition in order to find them out; nay, they of themselves go before - before the sinner himself - unto judgment. But there are also some whose sins follow after them. It is not till after close inquiry that they are found out. They go up to the judgment-seat apparently innocent, but after a while their sins come trooping up to their condemnation. This enforces the caution, \"Lay hands hastily on no man.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - In like maturer for likewise, A.V.; there are good works that are evident for the good works of some are manifest beforehand, A.V.; such as for they that, A.V. There are good works, etc. It is much best to understand πινῶν, as the A.V. does, and render the good works of some, answering to τινῶν αἱ ἁμαρτίαι of ver. 24. Such as are otherwise - i.e., not manifest beforehand - cannot be hid. \"They will be seen and recognized some time or other\" (Ellicott). Alford seems to catch the true spirit of the passage when he says, \"The tendency of this verse is to warn Timothy against hasty condemnation, as the former had done against hasty approval. Sometimes thou wilt find a man's good character go before him.... but where this is not so.... be not rash to condemn: thou mayest on examination discover it there be any good deeds accompanying him: for they... cannot be hidden.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Tim.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Are servants for servants as are, A.V.; the doctrine for his doctrine, A.V. Servants; literally, slaves. That slaves formed a considerable portion of the first Christian Churches may be inferred from the frequency with which their duties are pressed upon them (see 1 Corinthians 7:21-22; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 6:5-8; Colossians 3:11, 22; 1 Peter 2:18 (οἱ οἰκέται); see also 1 Corinthians 1:27-29). It must have been an unspeakable comfort to the poor slave, whose worldly condition was hopeless and often miserable, to secure his place as one of Christ's freemen, with the sure hope of attaining \"the glorious liberty of the children of God.\" Under the yoke; i.e. \"the yoke of bondage\" (Galatians 5:1). Perhaps the phrase contains a touch of compassion for their state (comp. Acts 15:10). How beautiful is the contrast suggested in Matthew 11:29, 30! Masters (δεσπότας); the proper word in relation to δοῦλος. The doctrine (ἡ διδασκαλία); equivalent to \"Christianity,\" as taught by the apostles and their successors (see the frequent use of the word in the pastoral Epistles, though with different shades of meaning (1 Timothy 1:10; 1 Timothy 4:6, 13, 16; 1 Timothy 5:17; 2 Timothy 3:10; 2 Timothy 4:3; Titus 1:9; Titus 2:10, etc.). Blasphemed (compare the similar passage, Titus 2:5, where ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ answers to ἡ διδασκαλία here). Βλασφημεῖν does not necessarily mean \"blaspheme\" in its restricted sense, but as often means \"to speak evil of,\" \"to defame,\" and the like. If Christian slaves withheld the honor and respect due to their masters, it would be as sure to bring reproach upon the Christian doctrine as if it taught insubordination and rebellion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Let them serve them the rather for rather do them service, A.V.; that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved for are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit, A.V. They that have believing masters. The direction in the preceding verse applied to all slaves, though chiefly to what, as Alford says, was far the commonest ease, that of those who had unbelieving masters. But now he adds a caution with regard to the Christian slave of a Christian master. There was a danger lest the feeling that slaves and masters are brothers in Christ should unduly interfere with the respect which he owed him as his master. And so St. Paul addresses a word of special advice to such. Let them not despise them. Let not their spiritual equality with their masters lead them to underrate the worldly difference that separates them; or to think slightly of the authority of a master relatively to his slaves (comp. 2 Peter 2:10). But let them serve them the rather, because they that partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. There is a good deal of obscurity in this sentence, but it may be observed first that the grammatical rendering of the R.V. is clearly right, and that of the A.V. clearly wrong. \"They that partake of the benefit\" is beyond all doubt the subject, and not the predicate. Then the construction of the two sentences (this and the preceding one) makes it certain that the subject in this sentence (οἱ τῆς εὐεργεσίας ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι) are the same persons as the δέσποται in the preceding sentence, because it is predicated of them both that they are πιστοί, and of both that they are, in convertible terms, ἀγαπητοί and ἀδελφοί. And this leads us, with nearly certainty, to the further conclusion that the εὐεργεσία, the beneficium, or \"benefit,\" spoken of is that especial service - that service of love and good will running ahead of necessary duty, which the Christian slave gives to the Christian master; a sense which the very remarkable passage quoted by Alford from Seneca strikingly confirms. The only remaining difficulty, then, is the meaning \"partake of\" ascribed to ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι But this is scarcely a difficulty. It is true that in the only two other passages in the New Testament where this verb occurs, and in its frequent use in the LXX., it has the sense of \"helping\" (Luke 1:54; Acts 20:35); but there is nothing strange in this. The verb in the middle voice means to \"lay hold of,\" You may lay hold of for the purpose of helping, supporting, clinging to, laying claim to, holding in check, etc. (see Liddell and Scott). Here the masters lay hold of the benefit for the purpose of enjoying it. There is possibly an indication in the word that the masters actively and willingly accept it - they stretch out their hand to take it. There does not seem to be any sense of reciprocity, as some think, in the use of ἀντι. The sense of the whole passage seems to be clearly, \"Let not those who have believing masters think slightly of their authority because they are brethren; but let them do them extra service, beyond what they are obliged to do, for the very reason that those whom they will thus benefit are believing and beloved brethren.\" Teach (δίδασκε). Observe the connection of this word with the ἡ διδασκαλίΑ of vers. 1, 3, and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Teacheth for teach, A.V.; a different doctrine for otherwise, A.V.; consenteth for consent, A.V.; sound for wholesome, A.V. Teacheth a different doctrine (ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖ); see above, 1 Timothy 1:3, note. Consenteth (προσέρχεται); very common in the New Testament, in the literal sense of \"coming to\" or \"approaching,\" but only here in the metaphorical sense of \"assenting to.\" The steps seem to he, first, approaching a subject with the mind with a view of considering it; and then consenting to it - coming over to it. The term προσήλυτος, a convert to Judaism, and the phrase from Irenaeus ('Fragm.,' 2.), quoted by Ellicott, Οὐ τοῖς τῶν Ιουδαίων δόγμασι προσέρχονται, \"They do not fall in with, or agree to, the doctrines of the Jews,\" sufficiently illustrate the usage of the word here.

He is puffed up (τετύφωται); see 1 Timothy 3:6, note. Doting (νοσῶν); here only in the New Testament, but found occasionally in the LXX. Applied in classical Greek to the mind and body, \"to be in an unsound state.\" Here it means \"having a morbid love of\" or \"going mad about.\" In this morbid love of questionings and disputes of words, they lose sight of all wholesome words and all godly doctrine. Questionings (ζητήσεις); see 1 Timothy 1:6, note. It corresponds nearly to our word \"controversies.\" Disputes of words (λογομαχίας); found only here. The verb λογομαχέω is used in 2 Timothy 2:14. Would that the Church had always remembered St. Paul's pithy condemnation of unfruitful controversies about words! Surmisings (ὑπόνοιαι); only here in the -New Testament. In classical Greek it means \"suspicion,\" or any under-thought. The verb ὑπονοέω occurs three times in the Acts - \"to deem, think, or suppose.\" Here the \"surmisings\" are those uncharitable insinuations in which angry controversialists indulge towards one another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPerverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Wranglings for perverse disputings, A.V. and T.R.; corrupted in mind for of corrupt minds, A.V.; bereft for destitute, A.V.; godliness is a way of gain for gain is godliness, A.V. Wranglings (διαπαρατριβαί, R.T.; παραδιατριβαί, T.R.). The R.T. has far the largest weight of authority in its favor (Ellicott). The substantive παρατριβή in Polybius means \"provocation,\" \"collision,\" \"friction,\" and the like. Hence διαπαρατριβή (which is only found here) means \"continued wranglings.\" The substantive διατριβή (English diatribe) means, among other things, a \"discussion\" or \"argument.\" The addition of πάρα gives the sense of a \"perverse discussion,\" or \"disputing.\" Bereft (ἀπεστερημένων). The difference between the A.V. \"destitute\" and the R.V. \"bereft\" is that the latter implies that they once had possession of the truth, but had lost it by their own fault. They had fallen away from the truth, and were twice dead. Godliness is a way of gain. The A.V., that gain is godliness, is clearly wrong, utterly confusing the subject with the predicate, and so destroying the connection between the clause and ver. 6. A way of gain (πορισμός); only here and in ver. 6 in the New Testament. but found in Wisd. 13:19 Wisd. 14:2; Polybius, etc. It signifies \"a source of gain,\" \"a means of malting money,\" or, in one word, \"a trade.\" The same charge is brought against the heretical teachers (Titus 1:11). The cause in the A.V. and T.R., from such withdraw thyself, is not in the R.T.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut godliness with contentment is great gain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Godliness, etc. The apostle lakes up the sentiment which he had just condemned, and shows that in another sense it is most true. The godly man is rich indeed. For he wants nothing in this world but what God has given him, and has acquired riches which, unlike the riches of this world, he can take away with him (comp. Luke 12:33). The enumeration of his acquired treasures follows, after a parenthetical depreciation of those of the covetous man, in ver. 11. The thought, as so often in St. Paul, is a little intricate, and its flow checked by parenthetical side-thoughts. But it seems to be as follows: \"But godliness is, in one sense, a source of great gain, and moreover brings contentment with it - contentment, I say, for since we brought nothing into the world, and can carry nothing out, we have good reason to be content with the necessaries of life, food and raiment. Indeed, those who strive for more, and pant after wealth, bring nothing but trouble upon themselves. For the love of money is the root of all evil, etc. Thou, therefore, O man of God, instead of reaching after worldly riches, procure the true wealth, and become rich in righteousness, godliness, faith,\" etc. (ver. 11). The phrase, Αστι δὲ πορισμὸς μέγας ἡ εὐσεβεία μετὰ αὐταρκείας, should be construed by making the μετα couple πορισμός with αὐταρκείας, so as to express that \"godliness\" is both \"gain\" and \"contentment\" - not as if αὐταρκεία qualified εὐσεβεία - that would have been expressed by the collocation, ἡ μετὰ αὐταρκείας εὐσεβεία. Contentment (αὐταρκεία). The word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in 2 Corinthians 9:8, where it is rendered, both in the R.V. and the A.V., \"sufficiency.\" The adjective αὐτάρκης, found in Philippians 4:11 (and common in classical Greek), is rendered \"content.\" It means \"sufficient in or of itself\" - needing no external aid - and is applied to persons, countries, cities, moral qualities, etc. The substantive αὐταρκεία is the condition of the person, or thing, which is αὐτάρκης.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The for this, A.V.; for neither can we for and it is certain we can, A.V. and T.R.; anything for nothing, A.V. For neither, etc. The omission of δῆλον in the R.T., though justified by many of the best manuscripts, makes it difficult to construe the sentence, unless, with Buttman, we consider ὅτι as elliptical for δῆλον ὅτι, The R.V. \"for neither\" seems to imply that the truth, \"neither can we carry anything out,\" is a consequence of the previous truth that \"we brought nothing into the world.\" which is not true. The two truths are parallel, and the sentence would be perfectly clear without either δῆλον or ὅτι.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd having food and raiment let us be therewith content.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But for and, A.V.; covering for raiment, A.V.; ice shall be for let us be, A.V. Food (διατροφάς); here only in the New Testament, but common in the LXX., rare in classical Greek. Covering (σκεπάσματα); also a ἅπαξ λεγόμενον in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., and rare in classical Greek. The kindred words, σκέπη and σκέπας, with their derivatives, are used of the covering or shelter of clothes, or tents, or houses. St. Paul may therefore have used an uncommon word in order to comprise the two necessaries of raiment and house, though Huther thinks this \"more than improbable.\" The use of the word \"covering\" in the R.V. seems designed to favor this double application. Ellicott thinks the word \"probably only refers to clothing.\" Alford says, \"Some take ' covering' of both clothing and dwelling, perhaps rightly.\" If one knew where St. Paul got the word σκεπάσματα from, one could form a more decided opinion as to his meaning. We shall be therewith content (ἀρκεσθήσομεθα). The proper meaning of ἀρκεῖσθαι followed by a dative is \"to be content with\" (Luke 3:14; Hebrews 13:5). There is probably a covert hortative force in the use of the future here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Desire to for will, A.V.; a temptation for temptation, A.V.; many for into many, A.V.; such as for which, A.V. A temptation. The reason of the insertion of the article before \"temptation\" in the R.V. seems to be that, as the three substantives all depend upon the one preposition εἰς, they ought all to be treated alike. But if so, the reasoning is not good, because \"temptation\" implies a state, not merely a single temptation. The prefixing of the article is therefore improper. It should be \"temptation,\" as in the A.V. and in Matthew 6:13; Matthew 26:41; Luke 22:40, etc. Snare (παγίδα); as 1 Timothy 3:7, note. The concur-pence of the two words περιρασμός and παγίς show that the agency of Satan was in the writer's mind. Several good manuscripts, Fathers, and versions, add the words τοῦ διαβόλου after παγίδα (Huther). Drown (βυθίζουσι); only here and Luke 5:7 in the New Testament. Found also in 2 Macc. 12:4, and in Polybius - \"to sink,\" transitive. Destruction and perdition (ὔλεθρον καὶ ἀπώλειαν). The two words taken together imply utter ruin and destruction of body and soul. Ὄλεθρος, very common in classical Greek, occurs in 1 Corinthians 5:5; 1 Thessalonians 5:3; 2 Thessalonians 1:9, and is limited in the first passage to the destruction of the body, by the words, τῆς σαρκός. Ἀπωλεία, less common in classical Greek, is of frequent use in the New Testament, and, when applied to persons, seems to be always used (except in Acts 25:16) in the sense of \"perdition\" (Matthew 7:13; John 17:12; Romans 9:22; Philippians 3:19; 2 Thessalonians 2:3; Hebrews 10:39; 2 Peter 3:7; Revelation 17:3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - A root for the root, A.V.; all kinds of for all, A.V.; some reaching after for while some coveted after, A.V.; have been led astray for they have erred, A.V.; have pierced for pierced, A.V. Love of money (φιλαργυρία); only here in the New Testament, but found in the LXX. and in classical Greek. The substantive φιλάργυρος is found in Luke 16:14 and 2 Timothy 3:2. A root. The root is better English. Moreover, the following πάντων τῶν κακῶν (not πόλλων κακῶν) necessitates the giving a definite sense to ῤίζα, though it has not the article; and Alford shows dearly that a word like ῤίζα, especially when placed as here in an emphatic position, does not require it (comp. 1 Corinthians 11:3, where in the second and third clause κεφαλή, being in the emphatic place, has not the article). Alford also quotes a striking passage from Diog. Laert., in which he mentions a saying of the philosopher Diogenes that \"the love of money (ἡ φιλαργυρία) is the metropolis, or home, πάντων τῶν κακῶν.\" Reaching after (ὀρεγόμενοι). It has been justly remarked that the phrase is slightly inaccurate. What some reach after is not \"the love of money,\" but the money itself. To avoid this, Hofmann (quoted by Luther) makes ῤίζα the antecedent to η΅ς, and the metaphor to be of a person turning out of his path to grasp a plant which turns out to he not desirable, but a root of bitterness. This is ingenious, but hardly to be accepted as the true interpretation. Pierced themselves through (περιέπειραν); only here in the New Testament, and rare in classical Greek. But the simple verb πείρω, to \"pierce through,\" \"transfix,\" applied 'especially to \"spitting\" meat, is very common in Homer, who also applies it metaphorically exactly as St. Paul does here, to grief or pain. Ὀδύνησι πεπαρμένος, \"pierced with pain\" ('Il.,' 5:399).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - O man of God. The force of this address is very great. It indicates that the money-lovers just spoken of were not and could not be \"men of God,\" whatever they might profess; and it leads with singular strength to the opposite direction in which Timothy's aspirations should point. The treasures which he must covet as \"a man of God\" were \"righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience meekness.\" For the phrase, \"man of God,\" see 2 Timothy 3:17 and 2 Peter 1:21. In the Old Testament it always applies to a prophet (Deuteronomy 33:1; Judges 13:6; 1 Samuel 2:27; 1 Kings 12:22; 2 Kings 1:9; Jeremiah 35:4; and a great many other passages). St. Paul uses the expression with especial reference to Timothy and his holy office, and here, perhaps, in contrast with the τοὺς ἀνθρώπους mentioned in ver. 9. Flee these things. Note the sharp contrast between \"the men\" of the world, who reach after, and the man of God, who avoids, φιλαργυρία. The expression, \"these things,\" is a little loose, but seems to apply to the love of money, and the desire to be rich, with all their attendant \"foolish and hurtful lusts.\" The man of God avoids the perdition and maul fold sorrows of the covetous, by avoiding the covetousness which is their root. Follow after (δίωκε); pursue, in direct contrast with φεύγε, flee from, avoid (see 2 Timothy 2:22). Meekness (πρα'υπαθείαν). This rare word, found in Philo, but nowhere in the New Testament, is the reading of the R.T. (instead of the πρᾳο;τητα of the T.R.) and accepted by almost all critics on the authority of all the older manuscripts. It has no perceptible difference of meaning from πραότης, meekness or gentleness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The faith for faith, A.V.; the life eternal for eternal life, A.V.; wast for art also, A.V. and T.R.; didst confess the good confession for hast professed a good profession, A.V.; in the sight of for before, A.V. Fight the good fight. This is not quite a happy rendering. Ἀγών is the \"contest\" at the Olympic assembly for any of the prizes, in wrestling, chariot-racing, foot-racing, music, or what not. Ἀγωνίζεσθαι τὸν ἀγῶνα is to \"carry on such a contest\" (comp. 2 Timothy 4:7). The comparison is different from that in 1 Timothy 1:18, Ἵνα στρατεύῃ... τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν,\" That thou mayest war the good warfare.\" The faith. There is nothing to determine absolutely whether ἡ πίστις here means faith subjectively or \"the faith\" objectively, nor does it much matter. The result is the same; but the subjective sense seems the most appropriate. Lay hold, etc.; as the βραβεῖον or prize of the contest (see 1 Corinthians 9:24, 25). Whereunto thou wast called. So St. Paul continually (Romans 1:1, 6, 7; Romans 8:28, 30; 1 Corinthians 1:29; Ephesians 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 2:12; and numerous other passages). He seems here to drop the metaphor, as in the following clause. Didst confess the good confession. The connection of this phrase with the call to eternal life, and the allusion to one special occasion on which Timothy \"had confessed the good confession\" of his faith in Jesus Christ, seems to point clearly to his baptism (see Matthew 10:32; John 9:22; John 12:42; Hebrews 10:23). The phrase, \"the good confession,\" seems to have been technically applied to the baptismal confession of Christ (compare the other Church sayings, 1 Timothy 1:15; 1 Timothy 3:1; 1 Timothy 4:9; 2 Timothy 2:11; Titus 3:8). In the sight of many witnesses. The whole congregation of the Church, who were witnesses of his baptism (see the rubric prefixed to the Order of \"Ministration of Public Baptism\" in the Book of Common Prayer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - I charge thee for I give thee charge, A.V.; of for before (in italics), A.V.; the for a, A.V. I charge thee. It has been well observed that the apostle's language increases in solemnity as he approaches the end of the Epistle. This word παραγγέλλω is of frequent use in St. Paul's Epistles (1 Corinthians 7:10; 1 Thessalonians 4:11: 2 Thessalonians 3:4, 6, 10, 12; and above, 1 Timothy 3; 1 Timothy 4:11; 1 Timothy 5:7). In the sight of God, etc. (compare the adjuration in 1 Timothy 5:21). Who quickeneth, etc. The T.R. has ζωοποιοῦντος. The R.T. has ζωογονοῦντος, with no difference of meaning. Both words are used in the LXX. as the rendering of the Pihel and Hiphil of תָיָה. As an epithet of \"God,\" it sets before us the highest creative act of the Almighty as \"the Lord, and the Giver of life;\" and is equivalent to \"the living God\" (Matthew 26:63), \"the God of the spirits of all flesh\" (Numbers 16:22). The existence of \"life\" is the one thing which baffles the ingenuity of science in its attempts to dispense with a Creator. The good confession refers to our Lord's confession of himself as \"the Christ, the Son of God,\" in Matthew 27:11; Luke 23:3; John 18:36, 37, which is analogous to the baptismal confession (Acts 8:37 (T.R.); 16:31; 19:4, 5). The natural word to have followed μαρτυρεῖν was μαρτυρίαν, as above ὁμολογίαν follows ὡμολόγησας; but St. Paul substitutes the word of cognate meaning, ὁμολογίαν, in order to keep the formula, ἥ καλὴ ὁμολογία.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The for this, A.V. without reproach for unrebukable, A.V. The commandment (τὴν ἐντολὴν). The phrase is peculiar, and must have some special meaning. Perhaps, as Bishop Wordsworth expounds it, \"the commandment\" is that law of faith and duty to which Timothy vowed obedience at his baptism, and is parallel to \"the good confession.\" Some think that the command given in vers. 11, 12 is referred to; and this is the meaning of the A.V. \"this.\" Without spot, without reproach. There is a difference of opinion among commentators, whether these two adjectives (ἄσπιλον ἀνέπιληπτον) belong to the commandment or to the person, i.e. Timothy. The introduction of σέ after τηρῆσαι; the facts that τηρῆσαι τὰς ἐντόλας, without any addition, means \"to keep the commandments,\" and that in the New Testament, ἄσπιλος and ἀνέπιληπτος always are used of persons, not things (James 1:27; 1 Peter 1:19; 2 Peter 3:14; 1 Timothy 3:2, 5:7); and the consideration that the idea of the person being found blameless in, or kept blameless unto, the coming of Christ. is a frequent one in the Epistles (Jude 1:24; 2 Peter 3:14; 1 Corinthians 1:8; Colossians 1:22; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:23), - seem to point strongly, if not conclusively, to the adjectives ἄσπιλον and ἀνεπίληπτον here agreeing with σέ, not with ἐντολήν. The appearing (τὴν ἐπιφανείαν). The thought of the second advent of the Lord Jesus, always prominent in the mind of St. Paul (1 Corinthians 1:7, 8; 1 Corinthians 4:5; 1 Corinthians 15:23; Colossians 3:4; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 2 Thessalonians 1:9, etc.), seems to have acquired fresh intensity amidst the troubles and dangers of the closing years of his life, both as an object of hope and as a motive of action (2 Timothy 1:10; 2 Timothy 2:12; 2 Timothy 4:1, 8; Titus 2:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Its own for his, A.V. This correction seems to be manifestly right. The same phrase is rendered in 1 Timothy 2:6 and Titus 1:3 \"in due time,\" in the A.V.; but in the R.V. 2:6 is \"its own times,\" and in Titus 1:3 \"his own seasons. In Galatians 6:9 καίρῳ ἰδίῳ is also rendered \"in due season,\" in both the A.V. and the R.V. Such a phrase as ἐν καιροῖς ἰδίοις must be taken everywhere in the same sense. It clearly means at the fitting or proper time, and corresponds to the πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου, \"the fullness of time,\" in Galatians 4:4. The two ideas are combined in Luke 1:20 (πληρωθήσονται εἰς τὸν καιρὸν αὐτῶν) and Luke 21:24 (comp. Ephesians 1:10). Shall show (δείξει). Δεικνύειν ἐπιφανείαν, \"to show an appearing,\" is a somewhat unusual phrase, and is more classical than scriptural. The verb and the object are not of cognate sense (as \"to display a display,\" or \"to manifest a manifestation\"), but the invisible God, God the Father, will, it is said, display the Epiphany of our Lord Jesus Christ. The wonder displayed and manifested to the world is the appearing of Christ in his glory. The Author of that manifestation is God. The blessed; ὁ μακάριος (not εὐλογητός, as in Mark 14:61), is only here and in 1 Timothy 1:11 (where see note) applied to God in Scripture. The blessed and only Potentate. The phrase is a remarkable one. Δυνάστης (Potentate), which is only found elsewhere in the New Testament in Luke 1:52 and Acts 8:27, is applied to God here only. It is, however, so applied in 2 Macc. 3:24 2Macc. 12:15 2Macc. 15:23, where we have Πάσης ἐξουσιας δυνάστης Γόν μέγαν τοῦ κόσμου δυνάστην, and Δυνάστα τὧ῀ν οὐρανῶν; in all which places, as here, the phrase is used to signify, by way of contrast, the superiority of the power of God over all earthly power. In the first of the above-cited passages the language is singularly like that here used by St. Paul. For it is said that ὁ πάσης ἐξουσίας δυνάστης, \"the Prince (or Potentate) of all power made a great apparition,\" or \"appearing\" (ἐπιφονείαν μεγάλην ἐποίησεν), for the overthrow of the blasphemer and persecutor Heliodorus. St. Paul must have had this in his mind, and compared the effect of \"the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,\" in overthrowing the Neros of the earth with the overthrow of Heliodorus (comp. 1 Thessalonians 1:7-10). King of kings, and Lord of lords, etc. (compare the slightly different phrase in Revelation 17:14 and Revelation 19:16, applied to the Son). So in Psalm 136:2, 3, God is spoken of as \"God of gods, and Lord of lords.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Light unapproachable for the light which no man can approach unto, A.V.; eternal for everlasting, A.V. Unapproachable (ἀπρόσιτον); only here in the New Testament, but found occasionally in. the later classics, corresponding to the more common ἄβατος. Whom no man hath seen, nor can see (comp. 1 Timothy 1:17 (where see note) and Exodus 33:20-23). The appearance of the \"God of Israel\" to Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, related in Exodus 34:9-11, was that of the Son in anticipation of the Incarnation. The invisibility of the essential Godhead is also predicated in our Lord's saying, \"God is a Spirit\" (John 4:24). This whole passage is a magnificent embodiment of the attributes of the living God, supreme blessedness and almighty power, universal dominion, and unchangeable being, inscrutable majesty, radiant holiness, and glory inaccessible and unapproachable by his creatures, save through the mediation of his only begotten Son.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCharge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - This present for this, A.V.; have their hope set on the uncertainty of for trust in uncertain, A.V.; on God for in the living God, A.V. and T.R. Charge (παράγγελλε); as in 1 Timothy 1:3; 1 Timothy 4:11; 1 Timothy 5:7; and in ver. 13, and elsewhere frequently. Rich in this present world. Had St. Paul in his mind the parable of Dives and Lazarus (comp. Luke 16:19, 25)? That they be not high-minded (μὴ ὑψηλοφρονεῖν); elsewhere only in Romans 11:20. The words compounded with ὑψηλός have mostly a bad sense - \"haughtiness,\" \"boastfulness,\" and the like. The uncertainty (ἀδηλότητι); here only in the New Testament, but used in the same sense in Polybius (see ἄδηλος in 1 Corinthians 14:8; and ἀδήλως in 1 Corinthians 9:6). The A.V., though less literal, expresses the sense much better than the R.V., which is hardly good English. Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; for enjoyment. The gifts are God's. Trust, therefore, in the Giver, not in the gift. The gift is uncertain; the Giver liveth forever. (For the sentiment that God is the Giver of all good, comp. James 1:17; Psalm 104:28; Psalm 145:16, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - That they be ready for ready, A.V. Do good (ἀγαθοεργεῖν; here only, for the more common ἀγαθοποιεῖν). That they be rich in good works (1 Timothy 5:10, note); not merely in the perishing riches of this present world - the same sentiment as Matthew 6:19-21; Luke 12:33 and 21. Ready to distribute (εὐμεταδότους); here only in the New Testament, and rarely in later classical Greek. The opposite, \"dose-handed,\" is δυσμετάδοτος The verb μεταδίδωμι means \"to give to others a share or portion of what one has\" (Luke 3:11; Romans 1:11; Romans 12:8; Ephesians 4:28; 1 Thessalonians 2:8). Willing to communicate (κοινωνίκους); here only in the New Testament, but found in classical Greek in a slightly different sense. \"Communicative\" is the exact equivalent, though in this wider use it is obsolete. We have the same precept in Hebrews 13:16, \"To do good and to communicate forget not.\" (For κοινωνεῖν in the sense of \"giving,\" see Romans 12:13; Galatians 6:6; Philippians 4:15; and for κοινωνία in the same sense, see Romans 15:26; 2 Corinthians 9:13; Hebrews 13:16.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLaying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The life which is life indeed for eternal life, A.V. and T.R. Laying up in store (ἀποθησαυρίζοντες); only here in the New Testament, but once in Wisd. 3:3, and occasionally in classical Greek. A good foundation (θεμέλιον καλόν). The idea of a foundation is always maintained in the use of θεμέλιος, whether it is used literally or figuratively (Luke 11:48; Ephesians 2:20; Revelation 21:14, etc.). There is, at first sight, a manifest confusion of metaphors in the phrase, \"laying up in store a foundation.\" Bishop Ellicott, following Wiesinger, understands \"a wealth of good works as a foundation.\" Alford sees no difficulty in considering the \"foundation\" us a treasure. Others have conjectured κειμήλιον, \"a stored treasure,\" for θεμέλιον. Others understand θεμέλιον in the sense of θέμα, a deposit. Others take ἀποθησαυρίζειν in the sense of \"acquiring,\" without reference to its etymology. But this is unlikely, the context being about the use of money, though in part favored by the use of θησαυρίζειν in 2 Peter 3:7. The reader must choose for himself either to adopt one of the above explanations, or to credit St. Paul with an unimportant confusion of metaphors. Anyhow, the doctrine is clear that wealth spent for God and his Church is repaid with interest, and becomes an abiding treasure. Life indeed (τῆς ὄντως ζωῆς); so 1 Timothy 5:3, 5, τὰς ὅντως χήρας ἡ ὄντως χήρα, \"widows indeed;\" and (John 8:36) ὄντως ἐλεύθεροι, \"free indeed,\" in opposition to the freedom which the Jews claimed as the seed of Abraham.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Guard for keep, A.V.; unto thee for to thy trust, A.V.; turning away from for avoiding, A.V.; the profane for profane and vain, A.V.; the knowledge which is falsely for science, falsely, A.V. Guard that which is committed unto thee; τὴν παραθήκην (παρακαταθήκην, T.R.). Guard for keep is hardly an improvement. The meaning of \"keep,\" like that of φυλάττω, is to guard, keep watch over, and, by so doing, to preserve safe and uninjured. This meaning is well brought out in the familiar words of Psalm 121, \"He that keepeth thee will not slumber.... He that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord himself is thy Keeper\" (so too Psalm 127:1; Genesis 28:15, etc.). Παραθήκη or παρακαταθήκη, occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in 2 Timothy 1:12, 14, where the apostle uses it (in ver. 12) of his own soul, which he has committed to the safe and faithful keeping of the Lord Jesus Christ; but in ver. 14 in the same sense as here. \"That good thing which was committed unto thee guard ['keep,' A.V.].\" There does not seem to be any difference between παραθήκη and παρακαταθήκη, which both mean \"a deposit,\" and are used indifferently in classical Greek, though the latter is the more common. The precept to Timothy here is to keep diligent and watchful guard over the faith committed to his trust; to preserve it unaltered and uncorrupt, so as to hand it down to his successors exactly the same as he had received it. Oh that the successors of the apostles had always kept this precept (see Ordination of Priests)! Turning away from (ἐκτρεπόμενος); only here in the middle voice, \"turning from,\" \"avoiding,\" with a transitive sense. In the passive voice it means \"to turn out of the path,\" as in 1 Timothy 1:6; 1 Timothy 5:15; 2 Timothy 4:4. The profane babblings (see 1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 2:16); κενοφωνία; only here and 2 Timothy 2:16, \"the utterance of empty words,\" \"words of the lips\" (2 Kings 18:20). Oppositions (ἀντιθέσεις); here only in the New Testament. It is a term used in logic and in rhetoric by Plato, Aristotle, etc., for \"oppositions\" and \"antitheses,\" laying one doctrine by the side of another for comparison, or contrast, or refutation. It seems to allude to the particular method used by the heretics to establish their tenets, in opposition to the statements of the Church on particular points - such as the Law, the Resurrection, etc. The knowledge which is falsely so called. There is a very similar intimation of the growth of an empty philosophy, whose teaching was antagonistic to the teaching of Christ in Colossians 2:8, and with which St. Paul contrasts the true γνώσις in ver. 3. This was clearly the germ (called by Bishop Lightfoot \"Gnostic Judaism\") of what was later more fully developed as the Gnostic heresy, which, of course, derived its name from γνῶσις, knowledge or science, to which they laid claim (see Bishop Lightfoot's able 'Introduction to the Epistle to Colossians,' specially p. 100; and his notes on 1 Timothy 2:8, sqq.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Timothy6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich some professing have erred concerning the faith.

Grace be with you. The authorities for σοῦ and ὑμῶν respectively are somewhat evenly balanced. The T.R. σοῦ seems in itself preferable, as throughout St. Paul addresses Timothy personally, and as there are no salutations here, as in 2 Timothy and Titus (see 1 Timothy 1:18; 1 Timothy 3:14; 1 Timothy 4:6, etc.; 1 Timothy 6:11, 20). This shorter form, ἡ χάρις, is used in the pastoral Epistles (2 Timothy 4:22; Titus 3:15)for the fuller and more usual form, Ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Ξριστοῦ (Romans 16:20; 1 Corinthians 16:23; 2 Thessalonians 3:18, and elsewhere). The short form also occurs in Hebrews 13:25. The words are a gracious, peaceful ending to the Epistle.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
