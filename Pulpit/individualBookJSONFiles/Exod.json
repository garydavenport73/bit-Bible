{"Exod.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-20. - THE EIGHTH PLAGUE. Notwithstanding his self-condemnation and acknowledgment of the righteousness of God in all the judgments that had been sent upon him (Exodus 9:27), Pharaoh no sooner found that the seventh plague had ceased than he reverted to his old obstinacy. He both wilfully hardened his own heart (Exodus 9:34); and God, by the unfailing operation of his moral laws, further blunted or hardened it (Exodus 10:1). Accordingly, it became necessary that his stubbornness should be punished by one other severe infliction. Locusts, God's \"great army,\" as they are elsewhere called (Joel 2:25), were the instrument chosen, so that once more the judgment should seem to come from heaven, and that it should be exactly fitted to complete the destruction which the hail had left unaccomplished (ver. 5). Locusts, when they come in full force, are among the most terrible of all the judgments that can befall a country. \"A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness\" (Joel 2:3). They destroy every atom of foliage - crops, vegetables, shrubs, trees - even the bark of the fruit-trees suffers - the stems are injured, the smaller branches completely peeled and \"made white\" (Joel 1:7). When Moses threatened this infliction, his words produced at once a great effect. The officers of the court - \"Pharaoh's servants,\" as they are called - for the first time endeavoured to exert an influence over the king - \"Let the men go,\" they said; \"knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?\" (ver. 7). And the king so far yielded that - also for the first time - he let himself be influenced by the mere threat of a judgment. He would have let the Israelites depart, before the locusts came, if only they would have left their \"little ones\" behind them (vers. 8-11 ). Moses, however, could not consent to this limitation; and so the plague came in fall severity the locusts covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with them (ver. 15); and all that the hail had left, including the whole of the wheat and doora harvests, was destroyed. Then Pharaoh made fresh acknowledgment of his sin, and fresh appeals for intercession - with the old result that the plague was removed, and that he remained as obdurate as ever (vers. 16-20). Verse 1. - Go in unto Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart. The word \"I\" is expressed in the original and is emphatic. It is not merely that Pharaoh has hardened himself (Exodus 9:34); but I have \"dulled\" or \"hardened\" him. Therefore condescend to see him once more, and to bear my message to him. The heart of his servants. Compare Exodus 9:34. As Pharaoh's determination began to waver the influence of the court officers increased. Hence the frequent mention of them in this part of the narrative. That I might shew them my signs. The \"fierceness of man\" was being \"turned to God's praise.\" It resulted from the obstinacy of Pharaoh that more and greater miracles were wrought, more wonderful signs shown, and that by these means both the Israelites themselves, and the heathen nations in contact with them, were the more deeply impressed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son. The Psalms show how after generations dwelt in thought upon the memory of the great deeds done in Egypt and the deliverance wrought there. (See especially Psalm 78, 105. and Psalms 106; but compare also Psalm 68:6, 7; Psalm 77:14-20; Psalm 81:5, 6; Psalm 114:1-3; Psalm 135:8, 9; Psalm 136:10-15.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself! The confession recorded in Exodus 9:27 had been a distinct act of self-humiliation; but it had been cancelled by subsequent self-assertion (ib. 34, 35). And, moreover, humility of speech was not what God had been for months requiring of Pharaoh, but submission in act. He would not really \"humble himself\" until he gave the oft- demanded permission to the Israelites, that they might depart from Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElse, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - To-morrow. Again a warning is given, and a space of time interposed, during which the king may repent and submit himself, if he chooses. The locusts. The species intended is probably either the Aeridium peregrinum or the Oedipoda migratoria. Both are common in Arabia and Syria, and both are known in Egypt. They are said to be equally destructive. The Hebrew name, arbeh, points to the \"multitudinous\" character of the visitation. A traveller in Syria says - \"It is difficult to express the effect produced on us by the sight of the whole atmosphere filled on all sides and to a great height by an innumerable quantity of these insects, whose flight was slow and uniform, and whose noise resembled that of rain; the sky was darkened, and the light of the sun considerably weakened. In a moment the terraces of the houses, the streets, and all the fields were covered by these insects.\" (Ollivier, Voyage clans l'Empire Ottoman, vol. 2. p. 424.) Into thy coast - i.e. \"across thy border, into thy territories.\" The locust is only an occasional visitant in Egypt, and seems always to arrive from some foreign country.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - They shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth. This is one of the points most frequently noticed by travellers. \"The ground is covered with them for several leagues,\" says Volney. \"The steppes,\" says Clarke, \"were entirely covered by their bodies.\" \"Over an area of 1600 or 1800 square miles,\" observes Barrow, \"the whole surface might literally be said to be covered with them.\" They shall eat the residue of that which escaped. Locusts eat every atom of verdure in the district attacked by them. \"In A.D. ,\" says Barhebraeus, \"a large swarm of locusts appeared in the land of Mosul and Baghdad, and it was very grievous in Shiraz. It left no herb nor even leaf on the trees. When their swarms appear,\" writes Volney, \"everything green vanishes instantaneously from the fields, as if a curtain were rolled up; the trees and plants stand leafless, and nothing is seen but naked boughs and stalks.\" And shall eat every tree. The damage done by locusts to trees is very great. \"He (the locust) has laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree; he hath made it clean bare and east it away; the branches thereof are made white\" (Joel 1:7). Travellers constantly notice this fact. \"When they have devoured all other vegetables,\" says one, \"they attack the trees, consuming first the leaves, then the bark.\" \"After having consumed herbage, fruit, leaves of trees,\" says another, \"they attacked even their young shoots and their bark.\" \"They are particularly injurious to the palm-trees,\" writes a third; \"these they strip of every leaf and green particle, the trees remaining like skeletons with bare branches.\" A fourth notes that \"the bushes were eaten quite bare, though the animals could not have been long on the spot. They sat by hundreds on a bush, gnawing the rind and the woody fibres.\" (See Pusey's Minor Prophets, p. 106.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They shall fill thy houses. Compare Joel 2:9. The witness of modern travellers is to the same effect. Morier says \"They entered the inmost recesses of the houses, were found in every corner, stuck to our clothes, and infested our food\" (Second Journey, p. 100). Burckhardt observes - \"They overwhelm the province of Nedjd sometimes to such a degree that, having destroyed the harvest, they penetrate by thousands into the private dwellings, and devour whatsoever they can find, even the leather of the water vessels\" (Notes, vol. 2. p. 90). An older traveller, Beauplan, writes as follows: - \"In June 1646, at Novgorod, it was prodigious to behold them, because they were hatched there that spring, and being as yet scarce able to fly, the ground was all covered, and the air so full of them that I could not eat in my chamber without a candle, all the houses being full of them, even the stables, barns, chambers, garrets, and cellars. I caused cannon-powder and sulphur to be burnt to expel them, but all to no purpose; for when the door Was opened, an infinite number came in, and the others went fluttering about; and it was a troublesome thing, when a man went abroad, to be hit on the face by those creatures, on the nose, eyes, or cheeks, so that there was no opening one's mouth but some would get in. Yet all this was nothing; for when we were to eat they gave us no respite; and when we went to cut a piece of meat, we cut a locust with it, and when a man opened his mouth to put in a morsel, he was sure to chew one of them.\" Oriental houses, it is to be borne in mind, have no better protection than lattice-work in the windows, so that locusts have free access to the apartments, even when the doers are shut. Which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen. Inroads of locusts are not common in Egypt. Only one reference has been found to them in the native records. When they occur, they are as destructive as elsewhere. Denon witnessed one in the early part of the present century. Two others were witnessed by Carsten Niebuhr and Forskal in 1761 and 1762 (Description de l'Arabie, p. 148); and another by Tisehendorf comparatively recently. The meaning in the text is probably that no such visitation as that now sent had been seen previously, not that Egypt had been hitherto free from the scourge. He turned himself and went out. Moses did not wait to learn what effect his announcement would have. He\" knew \"that Pharaoh would not fear the Lord. (See Exodus 9:30.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And Pharaoh's servants said unto him. This marks quite a new phase in the proceedings. Hitherto the courtiers generally had been dumb. Once the magicians had ventured to say - \"This is the finger of God\" (Exodus 8:19); but otherwise the entire court had been passive, and left the king to himself. They are even said to have \"hardened their hearts\" like him (Exodus 9:34). But now at last they break their silence and interfere. Having lost most of their cattle, and a large part of the year's crops, the great men became alarmed - they were large landed proprietors, and the destruction of the wheat and doora crops would seriously impoverish, if not actually ruin them. Moreover, it is to be noted that they interfere before the plague has begun, when it is simply threatened, which shows that they had come to believe in the power of Moses. Such a belief on the part of some had appeared, when the plague of hail was threatened (Exodus 9:20); now it would seem to have become general. A snare to us - i.e. \"a peril\" - \"a source of danger,\" the species being put for the genus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh. Pharaoh did not condescend so far as to send for them, but he allowed his courtiers to bring them to him. And he so far took the advice of his courtiers, that he began by a general permission to the Israelites to take their departure. This concession, however, he almost immediately retracted by a question, which implied that all were not to depart. Who are they that shall go? It seems somewhat strange that the king had not yet clearly understood what the demand made of him was. But perhaps he had not cared to know, since he had had no intention of granting it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And Moses said, We will go with our young, and with our old. This statement was at any rate unambiguous, and no doubt could henceforth be even pretended as to what the demand was. The whole nation, with its flocks and herds, was to take its departure, since a feast was to be held in which all the nation ought to participate. The Egyptians were accustomed to the attendance of children at national festivals (Herod. 2:60).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And he said, etc. Pharaoh's reply to the plain statement of Moses is full of scorn and anger, as if he would say - \"When was ever so extravagant and outrageous a demand made? How can it be supposed that I would listen to it? So may Jehovah help you, as I will help you in this - to let you go, with your families.\" (Taph is \"family,\" or household, not \"little ones.\" See Exodus 1:1.) Look to it; for evil is before you. Or, \"Look to it; for you have evil in view.\" Beware, i.e., of what you are about. You entertain the evil design of robbing me of my slaves - a design which I shall not allow you to carry out. There is no direct threat, only an indirect one, implied in \"Look to it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Go now ye that are men. Or, \"ye that are adult males.\" The word is different from that used in ver. 7, which includes women and children. And serve the Lord; for that ye did desire. Pharaoh seems to argue that the request to \"serve the Lord\" implied the departure of the men only, as if women and children could not offer an acceptable service. But he must have known that women and children attended his own national festivals. (See the comment on ver. 9.) Probably, he knew that his argument was sophistical. And they were driven out. Literally, \"One drove them out.\" Pharaoh's manifest displeasure was an indication to the court officials that he wished the interview ended, and as the brothers did not at once voluntarily quit the presence, an officer thrust them out. This was an insult not previously offered them, and shows how Pharaoh's rage increased as he saw more and more clearly that he would have to yield and allow the departure of the entire nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord brought an east wind. Locusts generally come with a wind; and, indeed, cannot fly far without one. An east wind would in this case have brought them from northern Arabia, which is a tract where they are often bred in large numbers. Denon, the French traveller, notes that an enormous cloud of locusts which invaded Egypt during his stay, came from the east. All that day. The rest of the day on which Moses and Aaron had had their interview with the Pharaoh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt. This statement is very emphatic, and seems to imply that the plague was more widely extended than any that had preceded it. Egypt extends about 520 miles from north to south, but except in the Delta is not more than about 20 miles wide. Columns of locusts of the length of 500 miles have been noticed by travellers (Moor in Kirby on Entomology, letter 6.), and 20 miles is not an unusual width for them. But such a length and such a breadth are not elsewhere recorded in combination. Thus the visitation was, in its extent as well as in its circumstances, plainly abnormal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The land was darkened. It is not quite clear whether the darkness here spoken of was caused by the locusts when they were still on the wing or after they had settled. It is a fact that the insects come in such dense clouds that while on the wing they obscure the light of the sun, and turn noonday into twilight. And it is also a fact that with their dull brownish bodies and wings they darken the ground after they have settled. Perhaps it is most probable that this last is the fact noticed. (Compare ver. 5.) All the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. Injury to fruit by the hail had not been expressly mentioned in the account of that plague, though perhaps it may be regarded as implied in the expression - that the hail \"brake every tree of the field\" (ver. 25). The damage which locusts do to fruit is well known. They devour it with the green crops, the herbage, and the foliage, before setting to work upon the harder materials, as reeds, twigs, and the bark of trees. In Egypt the principal fruits would be figs, pomegranates; mulberries, grapes, olives, peaches, pears, plums, and apples; together with dates, and the produce of the persea, and the nebk or sidr. The fruit of the nebk is ripe in March. There remained not any green thing. \"It is sufficient,\" observes one writer, \"if these terrible columns stop half an hour on a spot, for everything growing on it, vines, olive-trees, and corn, to be entirely destroyed. After they have passed, nothing remains but the large branches and the roots, which, being underground, have escaped their voracity.\" \"Where-ever they settle,\" says another, \"it looks as if fire had burnt up everything.\" \"The country did not seem to be burnt,\" declares a third, \"but to be covered with snow, through the whiteness of the trees and the dryness of the herbs.\" A fourth sums up his account of the ravages committed by locusts thus - \"According to all accounts, wherever the swarms of locusts arrive, the vegetables are entirely consumed and destroyed, appearing as if they had been burnt by fire.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste. Literally, as in the margin, \"hasted to call for M. and A.\" He had made similar appeals before (Exodus 8:8, 25; Exodus 9:27), but never with such haste and urgency. Evidently, the locusts were felt as a severer infliction than any previous one. I have sinned. So, after the plague of hail (Exodus 9:27); but here we have the further acknowledgment, against the Lord your God and against you; \"against the Lord,\" in disobeying his commands; \"against. you,\" in making you premises and then refusing to keep them (Exodus 8:15, 32; Exodus 9:34, 35).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Only this once. Compare Genesis 18:32. Pharaoh kept this promise. He did not ask any more for the removal of a plague. This death only - i.e. \"this fatal visitation\" - this visitation, which, by producing famine, causes numerous deaths in a nation. Pharaoh feels now, as his courtiers had felt when the plague was first threatened, that \"Egypt is destroyed\" (ver. 7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - He... intreated the Lord. Moses complied, though Pharaoh had this time made no distinct promise of releasing the people. He had learnt that no dependence was to be placed on such promises, and that it was idle to exact them. If anything could have touched the dull and hard heart of the king, it would have been the gentleness and magnanimity shown by Moses in uttering no word of reproach, making no conditions, but simply granting his request as soon as it was made, and obtaining the removal of the plague.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind. Literally, \"a very strong sea-wind\" - i.e. one which blew from the Mediterranean, and which might, therefore, so far, be north, north-west, or north-east. As it blew the locusts into the \"Sea of Weeds,\" i.e. the Red Sea, it must have been actually a north-west wind, and so passing obliquely over Egypt, have carried the locusts in a south-easterly direction. Cast them into the Red Sea. Literally, \"the Sea of Weeds.\" No commentater doubts that the Red Sea is here meant. It 'seems to have received its Hebrew appellation, Yam Suph, \"Sea of Weeds,\" either from the quantity of sea-weed which it throws up, or, more probably, from the fact that anciently its north-western recess was connected with a marshy tract extending from the present head of the Gulf of Suez nearly to the Bitter Lakes, in which grew abundant weeds and water-plants. There remained not one locust. The sudden and entire departure of locusts is as remarkable as their coming. \"At the hour of prime,\" says one writer, \"they began to depart, and at midday there was not one remaining.\", \"A wind from the south-west,\" says another, \"which had brought them, so completely drove them forwards that not a vestige of them was to be seen two hours afterwards\" (Morier, 'Second Journey,' p. 98).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. The word used here is the intensive one, khazoq, instead of the milder kabod of ver. 1. Pharaoh's prolonged obstinacy and impenitence was receiving aggravation by the working of the just laws of God. (See the comment on Exodus 4:21.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 10:21-29NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-29 - THE NINTH PLAGUE. The ninth plague, like the third and the sixth, was inflicted without special warning. God had announced, after the plague of boils, that he was about to \"send all his plagues upon the heart\" of the king; and so a succession of inflictions was to be expected. The ninth plague probably followed the eighth after a very short interval. It is rightly regarded as an aggravation of a well-known natural phenomenon - the Khamsin, or \"Wind of the Desert\" which commonly visits Egypt about the time of the vernal equinox, and is accompanied by an awful and weird darkness. This is caused by the dense clouds of fine sand which the wind brings with it, which intercept the sun's light, and produce a darkness beyond that of our worst fogs, and compared by some travellers to \"the most gloomy night.\" The wind is depressing and annoying to an extreme degree. \"While it lasts no man rises from his place; men and beasts hide themselves; the inhabitants of towns and villages shut themselves up in their houses, in underground apartments, or vaults.\" It usually blows for a space of two, or at most three, days, and sometimes with great violence, though more often with only moderate force. The visitation here recorded was peculiar,NEWLINENEWLINE1. In its extent, covering as it did \"all the land d Egypt;\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. In its intensity - \"they saw not one another\" (ver. 23) - \"darkness which may be felt\" (ver. 21);NEWLINENEWLINE3. In its circumscription, extending, as it did, to all Egypt except only the land of Goshen (ver. 23). These circumstances made Pharaoh at once recognise its heaven-sent character, and request its removal of Moses, whom he sought to persuade by conceding the departure of the Israelites with their families. He marred, however, the whole grace of this concession by a proviso that they should leave behind them their flocks and herds, viewing these as, equally with their families, a security for their return. Moses therefore indignantly rejected his offer - the flocks and the herds should go with them - he would not have a hoof left behind - they did not know what sacrifices would be required at the feast which they were about to keep, or how many (ver. 25, 26) - therefore they must take all. Pharaoh, greatly angered, forthwith broke up the conference (ver. 28), but not, as it would seem, before Moses, equally displeased, had announced the tenth plague, and the results which would follow it (Exodus 11:4-8). Verse 21. - Darkness which may be felt. Literally, \"and one shall feel, or grasp, darkness.\" The hyperbole is no doubt extreme; but the general sentiment of mankind has approved the phrase, which exactly expresses what men feel in absolute and complete darkness. Kalisch renders, \"a darkness in which men grope.\" But the grammatical construction does not allow of this.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A thick darkness. - Literally, \"An obscurity of darkness.\" The phrase is intensitive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - They saw not one another. Or, \"Man did not see his brother.\" The descriptive phrases previously used are poetic, and might imply many different degrees of obscurity. This seems distinctly to shew that pitch darkness is meant. Such absolute obscurity is far beyond anything which the khamsin produces, even when it is most severe, and indicates the miraculous character of the visitation. Neither rose any from his place for three days. It is not meant that no one moved about his house, but that no one quitted it. (Compare Exodus 16:29, where the phrase used is similar.) No one went out into the unnatural darkness out of doors, which he dreaded. All stayed at home, and did what they had to do by the artificial light of lamps or torches. All the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. It is not explained how this was effected. Some suppose that the sand-storm did not extend to the land of Goshen. But in that case, such Egyptians as lived among the Israelites - their neighbours. (Exodus 11:2) - would have shared the benefit, which seems not to have been the case. I should rather suppose that the storm was general, and that the Israelites were supplied with a light, not that of the sun, by miracle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Only let your flocks and your herds be stayed. The pitch darkness is more than Pharaoh can bear. On the third day of its duration probably, he sends a messenger who succeeds in finding Moses, and conducting him to the monarch's presence. He has made up his mind to yield another point - that on which he insisted so strongly at the last interview (vers. 10, 11) - he will let the Israelites go with their families - only, their flocks and herds must remain behind. This will be, he considers, a sufficient security for their return; since without cattle they would be unable to support life for many days in the wilderness. Your little ones. Rather, \"your families.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - Moses absolutely refuses the suggested compromise. He had already declared on a former occasion, \"With our young and with our old we will go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds we will go\" (ver. 9). He is not inclined to retract now, after two additional plagues, what he had demanded before them. He does not refuse, however, to set forth his reasons. The cattle must go because the feast which they are about to keep requires sacrifices- they must all go, because the Israelites do not as yet know what animals, or how many of each, will be required of them. The feast was a new thing, without precedent; its ritual was not yet laid down.

No doubt he thought that now the intention of Moses to deprive him altogether of the services of so many hundred thousand slaves was palpable, and scarcely concealed. Greatly enraged, he gives vent to his rage, with the want of self-control common among Oriental monarchs - rudely bids Moses be gone (Get thee from me), threatens him (take heed to thyself), and bids hires never more seek his presence, under the penalty of instant death, if he makes his appearance. Considering the degree of civilization, refinement, and politeness to which the Egyptians had attained under the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, such an outbreak must be regarded as abnormal, and as implying violent excitement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And Moses said, etc. The reply of Moses, so far, is simple and dignified. Thou hast spoken well, he says - \"thou hast made a right decision - further interviews between me and thee are useless, can lead to no result, only waste time. This shall be our last interview - I will see thy face no more.\" It is generally agreed however that Moses did not quit the presence with these words; but continued to address Pharaoh for some little time, making his parting speech in the terms which are recorded in vers. 4-8 of the next chapter. Having announced the Tenth Plague, the coming destruction of the first-born, he turned and \"went out from Pharaoh in a great anger\" (Exodus 11:8).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - We have here a parenthetic statement of something that had previously happened. Before Moses was summoned to appear in the presence of Pharaoh as related in Exodus 10:24, it had been expressly revealed to him by God,NEWLINENEWLINE1. That one more plague, and one only, was impending;NEWLINENEWLINE2. That this infliction would be effectual, and be followed by the departure of the Israelites; and,NEWLINENEWLINE3. That instead of reluctantly allowing them to withdraw from his kingdom, the monarch would be eager for their departure and would actually hasten it. He had also been told that the time was now come when the promise made to him in Mount Horeb, that his people should \"spoil the Egyptians\" (Exodus 3:22), would receive its accomplishment. The Israelites, before departing, were to ask their Egyptian neighbours for any articles of gold and silver that they possessed, and would receive them (ver. 2). The reasons for this extraordinary generosity on the part of the Egyptians are then mentioned, in prolongation of the parenthesis.NEWLINENEWLINE1. God \"gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians\"; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. The circumstances of the time had exalted Moses, and made him be looked upon as \"very great\" (ver. 3), so that there was a general inclination to carry out his wishes. Verse 1. - And the Lord spake unto Moses. Rather, \"Now the Lord had said unto Moses.\" The Hebrew has no form for the pluperfect tease, and is consequently obliged to make up for the grammatical deficiency by using the simple preterite in a pluperfect sense. We cannot definitely fix the time when Moses had received this revelation; but the expression, one plague more, shows that it was after the commencement of the \"plague of darkness.\" When he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out altogether. The Hebrew win not bear this rendering. It runs distinctly thus - \"When he shall let you go altogether, he will assuredly thrust you out hence.\" As Canon Cook notes, \"the meaning is - when at last he lets you depart, with children, flocks, herds, and all your possessions, he will compel you to depart in haste\" (Speaker's Commentary, vol. 1. p. 290). It has been well noticed by the same writer that both this announcement, and the previous relentings of Pharaoh, would have caused Moses to have preparations made, and to hold the Israelites in readiness for a start upon their journey almost at any moment. No doubt a most careful and elaborate organization of the people must have been necessary; but there had been abundant time for such arrangements during the twelvemonth that had elapsed since the return of Moses from Midian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Every man... every woman. In Exodus 3:22 only women had been mentioned. Now the terms of the direction were enlarged. It is worthy of notice that gold and silver ornaments - ear-rings, collars, armlets, bracelets, and anklets, were worn almost as much by the Egyptian men of the Rameside period as by the women. Borrow. On this faulty translation, see the comment on Exodus 3:22. Jewels. Literally, \"articles.\" The word is one of a very wide meaning, and might include drinking-cups and other vessels; but from the statement in Exodus 3:22, that they were to \"put them on their sons and on their daughters\" it is clear that personal ornaments are especially meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And the Lord gave the people favour - i.e. When the time came. See below, Exodus 12:36. Moreover the man Moses, etc. It has been supposed that this is an interpolation, and argued that Moses, being so \"meek\" as he was (Numbers 12:3), would not have spoken of himself in the terms here used. But very great here only means \"very influential;\" and the fact is stated, not to glorify Moses, but to account for the ornaments being so generally given. Moreover, it is highly improbable that any other writer than himself would have so baldly and bluntly designated Moses as the man Moses. (Compare Deuteronomy 33:1; Deuteronomy 34:5; Joshua 1:1, 13, 15; Joshua 14:6, 7; Joshua 22:2, 4; etc.) The \"greatness\" which Moses had now attained was due to the powers which he had shown. First of all, he had confounded the magicians (Exodus 8:18, 19); then he had so far impressed the courtiers that a number of them took advantage of one of his warnings and thereby saved their cattle and slaves (Exodus 9:20). Finally, he had forced the entire Court to acknowledge that it lay in his power to destroy or save Egypt (Exodus 10:7). He had after that parleyed with the king very much as an equal (ib. 8-11; 16 -18). It is no wonder that the Egyptians, who regarded their king as a \"great god,\" were deeply impressed.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 11:4NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-8. - The writer returns here to his account of the last interview between Moses and Pharaoh, repeating the introductory words of Exodus 10:29 - \"and Moses said.\" Having accepted his dismissal, and declared that he would not see the face of Pharaoh any more (ibid.), Moses, before quitting the presence, proceeded to announce the last plague, prefacing the announcement, as usual (Exodus 7:17; Exodus 8:2; Exodus 9:1, 13; Exodus 10:3), with the solemn declaration, which showed that he acted in the matter merely as God's instrument - \" Thus saith Jehovah.\" He makes the announcement with the utmost plainness, noting the exact Lime of the visitation (ver. 4) - its extent (ver. 5) - the terrible \"cry\" that would follow (ver. 6) the complete exemption of the Israelites (ver. 7) - the message which Pharaoh would send him by his servants, to depart at once - and his own intention of acting on it (ver. 8). Then, without waiting for a reply, in hot anger at the prolonged obstinacy of the monarch, he went out. Verse 4. - About midnight. - Compare Exodus 12:29. It would add to the horror of the infliction that it should come in the depth of the night. Probably the night intended was not the next night, but one left purposely indefinite, that terror and suspense might work upon the mind of Pharaoh. Shall I go out. The word \"I\" is repressed in the original, and is emphatic. This crowning plague Jehovah inflicts by no instrumentality, but takes wholly upon himself.

The law of primogeniture prevailed in Egypt, as among most of the nations of antiquity. The monarchy (under the New Empire, at any rate) was hereditary, and the eldest son was known as erpa suten sa, or \"hereditary Crown Prince.\" Estates descended to the eldest son, and in many cases high dignities also. No severer blow could have been sent on the nation, if it were not to be annihilated, than the less in each house of the hope of the family - the parents' stay, the other children's guardian and protector. Who sitteth. \"Sitteth\" refers to \"Pharaoh,\" not to \"first-born.\" The meaning is, \"from the first-born of the king who occupies the throne to the first-born of the humblest slave or servant. This last is represented by the handmaid who is behind the mill; since grinding at a mill was regarded as one of the severest and most irksome forms of labour. The work was commonly assigned to captives (Isaiah 47:1, 2; Judges 16:21). It was done by either one or two persons sitting, and consisted in rotating rapidly the upper millstone upon the lower by means of a handle. All the first-born of beasts. Not the first-born of cattle only, but of all beasts. The Egyptians had pet animals in most houses, dogs, apes, monkeys, perhaps cats and ichneumons. Most temples had sacred animals, and in most districts of Egypt, some beasts were regarded as sacred, and might not be killed, their death being viewed as a calamity. The loss of so many animals would consequently be felt by the Egyptians as a sensible aggravation of the infliction. It would wound them both in their domestic and in their religious sensibilities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - There shall be a great cry. The violence of Oriental emotions, and the freedom with which they are vented are well known. Herodotus relates that the Egyptians stript themselves and beat their breasts at funerals (2:85) No doubt they also uttered shrill lamentations, as did the Greeks (Lucian, De Luetu, § 12) and the Persians (Herod. 9:24). With bitter mourning in every house, the \"cry\" might well be one, such as there had been none like before, neither would there be any like again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Shall not a dog move his tongue. So far from a sudden destruction coming upon them, there shall not so much as a dog bark at them- They shall incur no hurt - no danger. (Compare Joshua 10:21.)

Literally, \"shall descend.\" Kalisch observes that by the Hebrew idiom \"going from a nobler place to one of less distinction is called descending\" (Comment. p. 133). And bow down. Make obeisance to me, as if I were a king. The last of the plagues would cause the courtiers to look on Moses as the real king of the land, and pay him royal honours. All the people that follow thee. Literally, as in the margin, \"that is at thy feet;\" i.e., that follows and obeys thee.\" The Egyptians looked on Moses as king, or at any rate prince of his nation. In a great anger. Literally, \"in heat of anger.\" The abrupt dismissal (Exodus 10:28), the threat against his life (ibid.) and the announcement that no more interviews would be granted him moved the indignation of Moses, who was not conscious to himself of having done anything to deserve such treatment. He had answered the king calmly and temperately (Exodus 10:29; Exodus 11:4-8); but knew what his feelings had been, and here records them.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 11:9NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-10. - Before proceeding to relate the last and greatest of the plagues, the author allows himself a momentary pause while he casts his eye back on the whole series of miracles hitherto wrought in Egypt, on the circumstances under which they had been wrought, their failure to move the stubborn will of Pharaoh, and the cause of that failure, the hardening of his heart, which hardening the author once more ascribes to Jehovah. With this summary he terminates the second great division of his work, that which began with ch. 2, and which traces the history of Moses from his birth to the close of his direct dealings with Pharaoh. Verse 9. - And the Lord said. Rather, \"had said.\" God had forewarned Moses that Pharaoh's heart would be hardened (Exodus 4:21; Exodus 7:3), and that, in spite of all the miracles which he was empowered to perform before him, he would not let the people go (Exodus 3:19; Exodus 4:21). It was not until God took Pharaoh's punishment altogether into his own hands, and himself came down and smote all the first-born, that the king's obstinacy was overcome, and he proceeded to \"thrust the people out.\" That my wonders may be multiplied. Compare Exodus 3:20; Exodus 7:3. If Pharaoh had yielded at the first, or even after two or three miracles, God's greatness and power would not have been shown forth very remarkably. Neither the Egyptians nor the neighbouring nations would have been much impressed. The circumstances would soon have been forgotten. As it was, the hardness of Pharaoh's heart, while it delayed the departure of the Israelites for a year, and so added to their sufferings, was of advantage to them in various ways: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. It gave them time to organise them elves, and make all necessary preparations for a sudden departure.NEWLINENEWLINE2. It deeply impressed the Egyptians, and led them to abstain from all interference with the Israelites for above three centuries.NEWLINENEWLINE3.

Aaron's agency is not always mentioned, and seems to have been less marked in the later than in the earlier miracles, Moses gradually gaining self-reliance. In passing from the subject of the plagues wrought by the two brothers, it may be useful to give a synopsis of them, distinguishing those which came without warning from those which were announced beforehand, and noting, where possible, their actual worker, their duration, their physical source, and the hurt which they did.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The Lord spake. - According to the Biblical record, neither Moses nor Aaron introduced any legislation of their own, either at this time or later.

The introduction of these words seems to show that we have here a separate document on the subject of the Passover, written independently of what has preceded, some time after the exodus, and placed here without alteration, when Moses gathered together his various writings into a single work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2 - This month shall be unto you the beginning of months. The Israelite year would seem to have hitherto commenced with the autumnal equinox (Exodus 23:16), or at any rate with the month Tisri (or Ethanim), which corresponded to our October. Henceforth two reckonings were employed, one for sacred, the other for civil purposes, the first month of each year, sacred or civil, being the seventh month of the other. Abib, \"the month of ears\" - our April, nearly - became now the first month of the ecclesiastical year, while Tisri became its seventh or sabbatical month. It is remarkable that neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians agreed with the original Israelite practice, the Egyptians commencing their year with Thoth, or July; and the Babylonians and Assyrians theirs with Nisannu, or April.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Speak ye unto all the congregation. Under the existing circumstances Moses could only venture to summon the elders of Israel to a meeting. He necessarily left it to them to signify his wishes to the people. (See ver. 21.) A lamb. The Hebrew word is one of much wider meaning than our \"lamb.\" It is applicable to both sheep and goats, and to either animal without limit of age, In the present case the age was fixed at a year by subsequent enactment (ver. 5); but the offerer was left free with respect to the species. It is curious that, such being the case, the lamb alone should, so far as appears, ever have been offered. According to the house of their fathers. Literally, \"for a father's house,\" i.e. for a family.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If the household be too little for the lamb - i.e., \"too few to consume it at a sitting.\" Usage in course of time fixed the minimum number at ten. (Joseph. Bell. Jud. 6:9, § 3.) The whole family, men, women and children participated. The lamb was generally slain between the ninth hour (3 p.m.) and the eleventh (5 p.m.). Let him and his neighbour take it according to the number of the souls. If there were a household of only five, which could not possibly consume the lamb, any large neighbouring family was to send five or six of its number, to make up the deficiency. Every man according to his eating, etc. It is difficult to see what sense our translators intended. The real direction is that, in providing a proper number of guests, consideration should be had of the amount which they would be likely to eat. Children and the very aged were not to be reckoned as if they were men in the vigour of life. Translate - \"Each man according to his eating shall ye count towards the lamb.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. Your lamb shall be without blemish. Natural piety would teach that \"the blind, the lame, and the sick\" should not be selected for sacrifice (Malachi 1:8). The Law afterwards expressly forbade any blemished animals - \"blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed\" - to be offered for any of the stated sacrifices, though they might be given as free-will offerings (Leviticus 22:20-25). The absence of blemish was especially important in a victim which was to typify One \"holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners.\" A male. As standing in place of and redeeming the first-born of the males in each family. Of the first year. Perhaps as then more approaching to the ideal of perfect innocence. The requirement was not a usual one. Or from the goats. Theodoret says the proviso was made for the relief of the poorer class of persons; but practically it seems not to have taken effect. When people were poor, their richer neighbours supplied them with lambs (Kalisch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day. The interval of four days (see ver. 3) was probably intended to give ample time for the thorough inspection of the lamb, and for obtaining another, if any defect was discovered. The precept is not observed by the modern Jews; and the later Targum (which belongs to the sixth century after Christ) teaches that it was only intended to apply to the first institution; but the text of Exodus is wholly against this. The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it. One of the main peculiarities of the Paschal sacrifice was this - that the head of each family was entitled - in the early times was required to offer the sacrifice for himself. In it no one intervened between the individual and God. Thus it was recognised that the whole nation was a nation of priests, as are Christians also, according to St. John (Revelation 1:6) and St. Peter (1 Peter 2:5). The intervention of Levites at a late date (2 Chronicles 30:17; 2 Chronicles 35:5, etc.) was contrary to the original institution. In the evening. Literally, \"between the two evenings.\" This phrase has been explained in two ways. Some regard the first evening as commencing when the sun begins visibly to decline from the zenith, i.e. about two or three o'clock; and the second as following the sunset. Others say, that the sunset introduces the first evening, and that the second begins when the twilight ends, which they consider to have been \"an hour and twenty minutes later\" (Ebn Ezra, quoted by Kalisch). The use of the phrase in ch. 16:12, and the command in Deuteronomy 16:6 - \"Thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun,\" seem to be decisive in favour of the second explanation. The first arose out of the later practice. When the lambs were sacrificed in the temple by a continual succession of offerers, it became impossible to complete the sacrifices in the short time originally allowed. Of necessity the work of killing the victims was commenced pretty early in the afternoon, and continued till after sunset. The interpretation of the direction was then altered, to bring it into accord with the altered practice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They shall take of the blood. The blood, which, according to Hebrew ideas, \"is the life,\" and so the very essence of the sacrifice, was always regarded as the special symbol of that expiation and atonement, with a view to which sacrifice was instituted. As by the Paschal sacrifice atonement was made for the house, which was therefore to escape unscathed, the sign of atonement was to be conspicuously placed upon it. And strike. The \"striking\" was to be by means of a bunch of hyssop dipped in the blood (ver. 22). The selection of the doorway as the part of the house to receive the stains of blood is probably to be connected with the idea that the secondary agency producing death, whatever it was, would enter by the door - and if the door showed the house to have been atoned for, would not enter. The upper door-past. The word used is elsewhere translated \"lintel\" (Exodus 12:22, 23); but it seems properly to mean the latticed window which was commonly placed over a doorway in Egyptian houses, and which is often represented in the facades of tombs. (See Lepsius, Denkmaler, pt. 2. pls. 16,17, 147, etc.) It is derived from a root signifying \"to look out.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Roast with fire. The meat of sacrificial meals was commonly boiled by the Hebrews (1 Samuel 2:14, 15). The command to roast the Paschal lamb is accounted for:NEWLINENEWLINE1. By its being a simpler and quicker process than boiling;NEWLINENEWLINE2. By a special sanctity being regarded as attaching to fire;NEWLINENEWLINE3. By the difficulty of cooking the animal whole unless it were roasted. Justin Martyr's statement that for roasting two wooden spits were required, placed at right angles the one to the other, and thus extending the victim on a cross, will seem to many a better ground for the direction than any of these. And unleavened bread. See below, ver. 18. With bitter herbs. Literally, \"with bitternesses.\" That herbs, or vegetables of some kind, are intended, there is no reasonable doubt. The Mishna enumerates endive, chicory, wild lettuce, and nettles among the herbs that might be eaten. It is a strange notion of Kurtz's, that the bitter herbs were a condiment, and \"communicated a more agreeable flavour to the food.\" Undoubtedly they were a disagreeable accompaniment, and represented at once the bitterness of the Egyptian bondage (Exodus 1:14) and the need of self-denial, if we would feed on Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Eat not of it raw. The injunction appears to moderns superfluous; but an ὠμοφαγία, or eating of the raw flesh of victims sacrificed, seems to have been practised by several heathen nations in ancient times, more especially in the worship of Dionysus or Bacchus. Its head with its legs. The lamb was to be roasted whole - according to some, as a symbol of the unity of Israel, and especially of the political unit which they were to become so soon as they quitted Egypt; but, as we learn from St. John (John 19:36), still more to prefigure the unbroken body of Him whom the lamb especially represented, the true propitiation and atonement and deliverer of His people from the destroyer, our Lord Jesus Christ. The purtenance thereof. Rather, \"the intestines thereof.\" The Jewish commentators say that the intestines were first taken out, washed, and cleansed, after which they were replaced, and the lamb roasted in a sort of oven.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning. The whole of the flesh was to be consumed by the guests, and at one sitting, lest there should be any even accidental profanation of the food by man or animal, if part were put away.. The English Church, acting on the same principle of careful reverence, declines to allow any reservation of the Eucharistic elements, requiring the whole of the consecrated bread and wine to be consumed by the Priest and communicants in the Church immediately after the service. That which remaineth - i.e., the bones, and any small fragments of the flesh necessarily adhering to them. Ye shall burn with fire. Thus only could its complete disappearance, and seeming annihilation be secured. It does not appear that this burning was viewed as a sacrificial act.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD'S passover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - With your loins girded, etc. Completely prepared, i.e., to start on your journey - with the loose wrapper (beged), ordinarily worn, collected together and fastened by a girdle about the waist; with sandals on the feet, which were not commonly worn in houses; and with walking-sticks in the hand. There were some Jews who regarded these directions as of perpetual obligation; but the general view was that they applied to the first occasion only, when alone they would have answered any useful purpose. You shall eat it in haste. As not knowing at what moment you may be summoned to start on your journey, and as having to see to the burning of the bones after the flesh was eaten, which would take some time. It is the Lord's Passover. Very emphatic words! \"This is no common meal,\" they seem to say, \"it is not even an ordinary sacrificial repast. The lamb is Jehovah's.

As such view it; and though ye eat it in haste, eat it with reverence.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - For I will pass through, etc. God now proceeds to give the reason for the institution of the new ceremony, and to explain the new term pesach. \"I have commanded this rite,\" He says, \"because I am about to go through the whole land of Egypt as a destroyer, executing judgment; I am about to smite and kill every one of the firstborn both of man and beast. I shall enter into every house, and slay the first-born in it, unless I see upon the house the token of the blood of the lamb. In that ease I shall pass over the house, and you will escape the plague.\" It would clear the sense if the opening words of verse 12 were translated - \"For I shall go through,\" instead of \"pass through.\" The word translated \"pass through\" has no connection at all with that rendered \"pass over.\" Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment. These words are exegetical of the word \"beast,\" which immediately precedes. Animal worship was an important part of the religion of the Egyptians. At four great cities, Memphis, Heliopolis, Hermonthis, a sort of suburb of Thebes, and Momemphis in the Western Delta, animals were maintained, which were viewed as actual incarnations of deity - the Apis Bull at Memphis, a bull called Mnevis at Heliopolis, one termed Bacis or Pacts at Hermonthis, and at Momemphis a White Cow. If any of these were at the time animals that had \"opened the womb,\" death must have fallen upon them. Thus would judgment have been executed, literally, upon Egyptian \"gods.\" But, besides these, the whole country was filled with sacred animals, regarded as emblematic of certain particular deities, and as belonging to them. Sheep were sacred to Kneph, goats to Khem, cows to Athor, cats to Pasht, dogs and jackals to Anubis, lions to Horus, crocodiles to Set and Sabak, hippopotami to Taouris, cynocephalous apes to Thoth, frogs to Heka. A sudden mortality among the sacred animals would be felt by the Egyptians as a blow struck against the gods to whom they belonged, and as a judgment upon them. It is scarcely necessary to understand literally the expression \"all the gods,\" and to defend it by the assertion that \"not a single deity of Egypt but was represented by some beast.\" Such an assertion cannot be proved; and is probably not correct. It has often been remarked, and is generally allowed, that Scripture uses universal expressions, where most, or even many, of a class are meant. I am the Lord. Rather as in Exodus 6:8, \"Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment, I, Jehovah.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The blood shall be to you for a token, etc. The blood was not to be a token to the Israelites, but to God for them. Translate- \"and the blood shall be as a token for you upon the houses that you are there.\" It shall distinguish the houses in which you dwell from the others. I will pass over you. This is the emphatic clause. God would pass by, or over the house on which the blood was, spare it, slay none of its inmates; and from this action of His, the lamb itself, and the feast whereof it was the principal part, were to be termed \"the Passover.\" It has been proposed to connect the Hebrew pesach with the Egyptian pesh, \"to stretch, or extend (protection)\"; but the name \"Tiphsach,\" borne by the place of passage over the Euphrates (1 Kings 4:24), would seem to indicate that \"crossing,\" or \"passing over\" is the primary meaning of the root.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-20. - Hitherto the directions given have had reference, primarily and mainly, if not wholly, to the first celebration of the Passover on the night preceding the Exodus. Now, it is announced,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) That the observance is to be an annual one; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) That it is to he accompanied with certain additional features in the future. These areNEWLINENEWLINE(a) the eating of unleavened bread for seven days after the killing of the Passover;NEWLINENEWLINE(b) the putting away of leaven out of the houses;NEWLINENEWLINE(c)the holding of meetings for worship on the first day and the last; andNEWLINENEWLINE(d) the observance on these days of a sabbatical rest. Verse 14. - This day shall be to you for a memorial. Annual festivals, in commemoration of events believed to have happened, were common in the religion of Egypt, and probably not wholly strange to the religious ideas of the Hebrews. (See the \"Introduction\" to this chapter.) They were now required to make the 14th of Abib such a day, and to observe it continually year after year \"throughout their generations.\" There is commendable faithfulness in the obedience still rendered to the command at the present day; and it must be confessed that the strong expression - throughout your generations and as an ordinance for ever - excuse to a great extent the reluctance of the Jews to accept Christianity. They have already, however, considerably varied from the terms of the original appointment. May they not one day see that the Passover will still be truly kept by participation in the Easter eucharist, wherein Christians feed upon \"the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world\" - the antitype, of which the Paschal lamb was the type - the true sustenance of souls - the centre and source of all real unity - the one \"perfect and sufficient sacrifice, and oblation, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world\"? The Church requires an Easter communion of all her members, proclaims that on that day, Christ our passover being slain, we are to keep the feast; and thus, so far as in her lies, maintains the festival as \"an ordinance for ever,\" to be observed through all her generations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Seven days. There is no indication that the week of seven days was admitted by the ancient Egyptians, or even known to them. Apparently, the nation which first adopted it was that of the Babylonians. Abraham may have brought it with him from \"Ur of the Chaldees;\" and from him it may have passed to Jacob, and so to Moses. That the week was known in the family of Abraham before the giving of the law, appears from Genesis 29:27, 28. Unleavened bread is typical of purity of heart, leaven being an emblem of corruption (Matthew 16:6-12; 1 Corinthians 5:7). \"Leaven,\" says Plutarch, \"comes from corruption, and corrupts the dough with which it is mixed; and every fermentation seems to be a putrefaction.\" The primary command to celebrate the first passover with unleavened instead of leavened bread (ver. 8), must be attributed wholly to this symbolism. But the permanent institution of a \"feast of unleavened bread,\" to last a week, had a double bearing. Partly, it was designed to deepen and intensify the conviction that corruption and impurity disqualify for religions service; but it was also partly intended as a commemoration of the fact, that in their hasty flight from Egypt the bread which they took with them was unleavened (ver. 340, and that they were forced to subsist on this for several days. (Compare the double meaning of the \"bitter herbs, noticed in the comment on verse 8, ad fin.) The requirement to \"put away leaven out of their houses\" is probably intended to teach, that for family worship to he acceptable, the entire household must be pure, and that to effect this result the head of the household must, so far as he can, eject the leaven of sin from his establishment. Whosoever eateth... shall be out off from Israel. Expelled, i.e, from the congregation, or excommunicated. If a man wilfully transgresses any plain precept of God, even though it be a positive one, he should he severed from the Church, until he confess his fault, and repent, and do penance for it. Such was the ', godly discipline\" of the primitive Church; and it were well if the Churches of these modern times had more of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - On the first day there shall be an holy convocation. After the Paschal meal on the evening of the 14th of Abib, there was to be a solemn assembly of the people on the next day for religions worship. The name \"convocation;\" applied to these gatherings, seems to show that originally the people were summoned to such meetings, as they still are by the muezzin from the minarets of mosques in Mahommedan countries, and by bells from the steeples of churches in Christian ones. And on the seventh day. On the 22nd of Abib - the seventh day after the first holy convocation on the 15th (see Leviticus 23:4-8). Only two of the Jewish festivals were of this duration - the feast of unleavened bread, and the feast of tabernacles (ib. 39-42). The Christian Church has adopted the usage for Christmas, Easter, Ascension, and Whitsuntide, where the last day of the week is known technically as \"the octave.\" No manner of work shall be done in them. Festival-days were in all countries days of abstention from the ordinary business of life, which could not conveniently be carried on conjointly with attendance at the services, meetings, processions, etc., wherein the festival consisted. But absolute cessation from all work was nowhere strictly commanded except among the Hebrews, where it appears to have been connected with the belief in God's absolute rest after the six days of creation. The command here given was solemnly repeated in the law (Leviticus 23:6 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In this self-same day. The 15th of Abib - the first day of the feast of unleavened bread. Have I brought your hosts out. This expression seems to prove that we have in the injunctions of verses 14-20, not the exact words of the revelation on the subject made by God to Moses before the institution of the Passover, but a re-casting of the words after the exodus had taken place. Otherwise, the expression must have been, \"I will bring your hosts out.\" As an ordinance for ever. Easter eve, the day on which Satan was despoiled by the preaching of Jesus to the spirits in prison (1 Peter 3:19), and on which the Church first realises its deliverance from the bondage of sin by the Atonement of Good Friday, is the Christian continuance of the first day of unleavened bread, and so answers to this text, as Good Friday to the similar command in ver. 14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - In the first month. The word \"month\" seems to have accidentally dropt out of the Hebrew text. In the evening. The Hebrew day commenced with the evening (Genesis 1:5); but the evening here intended is that at the close of the 14th of Abib, which began the 15th. Similarly, the evening of the 21st is here that which commenced the 22nd.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - This is not a mere \"vain repetition\" of verse 15. It adds an important extension of the punitive clause - \"that soul shall be cut off from Israel\" - from Israelites proper to proselytes. We are thus reminded, at the very time when Israel is about to become a nation and to enter upon its inheritance of exclusive privileges, that no exclusion of the Gentiles by reason of race or descent was ever contemplated by God, either at the giving of the law, or at any other time. In Abraham all the families of them were to be blessed (Genesis 12:3). It was always open to any Gentiles to join themselves to Israel by becoming \"proselytes of justice,\" adopting circumcision and the general observance of the law, and joining the Israelite community. The whole law is full of references to persons of this class (Exodus 20:10; Exodus 23:12; Leviticus 16:29; Leviticus 17:10; Leviticus 18:26; Leviticus 20:2; Leviticus 24:16; Numbers 35:15; Deuteronomy 5:14; Deuteronomy 16:11-14; Deuteronomy 24:17, 19; Deuteronomy 27:19; Deuteronomy 29:11, etc.). It must have been largely recruited in the times immediately following the exodus from the \"mixed multitude\" which accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt (Exodus 12:38), and from the Kenites who joined them in the wilderness (Numbers 10:29-31; Judges 1:16). Born in the land - i.e., an Israelite by birth - \"the land\" is, no doubt, Canaan, which is regarded as the true \"Land of Israel\" from the time when it was assigned by God to the posterity of Abraham (Genesis 15:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Here again there is no repetition, but an extension. \"Ye shall eat nothing leavened,\" not only no leavened bread (ver. 15), but no leavened cake of any kind. And \"in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread,\" i.e., wherever ye dwell, whether in Egypt, or in the wilderness, or in Palestine, or in Babylonia, or in Media, this law shall be observed. So the Jews observe it everywhere to this day, though they no longer sacrifice the Paschal lamb.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:21-28NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21-28. - THE FIRST PASSOVER. Having received the Divine directions as to the new rite, if not with all the fulness ultimately given them, yet with sufficient fulness for the immediate purpose, Moses proceeded to communicate the Divine Will to the people under his protection. Having already aroused the jealousy and hatred of Pharaoh, he could not summon a general assembly of the people, but he ventured to call a meeting of the elders, or heads of principal families, and through them communicated the orders which he had received to the entire nation. We find, in the directions which he gave, two small points which are not comprised in the record of God's words to him.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The designation of the \"hyssop,\" as the instrument, by which the blood was to be placed on the side-posts and lintel (ver. 22); and,NEWLINENEWLINE2. The injunction not to quit the house \"until the morning.\" These points may have been contained in the original directions, though omitted from the record for brevity; or they may have been added by Moses of his own authority. On the other hand, several very main points of the original directions are not repeated in the injunctions given to the elders, though there can be no doubt that they were communicated. Verse 21. - Draw out - i.e., \"Withdraw from the flock.\" (See ver. 3.) A lamb. The word used is generic, and would not exclude the offering of a goat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A bunch of hyssop. The hyssop was regarded as having purging or purifying qualities, and was used in the cleansing of the leper (Leviticus 14:4), and of the leprous house (ibid. 51-52), and also formed an element in the \"water of separation\" (Numbers 19:6). It was a species of plant which grew on walls, and was generally low and insignificant (1 Kings 4:33), yet which could furnish a stick or stalk of some length (John 19:29). It must also have been a common plant in Egypt, the wilderness, and Palestine. Two suggestions are made with respect to it. One, that it was a species of marjoram (Origanum Aegyptiacum, or O. Syriacum) common in both Egypt and Syria; the other that it was the caper plant (Capparis spinosa), which abounds especially in the Desert. (Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 21.) It is in favour of this latter identification, that the modern Arabic name for the caper plant is asaf or asuf, which excellently represents the Hebrew ezob, the word uniformly rendered in our version by \"hyssop\" The blood that is in the basin. The Septuagint and Vulgate render - \"that is on the threshold.\" Saph - the word translated \"basin\" has the double meaning. None of you shall go out. Moses may well have given this advice on his own authority, without any Divine command. (See introductory paragraph.) He would feel that beyond the protection of the blood of the lamb, there was no assurance of safety.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Compare verses 12, 13 which are closely followed. The only important difference is, the new expression, \"The Lord will not suffer the destroyer to come in,\" which has generally been regarded as implying, that the actual agent in the killing of the first-born was a \"destroying angel.\" But it is to be noted that elsewhere Jehovah himself is everywhere spoken of as the sole agent; and that in the present passage the word used has the meaning of \"destruction\" no less than that of \"destroyer.\" Bishop Lowth's idea of an opposition between God and the destroying angel (Comment on Isaiah 31:5) is scarcely tenable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. To thee and to thy children. The change from the plural to the singular is curious, Perhaps, we are to understand that Moses insisted on the perpetuity of the ordinance to each of the elders severally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised. See above, Exodus 3:8-17; Exodus 6:4; and compare Genesis 17:8; Genesis 28:4, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - When your children shall say unto you, what mean ye by this service. Apparently, Moses adds these injunctions by his own sole authority. He assumes that curiosity will be aroused by the strange and peculiar features of the Paschal ceremony, and that each generation in succession will wish to know its meaning and origin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - It is the sacrifice. It has been denied that the Paschal lamb was, in the true sense of the word, a sacrifice (Carpzov and others). But this passage alone is decisive on the question, and proves that it was. Moreover, it was offered in the holy place (Deuteronomy 16:5, 6 ); the blood of it was sprinkled upon the altar, and the fat was burnt (2 Chronicles 30:16; 2 Chronicles 35:11). Compare also Exodus 23:18; Numbers 9:7; Deuteronomy 16:2. The people bowed the head and worshipped. Rather, \"and made obeisance.\" Compare Exodus 4:31. By \"the people\" seems to be meant \"the elders of the people.\" (See ver. 21.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - So did they. The long series of miracles wrought by Moses and Aaron had so impressed the people, that they yielded an undoubting and ready obedience.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:29, 30NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - THE TENTH PLAGUE. At last the time had come for the dealing of the final blow. Nine plagues had been sent, nine inflictions endured, and no serious effect had been produced. Once or twice Pharaoh had wavered, had made profession of submitting himself, had even acknowledged his sin. But each time he had relapsed into obstinacy. Now at length the fiat had gone forth for that last plague which had been announced the first (Exodus 4:23). Pharaoh's own son, his firstborn, the heir to his throne, was smitten with death, in common with all the other male Egyptians who had \"opened the womb.\" What the effect on the king would have been, had he alone suffered, we cannot certainly say. As it was, the whole population of the country, nobles, tradesmen, peasants, suffered with him; and the feeling aroused was so intense that the popular movement left him no choice. The Egyptians everywhere \"rose up in the night\" (ver. 30), and raised \"a great cry,\" and insisted that the Israelites should depart at once (ver. 33). Each man feared for himself, and felt his life insecure, so long as a single Israelite remained in the land. Verse 29. - At midnight. As prophesied by Moses (Exodus 11:4). The day had not been fixed, and this uncertainty must have added to the horror of the situation. The first-born of Pharaoh. We have no proof that the eldest son of Menephthah died before his father, unless we take this passage as proving it. He left a son, called Seti-Menephthah, or Seti II, who either succeeded him, or reigned after a short interval, during which the throne was held by Ammonmes, a usurper. The first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon. This phrase takes the place of another expression, viz. \"the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill\" (Exodus 11:5). In both cases, the general meaning is, \"all, from the highest to the lowest.\" This is perhaps the whole that is in the writer's thought; but it is also true that captives in dungeons were in some cases employed in turning hand-mills (Judges 16:21). And all the first-born of cattle. Rather, \"of beasts.\" There is no limitation of the plague to domesticated animals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, and all his servants. This general disturbance differentiates the present visitations from that which came upon the host of Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:35). Then, the calamity came with such silence and secrecy, that the deaths were not suspected until men rose to go about their various tasks in the morning Now, every household seems to have been aroused from its sleep in the night. We must suppose sharp and painful illness, terminating after a few hours in death. The disaster itself may have been one from which Egypt often suffers in the spring of the year (Kalisch); but its attacking all the firstborn and no others, and no Israelites, as well as its announcement, plainly showed it to be miraculous. There was a great cry. See the comment on Exodus 11:6. For there was not a house where there was not one dead. This is perhaps a slight hyperbole. There would be many families in which there was no son; and some houses might contain no male who had opened the womb. It is always to be borne in mind, that the language of Scripture - especially where exciting and tragical events are narrated - is poetical, or at the least highly rhetorical.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:31-36NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-36. - THE DISMISSAL The first action seems to have been taken by Pharaoh. The \"cry\" of the people had no doubt been heard in the palace, and he was aware that the blow had not fallen on himself alone, and may have anticipated what the people's feelings would be; but he did not wait for any direct pressure to be put upon him before yielding. He sent his chief officers (Exodus 11:8) while it was still night (Exodus 12:31), to inform Moses and Aaron, not only that they might, but that they must take their departure immediately, with all the people, and added that they might take with them their flocks and herds. The surrender was thus complete; and it was accompanied by a request which we should scarcely have expected. Pharaoh craved at the hands of the two brothers a blessing! We are not told how his request was received; but that it should have been made is a striking indication of how his pride was humbled. The overture from Pharaoh was followed rapidly by a popular movement, which was universal and irresistible. The Egyptians \"rose up\" everywhere, and \"were urgent upon the people,\" to \"send them out of the land in haste\" (ver. 33); and to expedite their departure readily supplied them at their request with gold and silver and raiment (ver. 35), thus voluntarily spoiling themselves for the benefit of the foreigners. The Israelites, long previously prepared for the moment which had now arrived, made their final arrangements, and before the day was over a lengthy column was set in motion, and proceeded from Rameses, which seems to have been a suburb of Tunis (Brugsch, Hist. of Egypt, vol. 2. pp. 96-99), to an unknown place called Succoth, which must have lain towards the south-east, and was probably not very remote from the capital Verse 31. - And he called for Moses and Aaron. Kalisch understands this as a summons to the King's presence (Commentary, p. 130), and even supposes that the two brothers complied, notwithstanding what Moses had said (Exodus 10:29). But perhaps no more is meant than at Pharaoh's instance Moses and Aaron were summoned to an interview with some of the Court officials (see Exodus 11:8). As ye have said. Literally, \"according to your words.\" The reference is to such passages as Exodus 8:1, 20; Exodus 9:1, 13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Also take your flocks and your herds. Pharaoh thus retracted the prohibition of Exodus 10:24, and \"gave the sacrifices and burnt-offerings\" which Moses had required (ib. ver. 25). Bless me also. Pharaoh was probably accustomed to receive blessings from his own priests, and had thus been led to value them. His desire for a blessing from Moses and Aaron, ere they departed, probably sprang from a conviction - based on the miracles which he had witnessed - that their intercession would avail more with God than that of his own hierarchy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. The Egyptians were urgent upon the people. The Egyptians feared that, if any further delay took place, the God of the Hebrews might not be content with slaying all the first-born, but might punish with death the whole nation, or at any rate all the males. It is easy to see how their desire to get rid of the Israelites would expedite matters, and enable all to set out upon the journey on the same day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The people took their dough. They probably regarded dough as more convenient for a journey than flour, and so made their flour into dough before starting; but they had no time to add leaven. Their kneading-troughs. This rendering is correct, both here and in the two other places where the word occurs (Exodus 8:3, and Deuteronomy 28:5). Kneading-troughs would be a necessity in the desert, and, if like those of the modern Arabs, which are merely small wooden bowls, would be light and portable. The dough and kneading-troughs, with perhaps other necessaries, were carried, as the Arabs still carry many small objects, bound up in their clothes (i.e., in the beged or ample shawl) upon their shoulders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses. See above, Exodus 11:2. They borrowed. On this mistranslation, see the comment upon Exodus 3:22. It is plain that the gold and silver articles and the raiment, were free-will gifts, which the Egyptians never expected to see again, and which the Hebrews asked and took, but in no sense \"borrowed.\" Hengstenberg and Kurtz have shown clearly that the primary meaning of the words translated \"borrowed\" and \"lent,\" is \"asked\" and \"granted,\" and that the sense of \"borrowing\" and \"lending\" is only to be assigned them when it is required by the context.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - So that they lent unto them such things as they required. Rather, \"So that they granted them what they asked.\" They spoiled the Egyptians. See the comment on Exodus 3:22, ad fin. The result was that the Israelites went forth, not as slaves, but as conquerors, decked with the jewels of the Egyptians, as though they had conquered and despoiled themNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:37-39NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 37-39. - THE DEPARTURE. There are, no doubts, great difficulties in conceiving the departure on one day, from one place, of \"six hundred thousand that were men, beside children.\" The difficulty is increased when we find (from Numbers 1:3-43) that by \"men\" is meant males above twenty years of age. The entire body of Israelites is thus raised from over half a million to over two millions. The whole narrative, however, supposes some such number; and it is accepted by the best critics, as Ewald, Kalisch, Kurtz, Canon Cook, and others. As these two millions must have lived dispersed over a considerable space, and there could have been no advantage in their all assembling at Rameses (Tunis), we are probably to suppose the main body with Moses and Aaron to have stared from that place, while the others, obeying orders previously given, started from all parts of Goshen, and converged upon Succoth, which was the first rendezvous. Each body of travellers was accompanied by its flocks and herds, and followed by a number of slaves, dependants, and sympathisers not of Hebrew birth (ver. 38), which still further enlarged their numbers. The extremely open character of the country, and the firmness of the soil at the time of year, would facilitate the journey. There was no marching along roads, which indeed did not exist. Each company could spread itself out at its pleasure, and go its own pace. All knew the point of meeting, and marched towards it, in converging lines, there being no obstacle to hinder them. Arrived in the vicinity of Succoth, they could bivouac without hurt, in that fine climate, in the open air. Verse 37. - From Rameses. It has been doubted whether this \"Rameses\" is the same place as the \"Raamses\" of Exodus 1:11. But the doubt scarcely seems to be reasonable. The two words differ only in the pointing. Brugsch has clearly shown that Rameses (Pa-Ramesu) was a town newly built in the reign of Rameses II., partly erected by himself, in the immediate vicinity of the old city of Tanis or Zoan. It was the favourite capital of both Rameses II. and Menephthah. (See Brugsch, Hist. of Egypt, vol. 2. pp. 96 and 128.) Succoth. The meaning of the word \"Succoth\" is \"booths.\" Mr. Greville Chester tells us that \"huts made of reeds\" are common at the present day in the tract south-east of Tunis, and suggests that the Succoth here mentioned may have been at Salahiyeh, fifteen miles due south of Tunis. Tel-Defneh, at the same distance to the south-east, is perhaps a more probable site. Six hundred thousand. See the Introductory paragraph. At the time of the numbering recorded in Numbers 1, the males above twenty years of age were 625,550. Beside children. Rather, \"beside families.\" The word used includes all the women, and the children under twenty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - A mixed multitude went up also with them. Kalisch supposes that these strangers were native Egyptians, anxious to escape the tyranny of the kings. Canon Cook suggests that they were \"remains of the old Semitic population\" of the Eastern provinces. Perhaps it is more probable that they consisted of fugitives from other subject races (as the Shartana) oppressed by the Pharaohs. We have again mention of this \"mixed multitude\" in Numbers 11:4, where we find that they were the first to regret the \"flesh and the fish, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlick\" which they had eaten in Egypt freely (ib. 5). They thus set a bad example, which the Israelites followed. And flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. Compare Exodus 10:26. It has been noticed that this is important, as lessening the difficulties connected with the sustentation of the Israelites in the wilderness. But it increases, on the other hand, the difficulties connected with the march, and with the possibility of finding pasture for such large flocks and herds in the Sinaitic peninsula.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. Unleavened cakes. Some of the modern Arabs make such cakes by simply mixing flour with water, and attaching flat circular pieces of the dough thus formed to the sides of their ovens after they have heated them. (Niebuhr, Description de l'Arabie,?. 45, and pl. 1, F.) Others put a lump of dough into the ashes of a wood fire, and cover it over with the embers for a short time (Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, p. 288). All Arab bread is unleavened. They were thrust out of Egypt. Compare ver. 33.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:40-42NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 40-42. - The narrative of the departure from Egypt is followed, not unnaturally, by a notification of the length of the sojourn, which is declared to have been a space of four hundred and thirty years. In the \"Introduction\" to the Book, we have examined the question, which here arises,NEWLINENEWLINE1. As to the soundness; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. As to the true meaning, of the Hebrew text, and have arrived at the conclusion that it is sound, and that it means what it says, viz., that 430 years elapsed between the arrival of Jacob in Egypt, with his sons, and sons' sons, and their families, as related in Genesis 46:1-27, and the commencement of the exodus. The time is required by the genealogy of Joshua (1 Chronicles 7:22-27). It is in remarkable accordance with the traditions that Joseph was the minister of Apspi, and that the Jews went out under Menephthah. If not absolutely required for the multiplication of the race from \"seventy souls\" to above two millions, it is at any rate more in accord with that fact than the alternative number, 215. It is twice repeated, so that \"the mistake of a copyist\" is almost impossible. Verse 40. - The sojourning of the children of Israel, which dwelt in Egypt. Rather, \"Which they sojourned in Egypt.\" (Compare the Septuagint - ἡ κατοίκησις η{ν κατῴκησαν.) Four hundred and thirty years. Literally \"thirty years and four hundred years.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - The self-same day... all the hosts went out. The setting forth upon the journey is regarded as the \"going out\" - not the actual exit, which was only effected by the passage of the Red Sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - It is a night to be much observed. We must suppose that some of the Israelites actually commenced their march before the night was over, being \"hastened\" by the Egyptians (ver. 33), and having all things in readiness; but the bulk of the people can scarcely have started before daybreak. This is that night of the Lord - i.e., the night concerning which directions had been already given (vers. 6-11) - the only \"night\" for which any observances were appointed. In their generations. To all time - so long as they continue to be a people. On the bindingness of this commandment, see the comment on ver. 14 of this chapter.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 12:43-51NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 43-51. - SUPPLEMENTARY ORDINANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PASSOVER. The position of these verses is curious. We should have expected them to have followed immediately on ver. 20, or else to have been reserved for the further consideration of the subject in ch. 23. It is suggested, in order to account for their place, that they formed the matter of a special revelation made to Moses at Succoth. They comprise three main points: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The absolute exclusion of all uncircumcised persons from participation in the passover rite;NEWLINENEWLINE2. The extension of the rite (implied in ver. 19) to all full proselytes; and,NEWLINENEWLINE3. The injunction that not a bone of the lamb should be broken. (This last is repeated in Numbers 9:12) Verses 43. - This is the ordinance of the passover - i.e., \"This is the law, in respect of the persons who are to partake of it\" - there shall no stranger eat thereof, or literally, \"No son of a stranger shall eat thereof.\" By a \"stranger\" here is meant one of a foreign race who wishes to retain his foreign character and to remain uncircumcised. Compare ver. 48.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Every man's servant that is bought for money. Or \"every man's slave.\" The Mosaic Law found servitude existing, and left it existing, only guarding against its extreme abuses (Exodus 21:20-27). It put no check on the traffic in slaves. When thou hast circumcised him. The Jewish commentators say, that the desire of the slave to receive the rite and become a Jew is here implied. But it would seem rather, that opposition and refusal is not thought of as possible (see Genesis 17:13, 17). The case is like that of baptism among the barbarous nations, where no sooner was the king converted than a general order went forth for the baptism of his subjects, which no one thought of resisting. Then shall he eat thereof. It was a principle of the Jewish law that the slaves should be admitted to complete religious equality with the native Israelites. (compare Leviticus 22:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - A foreigner. Literally \"a so-journer\" - i.e., a foreigner who is merely passing through the land, or staying for a time, without intending to become a permanent resident. The Septuagint πάροικος well expresses the meaning. An hired servant. It is assumed that the \"hired servant\" will be a foreigner; and intended to guard against any compulsion being put upon him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - In one house shall it be eaten. Compare the directions in vers. 3-10, which imply this, and see the comment on ver. 10. Neither shall ye break a bone of it. Kalisch thinks that the lamb was a symbol of the unity of the nation, and was therefore not to have any of its bones broken. This view may be a true one, without being exhaustive. It may have been to mark the unity of the Church in Christ that his bones were not broken, and in view especially of that unity, that the type was made to correspond in this particular with the antitype. (See John 19:33-36.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the congregation of Israel shall keep it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - All the congregation ... shall keep it.

The \"stranger,\" even if he only \"sojourned\" in the land, was to be put on exactly the same spiritual footing as the Israelite (\"One law shall be,\" etc.) if only he and his would be circumcised, and so enter into covenant,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - Thus did all the children of Israel - i.e., the Israelites, at their first passover, acted in accordance with these precepts, especially in admitting to the feast all circumcised persons, whether natives or foreigners, and rejecting all the uncircumcised.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus12:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - This verse should be transferred to the commencement of the next chapter, which should run as follows: - \"And it came to pass - on the self-same day that the Lord brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies - that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,\" etc. The word \"armies,\" which at first sight may seem inappropriate, occurs also in ch. 6:26. It is probably intended to mark that the people were thoroughly organised, and marshalled in divisions resembling those of an army.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-16. - SANCTIFICATION OF THE FIRSTBORN. In connection with the deliverance from death of the Israelite first-born by the blood of the lamb, and still further to fix the remembrance of the historical facts in the mind of the nation, Moses was commissioned to declare all the firstborn of Israel for all future time, and all the firstborn of their domesticated animals \"holy to the Lord.\" There was, perhaps, already in the minds of men a feeling that peculiar dignity attached to the first-born in each family; and this feeling was now strengthened by the assignment to them of a sacred character. God claimed them, and also the first-born of beasts, as His own. The clean beasts became his by sacrifice; but the unclean ones could not he similarly treated, and therefore had to be \"redeemed\" (verse 13) by the sacrifice of clean animals in their place. The first-born of men became at the first institution of the new ordinance God's ministers; but as this system was not intended to continue, it was announced that they too would have to be \"redeemed\" (verses 13, 15). The exact mode of redeeming them was left to be settled afterwards, and will be found in Numbers 3:40-51; Numbers 18:16. Verse 1. - On the true grammatical nexus of this verse, see note on Exodus 12:51. The injunctions of verse 2, and probably those of 3-15 - were given to Moses on the very day of the setting-forth, most likely, at Succoth in the evening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Sanctify unto me. Not by any positive ceremony, but by regarding it as \"set apart unto the Lord\" (verse 12) - made over to him, that is, as his own. All the first-born. The Hebrew word used is masculine, and by its proper force limits the command to the first-born males, who alone had been in danger from the tenth plague. Whatever openeth the womb. This clause added definiteness, showing that \"first-born\" did not contain any reference to any later Birth, and that it applied to every case where a woman's first child was a male. It is mine. Or, \"it shall be mine.\" I claim it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And Moses said. Without relating the directions given to Moses any further, the author passes to the directions given by him. He thus, here and elsewhere, avoids unnecessary repetition. Remember this day. The injunction came with great force at the close of the first day's journey, when the good-will of the Egyptians had been shown, and the people had been helped and speeded on their way, and felt that they were actually quitting the house of their bondage, and setting out for Canaan. By strength of hand the Lord brought you out - i.e.., \"by His powerful protection has God brought you on your way thus far.\" Therefore, \"Remember this day, and remember that nothing leavened is to be eaten on it\" (see Exodus 12:15-20). Ver 4. - In the month Abib. The name of the month had not been previously mentioned. Some have derived it from the Egyptian Epiphi. As, however, ab means \"greenness\" in Hebrew, and abib \"green ears of corn,\" while ibba meant \"fruit\" in Chaldee (Daniel 4:12, 14), and abbon means \"green herbs\" in Arabic, there is no need of a foreign derivation for the word. The month of \"greenness,\" or of \"green ears of corn,\" would be both appropriate and intelligible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis day came ye out in the month Abib.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The land of the Canaanites, etc. Compare Exodus 3:8, 17. The six nations of these passages are reduced here to five by the omission of the Perizzites, one of the less important tribes. Which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. See Genesis 15:18; Genesis 24:7; and compare the comment on Exodus 6:8. That thou shalt keep this service.

There can be no doubt that the Jewish system of tephillin, or \"phylacteries,\" grew mainly out of this passage, and was intended as a fulfilment of the commands contained in it. The tephillin were strips of parchment with passages of Scripture written upon them and deposited in small boxes, which were fastened by a strap either to the left arm, or across the forehead. The modern Jews argue that they were what Moses here intended, and that their employment began from this time. Some Christian commentators agree with them. But the great majority argue, from supposed probability and from the entire absence of any reference to the actual wearing of tephillin in the Old Testament, that the custom must be, comparatively speaking, a modern one. It is generally supposed to have originated, with other superstitious practices, in the time of the Babylonish captivity. Those who take this view regard the words of Moses in the present passage as merely metaphorical, and compare them with Proverbs 3:3; Proverbs 6:21; Proverbs 7:3. Kalisch, however, observes with reason, that if the injunction to write passages of the Law on the door-posts of their houses (Deuteronomy 6:9; Deuteronomy 11:20) was intended to be understood literally, and was literally carried out (Isaiah 57:8), the commands with respect to tephillin, which are coupled with them (Deuteronomy 6:8; Deuteronomy 11:18) must have been similarly intended. And probability, which is said to be against the Mosaic origin of tephillin, may perhaps rather be urged in its favour. The Egyptian practice Of wearing as amulets \"forms of words written on folds of papyrus tightly rolled up and sewn in linen\" (Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. 3. p. 364) is well attested. Would it not be in harmony with the general character of his legislation, that Moses should adopt and regulate the custom, employing it to do honour to the Law and keep it in remembrance, without perhaps purging it wholly from superstitious ideas? Moses allowed the Israelites in many things \"for the hardness of their hearts,\" content if he could introduce some improvement without insisting at once on an impracticable perfection. That the law of the Lord may be in thy month. The Israelites are instructed from the first, that the tephillin are to be a means to an end; and that the end is to be the retention of God's law in their recollection - \" in their mouth,\" and therefore in their heart, since \"out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This ordinance.

The expression is especially appropriate to the case of first-born animals, which would have to be separated off from the rest of the flock, or of the herd, and \"put aside\" for Jehovah, so as not to be mixed up and confounded with the other lambs, kids, and calves. The males shall be the Lord's. This limitation, implied in verse 2, is here brought prominently into notice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Every firstling of an ass. The ass was the sole beast of burthen taken by the Israelites out of Egypt. (See Exodus 20:17.) Neither the horse nor the camel was among their possessions in the wilderness. This is agreeable to the Egyptian monuments, by which the camel appears to have been rare in Egypt at this time, and the horse as yet mainly used for war and by the nobles in their chariots. With a lamb. A lamb or a kid. The word used is the generic one. (See the comment on Exodus 12:3.) If thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. This enactment was evidently made to prevent a refusal to redeem. It would not require to be put in force, since by refusing under such a penalty a man would suffer pecuniary loss. All the first-born of men among thy children. Rather \"among thy sons.\" Shalt thou redeem. Later on, the amount of the redemption money was fixed at five shekels of the sanctuary for each. (Numbers 3:47.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - When thy son asketh thee.

Bather, \"when Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go.\" At his last interview with Moses, Pharaoh had absolutely refused to let them go with their cattle (Exodus 10:24-27), and Moses had absolutely refused to go without them. I sacrifice all that openeth the womb, being males. And being clean animals. The common sense of the reader or hearer, is expected to supply the restriction. Of my children. Rather, as in verse 13, \"of my sons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - A sign... frontlets. See the comment on verse 9. It is the custom among the Jews to write this entire passage - Exodus 13:1-16 - on two of the four strips of parchment contained in the tephillin. The others have inscribed on them Deuteronomy 6:4-9, and Deuteronomy 11:13-21.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 13:17-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17-20. - THE DIRECTION OF THE JOURNEY. - The direct road from Tanis to Palestine - a road much frequented under the nineteenth dynasty - lay along the coast of the Mediterranean, and conducted to Philistia. If we look at the map, and observe the position of Tanis (now San) on the old Tanitic branch of the Nile, now nearly dried up, we shall see that the route which would naturally suggest itself to any one wishing to proceed to the Holy Land from Tanis would be one running almost due east, from Tanis to Pelusium, and from Pelusium, south of Lake Serbonis, to Rhinocolura; and thence, following the course of the coast to Gaza, Ascalon, and Ashdod, the chief towns of the Philistine country. It is true that a marsh region intervenes between Tanis and Pelusium which might seem to bar the route; but the Egyptian remains show that, in the times of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, this obstacle was surmounted by means of an embankment which was carried across it, and that a direct road thus connected the two cities. Moses, at this point of his narrative, being about to trace the onward march of the Israelites from Succoth to Etham, in the direction of the Red Sea, anticipated, it would seem, an objection on the part of his reader, who would naturally ask, Why was not the direct route eastward taken and Canaan entered on the south-west after some half-dozen marches? In verses 17, 18, he gives the reply -NEWLINENEWLINE1. God led them, they did not determine their own route; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. God would not lead them by the direct route, because it would have conducted them to the Philistine country, and the Philistines were strong, and would have resisted the invasion by force of arms. Hence it was that the southern or south-eastern route was taken in preference to the northern one - and that the second stage in the journey was from Succoth to Etham (verse 20). Verse 17. - Although that was near. Rather \"because it was near\" (ὅτι ἐγγὺς ῆν, LXX.) - i.e.., \"God did not, because it was near, lead them this way, but a longer one.\" Lest peradveature the people repeat when they see war. The Philistines were a powerful and warlike race half a century after this, in the time of Joshua, and were masters of the five important cities of Gaze, Ascalon, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron, which seem to have formed a confederacy (Joshua 13:3). It would appear that their strength was already considerable, and that the Israelites, though perhaps more numerous, were incapable of coping with them, being wholly unaccustomed to war, The Israelites were therefore not allowed to take this route, which would have brought upon them at once a severe trial, and might have led to their voluntary return into Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - God led the people about. Or \"led the people a circuit,\" i.e., made them take a circuitous route to Canaan, the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea - i.e., by the southern wilderness, or what is now called \"the wilderness of Sinai.\" Kalisch shows the wisdom of this course - how it gave time for the nation to be \"gradually accustomed to fatigues and hardships by a long and tiresome march in the desert\" - to learn obedience to their chief - and finally to be \"trained to military discipline and martial, virtue by occasional expeditions against the weaker tribes of the desert.\" He errs, however, in ascribing the wisdom of the course taken to Moses, since Moses expressly declares that the conception was not his, but God's. And the children of Israel went up harnessed. The word here translated \"harnessed,\" is generally thought to mean either \"with their loins girded\" (Onkelos, Kimchi, Kalisch) or \"in military order\" (Gesenius, Lee, Knobel). Ewald, who inclines to the latter of these two senses, suggests that, strictly, it means \"in five divisions\" - viz., van, centre, two wings, and rearguard. The word is, apparently, a derivative from khamesh, \"five.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Moses took the bones of Joseph - i.e., his body, which had been embalmed, and deposited in a mummy case (Genesis 50:26), most probably at Tanis, which was the capital of the Shepherd kings, no less than of Menephthah. He had straitly sworn the children of Israel. See Genesis 50:25. Joseph, firmly believing in the promise of God to give Canaan to the descendants of Abraham had made them swear to take his body with them when they left Egypt. The desire to be laid in their native earth was common to most of the nations of antiquity, and, in the case of the Israelites, was intensified by Canaan being the \"laud of promise.\" Jacob had had the same feeling as Joseph, and had been buried by Joseph in the cave of Math-pelah (Genesis 50:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And they took their journey from Succoth and encamped in Etham. On the probable position of Etham, see the \"Introduction\" to this book. The word probably means \"House of Turn,\" and implies the existence at the place of a temple of the Sun-God, who was commonly worshipped as Tuna or Atum. The name, therefore, is nearly equivalent to Pithom (Exodus 1:11), which means \"City of Turn;\" but it is not likely that Moses designated the same place by two distinct appellations. The site of Etham, moreover, does not agree with that of the Patumos of Herodotus (2:158), which is generally allowed to be Pithom.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 13:21, 22NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD AND OF FIRE. Having stated, in verse 17, that \"God led the Israelites,\" and determined their route for them, the writer here proceeds to explain how this leading was accomplished. With extreme simplicity and directness he states, that the conduct was effected by means of an appearance, which in the daytime was like a column or pillar of smoke ascending from earth to heaven, and in the night was like a pillar of fire. He considers the presence of God to have been in the pillar, which moved in front of the host, and showed them the way that they were to go. When it halted, they halted when it advanced, they advanced. Their journeys being made as much in the night-time as in the day, on account of the intense heat, the pillar took in the night the appearance of a column of fire, so as to be equally visible as by day. All attempts to give a rational explanation of the phenomenon are misplaced, since the writer, from whom alone we derive our information on the subject, clearly regarded it as miraculous; and both here and elsewhere (Exodus 14:19, 20, 24; Exodus 33:9; Numbers 12:5; Numbers 14:11) speaks of it as a form under which God was pleased to show himself. There is little doubt that fire and smoke signals were already used by commanders of armies for much the same purpose as that which God now accomplished in this way. The Egyptian documents of the period contain indications of the usage; and it is found among the Arabians, the Greeks, and the Persians. (See especially Q. Curt. Vit. Alex. 5:2; \"Perticam, quae undique conspici posset, supra praetorium statuit, ex qua signum eminebat pariter omnibus conspicuum: observabatur ignis noctu, fiunus interdin.\") The miracle was thus, in a certain sense, founded upon an existing custom, with the difference that God here gave the signals miraculously, which were wont to be given in a natural way by the human leaders of armies. He thus constituted himself the general of the host. Verse 21. - The Lord went before them. From Succoth at any rate; perhaps even on the journey from Rameses to Succoth. In a pillar of cloud. The pillar was seen - the presence of Jehovah, though unseen, was believed to be in it, and to move it. To go by day and night. Or, \"so that they might march both by day and by night.\" Night marches are generally preferred by Orientals on account of the great heat of the days. The night-marches of the Israelites are again mentioned in Numbers 9:21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He took not away. The last distinct mention of the cloud is in Numbers 16:42, after the destruction of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. There is perhaps a later allusion to it in Numbers 20:6. In Nehemiah it is said that \"the pillar of the cloud departed not from them,\" so long as they were in the wilderness (Nehemiah 9:19); and the same is implied, though not formally stated, in Numbers 9:15-23. There is no mention of the pillar of the cloud as still with the Israelites in the Book of Joshua. Probably it was last seen on the journey from Beth-jesimoth to Abel-Shittim in the rich Jordan valley (Numbers 33:49).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.14":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - THE DIRECTION OF THE JOURNEY CHANGED. Hitherto the march of the Israelites had been to the south-east. Another day's journey in this direction would have taken them beyond the limits of Egypt, into the desert region east of the Bitter Lakes, which was dry, treeless, and waterless. In this tract there would have been but scant nourishment for their flocks and herds, and absolutely no water for themselves, unless it had been obtained by miracle. God therefore changed the direction of their route from south-east to due south, and made them take a course by which they placed the Bitter Lakes on their left hand, and so remained within the limits of Egypt, in a district fairly well watered, but shut off from the wilderness by the Bitter Lakes and the northern prolongation of the Gulf of Suez, with which they were connected. This route suited the immediate convenience of the host; and, having no suspicion of any hostile movement on the part of the Egyptians, they - not unnaturally - made no objection to it. It had, however, the disadvantage, in case of a hostile movement, of shutting them in between their assailants on the one hand, and the sea upon the other; and this circumstance seems to have led Pharaoh to make his pursuit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn. Kalisch translates \"return\" - i.e., \"retrace their steps,\" and supposes that Etham lay far south of Pihahiroth, on the west coast of the Gulf of Suez. But the Hebrew word means either \"turn back\" or \"turn aside,\" and is translated here ἀποστρέψαντες and not ἀναστρέψαντες by the LXX. Dr. Brugsch supposes that the turn made was to the north, and the \"sea\" reached the Mediterranean; but all other writers, regarding the sea spoken of as the Red Sea (compare Exodus 13:18), believe the divergence from the previous route to have been towards the south, and place Pihahiroth, Migdol, and Baal-Zephon in this quarter. Pihahiroth. The exact position is nnknown. Neither the Egyptian remains nor the writings of the Greeks or Romans present us with any similar geographic name. If Semitic, the word should mean \"the entrance to the caves,\" but it is quite possible that it may be Egyptian. Migdol. There was undoubtedly a famous Migdol, or Maktal, on the eastern frontier of Egypt, which was a strong fortified post, and which is often mentioned. Hecataeus called it Magdolos (Fr. 282). In the Itinerary of Antonine it is said to be twelve Roman miles from Pelusium (p. 76). But this is too northern a position for the Migdol of the present passage; which must represent a \"tower\" or \"fortified post\" not very remote from the modern Suez. Over against Baal-Zephon. The accumulation of names, otherwise unknown to the sacred writers, is a strong indication of the familiarity possessed by the author of Exodus with the geography of the country. No late writer could have ventured on such local details. A name resembling \"Baal-Zephon\" is said to occur in the Egyptian monuments. Dr. Brugsch reads it as \"Baal-Zapuna.\" He regards it as the designation of a Phoenician god, and compares \"Baal-Zebub.\" Others have compared the \"Zephon\" with the Graeco-Egyptian form \"Typhon,\" and have supposed \"Baal-Zephon\" to be equivalent to \"Baal-Set\" or \"Baal. Sutech\" - a personification of the principle of evil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They are entangled in the land. Or \"they are confused,\" \"perplexed\" - i.e.. \"they have lost their way.\" Pharaoh could not conceive that they would have taken the route to the west of the Bitter Lakes, which conducted to no tolerable territory, unless they were hopelessly at sea with respect to the geography of the country. In this \"perplexity\" of theirs he thought he saw his own opportunity. The wilderness hath shut them in. Pharaoh is thinking of his own \"wilderness,\" the desert country between the Nile valley and the Red Sea. This desert, he says, \"blocks their way, and shuts them in \" - they cannot escape if he follows in their steps, for they will have the sea on one hand, the desert on the other, and in their front, while he himself presses upon their rear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD.

A short respite from suffering was sufficient to enable Pharaoh to recover from his extreme alarm. No further deaths had followed on the destruction of the firstborn; and he might think no further danger was to be apprehended. The worst of Moses' threats had been accomplished- perhaps Jehovah had no more arrows in his quiver. At any rate, as he realised to himself what it would be to lose altogether the services of so vast a body of slaves, many of them highly skilled in different arts, he more and more regretted the permission which he had given. Under these circumstances intelligence was brought him of the change which the Israelites had made in their route, and the dangerous position into which they had Brought themselves. Upon this he resolved to start in pursuit, with such troops as he could hastily muster. As his chariots were six hundred, we may presume that his footmen were at least 100,000, all trained and disciplined soldiers, accustomed to warfare. The timid horde of escaped slaves, unused to war, though it might be five or six times as numerous as his host, was not likely to resist it. Pharaoh no doubt expected an unconditional surrender on the part of the Israelites, as soon as they saw his forces. Verse 5. - It was told the King of Egypt that the people fled. Pharaoh, when he let the Israelites go, must have felt tolerably certain that they would not voluntarily return. Formally, however, he had only consented to their going a three days' journey into the wilderness (Exodus 12:31). When, being at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness, they did not enter it, but marched southward to Pi-hahiroth, the Egyptians might naturally report that instead of sacrificing, they were flying - hasting forwards - placing as much distance as they could between themselves and the Egyptian headquarters. But this report alone would scarcely have moved Pharaoh to action. It was in the accompanying circumstances, in the particular line of route, that he thought to find his opportunity. The people \"were entangled\" (ver. 3). They might be taken at a disadvantage, and might be reduced to choosing between starvation and a. return to Egypt. The heart of Pharaoh, and of his servants, was turned against the people. The reaction of feeling was not confined to Pharaoh. His subjects participated in it. The loss of such a large body of labourers would be generally felt as a severe blow to the prosperity of the nation. It would affect all classes. The poor labourers might be benefited; but the employers of labour are the influential classes, and they would be injured. So \"Pharaoh's servants\" were of one mind with their master, and they \"turned against\" the Israelites. Why have we done this? In the retrospect, the afflictions which they had suffered did not seem so very great. They at any rate had survived them, and were not perhaps even seriously impoverished. Royal favour will find a way of making up any losses which court minions have suffered, out of the general taxation of the country. But in prospect, the loss of 600,000 (more or less skilled) labourers appeared a terrible thing. The official class was quite ready to make a strenuous effort to avert the loss.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - He made ready his chariot. The Egyptian monarchs, from the time of the eighteenth dynasty, always went out to war in a chariot. The chariots were, like the Greek and the Assyrian, open behind, and consisted of a semicircular standing-beard of wood, from which rose in a graceful curve the antyx or rim to the height of about two feet and a half above the standing-beard. The chariot had two wheels and a pole, and was drawn by two horses. It ordinarily contained two men only, the warrior and the charioteer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Six hundred chosen chariots. Diodorus Siculus assigns to one Egyptian king a force of 27,000 chariots (1. 54, § 4), which however is probably beyond the truth. But the 1200 assigned to Shishak (2 Chronicles 12:3) may well be regarded as historical; and the great kings of the nineteenth dynasty would possess at least an equal number. The \"six hundred chosen chariots\" set in motion on this occasion probably constituted a division of the royal body-guard (Herod. 2:168). The remaining force would be collected from the neighbouring cities of Northern Egypt, as Memphis, Heliopolis, Bubastis, Pithom, and Pelusium. Captains over every one of them. Rather, \"Captains over the whole of them.\" So the LXX. the Vulgate and Syriac version. Some, however, understand \"warriors in each of them ' (Gesenius, Bodiger, Kalisch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The Children of Israel went out with a high hand - i.e., boldly and confidently, not as fugitives, but as men in the exercise of their just fights - perhaps with a certain amount of ostentation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh Rather, \"all the chariot horses.\" There is no \"and\" in the original. His horsemen. Rather \"his riders,\" or \"mounted men \" - i.e., those who rode in the chariots. That the Egyptians had a powerful cavalry at a later date appears from 2 Chronicles 12:3; but the Hebrew text of Exodus, in remarkable accordance with the native monuments of the time, represents the army of this Pharaoh as composed of two descriptions of troops only - a chariot and an infantry force. (See Hengstenberg, Aegypten und Mose, pp. 127-9). Overtook them. It is uncertain how long the Israelites remained encamped at Pi-hahiroth. They would wait so long as the pillar of the cloud did not move (Numbers 9:18-20). It must have taken Pharaoh a day to hear of their march from Etham, at least another day to collect his troops, and three or four days to effect the march from Tanis to Pi-hahiroth. The Jewish tradition that the Red Sea was crossed on the night of the 21st of Nisan (Abib) is therefore, conceivably, a true one.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 14:10-14NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-14. - THE TERROR OF ISRAEL AND THE COURAGE OF MOSES. It has been argued that the Israelites, if they were so numerous as stated (Exodus 12:37), must have been wretched cowards, if they were afraid to risk an engagement with such an army as that hastily levied one which Pharaoh had brought with him. But the difference between an army of trained soldiers, thoroughly equipped for war, with helmets, shields, breastplates, swords and spears, and an undisciplined multitude, unarmed for the most part, and wholly unaccustomed to warfare, is such, that the latter, whatever its numbers, may be excused if it does not feel able to cope with the former, and declines an engagement. Numbers, without military training and discipline, are of no avail - nay, are even a disadvantage, since the men impede one another. It is not necessary to suppose that the Israelites were debased in character by their long servitude to account for their panic on seeing the army of Pharaoh. They had good grounds for their fear. Humanly speaking, resistance would simply have led to their indiscriminate massacre. The alarm of the Hebrews, and even the reproaches with which they assail Moses, are thus quite natural under the circumstances. What is surprising is, the noble courage and confidence of Moses. Moses, though only vaguely informed, that God would \"be honoured upon Pharaoh and all his host\" (ver. 4), is perfectly certain that all will go well - how the result will be achieved, he knows not; but he is sure that Israel will be delivered and Egypt discomfited; his people have no reason to fear - they have but to \"stand still and see the salvation of God\" (ver. 13); \"the Lord will fight for them;\" they will have simply to \"hold their peace\" (ver. 14). Verse 10. - They were sore afraid. Before the Israelites are taxed with cowardice, let it be considered -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That they were unarmed. Egypt was so settled a government that civilians generally went unarmed; and slaves, like the Hebrews, would scarcely have been allowed to possess any arms, if the case had been otherwise.NEWLINENEWLINE2. They had no military training. Whatever had been done to teach them order and arrangement in connection with their proposed journey, we may be sure there had been no drill or training in the use of arms, since this would have been regarded by the Egyptians as open rebellion.NEWLINENEWLINE3. They were quite unaccustomed to warfare. The Pharaohs main-rained large garrisons of Egyptian and mercenary troops in the frontier provinces, to resist the invasions to which they were liable. The Hebrews may have had occasionally to defend themselves against a hasty raid: but in real war they had stood aloof, and left the fighting to the regular Egyptian army. The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord. The appeal to Jehovah showed that, with all their weaknesses and imperfections, the Israelites were yet true at heart. They knew where alone help was to be obtained, and made their appeal accordingly. No cry is more sure of an answer than the despairing one - \"Lord, save us; we perish.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And they said to Moses. It was not unnatural that, while flying to God as their only refuge, they should be angry with Moses. Moses, they would argue, ought to have known better than to have brought them into a situation of such peril. He, the leader, should have known the geography of the country - he, the courtier, should have known the temper of the court. It is always a satisfaction to men to vent their anger upon some one when they are in a difficulty. No graves in ]Egypt. Egypt, with a necropolis outside every city, was \"a land of tombs;\" surely they might have found graves there, instead of being led out to such a distance simply to die.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Is not this the word that we did tell thee? The reference was probably to that time of depression, after their burdens had been increased, and before the series of miracles began, when the Israelites had addressed reproaches to Moses and Aaron (Exodus 5:21), and refused to listen to words of encouragement (Exodus 6:9). It was not true that they had uniformly held the same language, and desired Moses and Aaron to cease their efforts. It had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die. The spirit to prefer death to slavery, where they are the only alternatives, is not a common one; and we must not be surprised that a people which had grown up in servitude and had no traditions of national independence did not rise to the heroic height attained under other circumstances by Greeks, by Switzers. and by Poles. It would have been most extraordinary had they done so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And Moses said... fear ye not. Moses knew that the pursuit of Israel by the host of the Egyptians was a part of the counsel of God, and was to tend in some way or other to the promotion of God's honour and glory (ver. 4). He had sufficient faith to believe in a deliverance the nature of which it is not likely that he could anyway conjecture. Whether hail would fall from heaven and destroy them (Joshua 10:11); or the earth gape and swallow them up (Numbers 16:32); or the angel of death smite them all in the night (2 Kings 19:35); or any other strange form of destruction come upon them, he did not know; but he concluded from what had been revealed to him, that God was about to vindicate his own honour without the aid of man. Hence his words - Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord - which assigned to the Israelites a mere passive attitude of expectation. For the Egyptians, etc. The order of the words in the original favours the marginal rendering, which is to be adopted with one slight change. Translate - \"For, as ye have seen the Egyptians to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever,\" i.e., ye shall see them no more alive, vigorous and menacing, but still and lifeless upon the Red Sea shore (ver. 30). There is no reference to any other Egyptians than those with Pharaoh in the camp, nor to any later relations between Egypt and the chosen people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Ye shall hold your peace - i.e., \"do nothing, remain at rest.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 14:15-18NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - GOD'S ANSWER TO MOSES' PRAYER. To the faithful prayer of Moses, albeit pitched perhaps in too low a key, God made gracious answer. A \"cry\" had been unnecessary, since his word was already pledged to bring his people safe to Canaan, and to get himself honour upon Pharaoh in connection with the pursuit (ver. 4). But, as the appeal has been made, he responds with a plain statement of what has now to be done: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The Israelites are to make themselves ready for a forward movement (ver. 15);NEWLINENEWLINE2. Moses is to stretch oat his rod over the Red Sea, and it will be divided;NEWLINENEWLINE3. The Israelites are then to make the passage on dry ground;NEWLINENEWLINE4. The Egyptians are to follow, and then honour is to be gotten upon them; and they are to know by the result that God is indeed Jehovah. Verses 15, 16. - Wherefore criest thou to me? It is evident that Moses, while boldly encouraging the people, himself needed the support and consolation of prayer. The Syriac translator shows us that he divined the fact aright, when he without authority intruded the words, \"Moses then cried to Jehovah.\" The form of the Divine reply to his prayer seems to indicate a certain amount of reproach, as if Moses himself had become unduly anxious. Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward. The Israelites were not to rest in their encampment, but to form in line of march, and descend to the very shore of the sea, and there hold themselves in readiness. Moses was to lift up his rod - the rod with which his other miracles had been wrought - and stretch out his hand over the sea, and then the drying up was to begin. Thus was most of the night passed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians. Here, and here only, are the hearts of the Egyptians generally said to have been \"hardened.\" Whatever meaning we attach to the expression, there will be no more difficulty in applying it to them than to Pharaoh. They had made themselves partakers in the monarch's guilt by mustering in hot haste when he summoned them, and had allowed themselves to revel in the anticipation of plunder and carnage (Exodus 15:9). Under such circumstances, the general laws which govern human nature would be quite sufficient to make their hearts grow hard. They shall follow them. Upon this act - rash, if the phenomenon had been a mere natural one - presumptuous and infatuated if the drying up were regarded as miraculous - depended altogether the destruction of the Egyptians. They had only to have \"stood still\" and allowed the escape, which a week previously they had done their best to encourage, in order to have remained safe and unhurt. It was their stupidity and blood-thirstiness which alone brought them into any danger. Upon his horsemen. Rather \"his chariotmen.\" See the comment on verse 9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. All Egypt would learn the destruction of the host, and the circumstances under which it occurred, whose miraculous nature could not be concealed. And the consequence would be a wide recognition of the superior might of Jehovah, the God of Israel, over that of any of the Egyptian deities. More than this the Egyptians were not likely to admit under any circumstances.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 14:19-22NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19-22. - THE PASSAGE OF THE RED SEA. The Egyptians had arrived in the near neighbourhood of the Israelite camp, at the close of a long day's march, towards evening. Having ascertained that the fugitives were still, as they had expected them to be, shut in between the sea and the wilderness, they were content, and made no immediate attack, but encamped over against them. Hereupon, \"the pillar of the cloud,\" which was at the time in front of the Israelite camp - probably near the point where God intended the passage of the sea to be effected \"removed\" from this position, and placed itself directly behind the Israelite encampment, between them and the Egyptians. This movement alone was calculated to alarm the latter, and prevent them from stirring till near daybreak; but, the better to secure their inaction, the pillar was made to overshadow them with a deep and preternatural darkness, so that it became almost impossible for them to advance. Meanwhile, on the side which was turned towards the Israelites, the pillar presented the appearance of a bright flame, lighting up the whole encampment, and rendering it as easy to make ready for the march as it would have been by day. Thus, the beasts were collected and laden the columns marshalled and prepared to proceed in a certain fixed order - and everything made ready for starting so soon as the bed of the sea should be sufficiently dry. Moses, about nightfall, descending to the water's edge, stretched forth his rod over the waves, and, an east wind at once springing up - accompanied perhaps by a strong ebb of the tide - the waters of the gulf were parted in the vicinity of the modern Suez, and a dry space left between the Bitter Lakes, which were then a prolongation of the Gulf, and the present sea-bed. The space may have been one of considerable width. The Israelites entering upon it, perhaps about midnight, accomplished the distance, which may not have exceeded a mile, with all their belongings, in the course of five or six hours, the pillar of the cloud withdrawing itself, as the last Israelites entered the sea-bed, and retiring after them like a rearguard. Thus protected, they made the transit in safety, and morning saw them encamped upon the shores of Asia. Verse 19. - The angel of God. The Divine Presence, which manifested itself in the pillar of the cloud, is called indifferently \"the Lord\" (Exodus 13:21; Exodus 14:24), and \"the Angel of God\" - just as the appearance to Moses in the burning bush is termed both \"God\" and \"the angel of the Lord\" (Exodus 3:2). Which went before - i.e.., \"which ordinarily, and (so to speak) habitually preceded the camp\" (Exodus 13:21; Psalm 78:14). And stood behind them. Took up a fixed station for the night, or the greater portion of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - It was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these. Though there is nothing in the Hebrew correspondent to the expressions \"to them,\" \"to these,\" yet the meaning seems to have been rightly apprehended By our translators.

As commanded by God (ver. 16). Compare the somewhat similar action of Elijah and Elisha, when they divided the Jordan (2 Kings 2:8, 14). The Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind. The LXX. translate \"a strong south wind\" (ἐν ἀνέμῳ νότῳ βιαίῳ); but the Hebrew kadim is certainly \"east\" rather than \"south.\" It is not, however, \"east\" in the sense of due east, but would include all the range of the compass between N.E. and S.E. If we suppose the Bitter Lakes to have been joined to the Red Sea by a narrow and shallow channel, the action of a south-east wind, by driving the water of the Lakes northward, may have easily produced the effect described in the text. A simultaneous ebb of the lower gulf would have further facilitated the passage. The waters were divided. Water remained in the upper extremity of the Gulf, now the site of the Bitter Lakes, and also, of course, below Suez. The portion of the sea dried up lay probably between the present southern extremity of the Bitter Lakes and Suez. By the gradual elevation and desiccation of the region, it has passed into permanent dry land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The waters were a wall - i.e., a protection, a defence. Pharaoh could not attack them on either flank, on account of the two bodies of water between which their march lay. He could only come at them by following after them. The metaphor has been by some understood literally, especially on account of the expression in Exodus 15:8 - \"The floods stood upright as an heap;\" and again that in Psalm 78:13 - \"He made the waters to stand as an heap.\" But those phrases, occurring in poems, must be taken as poetical; and can scarcely have any weight in determining the meaning of \"wall\" here. We must ask ourselves - is there not an economy and a restraint in the exertion by God even of miraculous power? - is more used than is needed for the occasion? - and would not all that was needed at this time have been effected by such a division of the sea as we have supposed, without the fluid being converted into a solid, or having otherwise the laws of its being entirely altered. Kalisch's statement, that the word \"wall\" here is \"not intended to convey the idea of protection, but only of hardness and solidity,\" seems to us the very reverse of the truth. Protection is at any rate the main idea, and any other is secondary and subordinate.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 14:23-31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-31. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EGYPTIANS. As the rearguard of the Israelite host having entered the tract from which the waters had retired, proceeded along it, and left the western end of the isthmus vacant, the pillar of the cloud seems to have followed it up and withdrawn with it. The Egyptians immediately advanced. Notwithstanding the preternatural darkness, they had become aware, perhaps by means of their ears, of the movement that was taking place, and with early dawn they were under arms and pressing on the line of the Israelite retreat. They found the channel still dry, and hastily entering it with their chariot force, they hurried forward in pursuit. The first check which they received was wholly supernatural. \"The Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians\" (ver. 24). Details here are wanting; but less cannot be meant, than that some strange phenomena connected with the retiring \"pillar\" caused a panic and threw the ranks of the army into confusion. Then followed natural impediments. The Lord \"took off,\" or \"clogged\" their chariot Wheels, and made them go heavily - i.e., the chariot wheels, not by miracle, but by the operation of God's natural laws, sank into the soft sand over which the Israelites had passed easily, having no wheeled vehicles, and the chariots were consequently dragged forward slowly and with difficulty. The double hindrance, from the confusion and the stoppage of the chariots, so discouraged the Egyptians, that after a time they resolved on beating a retreat (ver. 25). They had set out on their return, when Moses, at God's instance, stretched forth his hand once mere over the sea, and the waters on both sides began at once to return. The Egyptians saw their danger, and \"fled against\" the advancing tide, racing against it, as it were, and seeking to reach the shore. But in vain. The waves came on rapidly, and (in the language of ver. 28) there was not a man of all those who had entered the dry bed of the sea that was not overwhelmed and drowned in the waters. We should he wrong to press this language to the extreme letter. In graphic narrative the sacred writers uniformly employ universal expressions, where they mean to give the general fact or general result. The true meaning is, that the pursuit altogether failed. Not an Egyptian made his way alive across the strait. All that the Israelites ever saw afterwards of the army that they had so much dreaded (ver. 10) was a ghastly mass of corpses thrown up by the tide on the Asiatic shore (ver. 30).NEWLINENEWLINEExodus 14:23 Verse 23. - All Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. Here, as elsewhere, the word translated \"horsemen\" probably means the men who rode in the chariots. Observe that the Pharaoh himself is not said to have gone in. Menephthah was apt to avoid placing himself in a position of danger (Records of the Past, vol. 4. pp. 44, 45). Nor is any of the infantry said to have entered the bed of the sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - In the morning watch. The \"morning watch\" of the Hebrews at this period of their history lasted from 2 a.m. to sunrise. Sunrise in Egypt, early in April, would take place about a quarter to six. The Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians. The description in Psalm 77:17, 18, is generally regarded as belonging to this point in the narrative of the Exodus, and may be considered as the traditional exposition of it. \"The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound; thine arrows also went abroad; the voice of thy thunder was in the heavens; the lightning lightened the world; the earth trembled and shook.\" As Josephus says \"Showers of rain came down from the sky, and dreadful thunders and lightning, with flashes of fire; thunderbolts also were darted upon them; nor was there anything, wont to be sent by God upon men as indications of his wrath, which did not happen upon this occasion\" (Ant. Jud. 2:16, § 3). And troubled the host. Or \"disturbed the host,\" i.e.,\" threw it into confusion.(συνετάραξε, LXX.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25.- And took off their chariot wheels. The Sept. has \"clogged the axles of their chariots;\" but this is from a reading not at present found in the Hebrew MSS. Most modern commentators, however, prefer the reading, which gives aNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - And the Lord said. God here interposed a new difficulty. Moses was instructed to stretch out his rod once more, and undo his former work. At the appointed sign, the east wind ceased to blow, and the waters of the Bitter Lakes, no longer driven to the north-west by its force, flowed back with something of a reflux, while at the same time, the tide having turned, the Red Sea waves came rushing on at unwonted speed. In vain the Egyptians fled. They were met by the advancing floods, which poured in on either side, overwhelming and covering up all those who had entered on the dangerous path.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The chariots and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh. Rather \"The chariots, and the chariot men of all the host of Pharaoh.\" So Knobel correctly. Kalisch thinks - \"We are not permitted to suppose that only the Egyptian chariots pursued the Israelites into the sea, while the infantry remained behind, so that the former alone were devoured by the waves.\" But even he admits that \"both in this and in the following chapter, and in most other parts generally, the destruction of the chariots (chariot force?) and its warriors is chiefly alluded to, so that this particular stress would perhaps justify that conclusion.\" What is clear is, that no force but the chariot force is said to have entered the bed of the sea in pursuit of Israel. There remained not so much as one of them. On the proper understanding of this statement, see the introductory paragraph to the chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Walked. Rather, \"had walked.\" The waters were a wall. Rather, \"had been a wall.\" For the meaning of the expression, see note on ver. 22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore. Josephus says (Ant. Jud. 2:16, § 6), that, after the passage of the sea by the Israelites, a west wind set in, which (assisted by the current) drove the bodies of the drowned Egyptians to the eastern side of the gulf, where many of them were cast up upon the shore. In this way Moses, according to him, obtained weapons and armour for a considerable number of Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus14:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And Israel saw that great work. The \"work\" was, at the least,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) the (almost) entire destruction of that arm of the service - the chariot force-on which the Egyptian kings mainly relied for success in all their wars; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the defeat and disgrace of the Egyptian king himself, in an expedition for which he was alone responsible, involving permanent discredit to his military capacity, and naturally tending to shake his authority over his subjects. It secured the Israelites from further persecution, mainly by the reminiscences which it left behind, but partly also by removing them to a distance from the natural course of Egyptian warlike or commercial movement. Though Egypt had mining establishments in the Sinaitic peninsula, at Wady-Magharah and Sarabit-el-Khadim, yet as these were avoided by the Israelites on their way to Sinai, and never afterwards approached, there naturally was no collision between them and the Pharaonic garrisons at those sites. Still more remote were they during their wanderings from the Egyptian military route, which proceeded along the coast from Pelusium to Gaza, and then ran northwards through the Shephelah. Thus the Passage of the Red Sea brought one phase in the life of the people to an end, and was the commencement of another. It separated them from Egypt until the time came when their king would hold communication with its monarch on equal terms (1 Kings 3:1). It secured their independence, and raised them at once into a nation. It further caused them to exchange the artificial life of a bureaucratical and convention-loving community for the open space and untrammelled freedom of the desert. It thus rejuvenated and reinvigorated the race, and enabled them to enter on that career of conquest which culminated in the Kingdom - may we not say the Empire? - of David. some writers have supposed that the blow to the Egyptian power was greater than here represented. They believe the entire warrior caste or class to have taken part in the expedition, and to have been destroyed in the Red Sea Thus they describe the calamity as \"the total annihilation of the whole military force of the Egyptians\" (Kalisch). They also believe the Pharaoh to have perished with his host. To the present writer it seems that the former opinion is contrary both to the text of Scripture, and to the after course of Egyptian history, for it is agreed on all hands that Egypt continued nearly as powerful as before, while the latter he regards as at least exceedingly doubtful. Psalm 86:15, is quoted as asserting it; but it appears to himNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that \"overthrow\" is not necessarily \"death;\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that \"Pharaoh and his host ' may be put for \"Pharaoh's host\" by hendiadys. The absence of any prophecy that God would take the Pharaoh's life, and the entire silence of Moses on the subject in chs. 14. and 15. seems to be scarcely explicable on any other theory than that he escaped, not having accompanied his chariot force in its rash pursuit of the Israelites.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-21 - THE SONG OF MOSES. Full of gratitude, joy, and happiness - burning with a desire to vent in devotional utterance of the most fitting kind, his intense and almost ecstatic feelings, Moses, who to his other extraordinary powers, added the sublime gift of poesy, composed, shortly after the passage, a hymn of praise, and sang it with a chorus of the people as a thanksgiving to the Almighty. The hymn itself is generally allowed to be one of transcendent beauty. Deriving probably the general outline of its form and character of its rhythm from the Egyptian poetry of the time, with which Moses had been familiar from his youth, it embodies ideas purely Hebrew, and remarkable for grandeur, simplicity, and depth. Naturally, as being the first outburst of the poetical genius of the nation, and also connected with the very commencement of the national life, it exerted the most important formative influence upon the later Hebrew poetic style, furnishing a pattern to the later lyric poets, from which they but rarely deviated. The \"parallelism of the members,\" which from the middle of the Last century has been acknowledged to be the only real rhythmical law of Hebrew poetry, with its three forms of \"synonymous, antithetic, and synthetic (or verbal) parallelism\" is here found almost us distinctly marked as in any of the later compositions. At the same time, a greater lyrical freedom is observable than was afterwards practised. The song divides itself primarily into two parts: - the first (vers. 1-12) retrospective, celebrating the recent deliverance; the second (vers. 13-18) prospective, describing the effects that would flow from the deliverance in future time. The verbs indeed of the second part are at first grammatical preterites; but (as Kalisch observes) they are \"according to the sense, futures\" - their past form denoting only that the prophet sees the events revealed to him as though they were already accomplished. Hence, after a time, he slides into the future (ver. 16). The second part is continuous, and has no marked break: the first sub-divides into three unequal portions, each commencing with an address to Jehovah, and each terminating with a statement of the great fact, that the Egyptians were swallowed up. These three portions are:NEWLINENEWLINE1. vers. 2-5, \"The Lord is my strength,\" to \"They sank into the bottom as a stone.\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. vers. 6-10,\" Thy right hand, O Lord,\" to \"They sank like lead in the mighty waters.\"NEWLINENEWLINE3. vers. 11-12, \"Who is like unto Thee, O Lord,\" to \"The earth swallowed them.\" The first verse stands separate from the whole, as an introduction, and at the same time as the refrain. Moses and a chorus of men commenced their chant with it, and probably proceeded to the end of ver. 5, when Miriam, with the Hebrew women, interposed with a repetition of the refrain (see ver. 21). The chant of the males was resumed and carried to the close of ver. 10, when again the refrain came in. It was further repeated after ver. 12; and once moral at the close of the whole \"song.\" Similar refrains, or burdens, are found in Egyptian melodies PART I. Verse 1. - Then sang Moses and the children of Israel. It is in accordance with the general modesty of Moses, that he says nothing of the composition of the \"song.\" No serious doubt of his authorship has ever been entertained; but the general belief rests on the improbability of there having been among the Israelites a second literary genius of the highest order, without any mention being made of him. The joint-singing by Moses and \"the children of Israel\" implies the previous training of a choir, and would seem to show that the Israelites remained for some days encamped at the point which they had occupied on quitting the bed of the sea. He hath triumphed gloriously. Literally. He is gloriously glorious.\" (ἐνδόξως δεδόξασται, LXX.) The horse and his rider. Rather, \"The horse and his driver.\" Chariots, not cavalry, are in the mind of the writer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord is my strength and song. Literally, \"My strength and song is Jah.\" The name Jah had not previously been used. It is commonly regarded as an abbreviated form of Jehovah, and was the form generally used in the termination of names, as Abijah, Ahaziah, Hezekiah, Zedekiah, Mount Moriah, etc. It takes the place of \"Jehovah\" here, probably on account of the rhythm. He is become my salvation. Literally, \"He has been to me for salvation,\" i.e., \"He has delivered me out of the hand of Pharaoh and his host, and so saved me from destruction.\" I will prepare him a habitation. This translation seems to have come originally from the Targum of Onkelos, who paraphrases the single word of the text by the phrase \"I will build him a sanctuary.\" The meaning is a possible one: but most modern commentators prefer to connect the verb used with a root meaning \"beautiful,\" and translate \"I will glorify him.\" (So Gesenius. Rosenmuller, Knobel, Kalisch, Cook. The LXX have δοξάσω. The Vulgate has glorificabo. The Syrian and Coptic versions agree, as do also the Targums of Jonathan and of Jerusalem.) The God of my father. See the comment on Exodus 3:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - a man of war. A strong anthropomorphism, but one that could scarcely be misunderstood - \"a man of war,\" meaning commonly \"a warrior,\" or \"one mighty in battle\" (Psalm 24:8). God's might had just been proved, in that he alone had discomfited and destroyed the most potent armed force in the whole world. The Lord is his name. Jehovah - the alone-existing One \"truly describes him,\" before whom all other existence fades and falls into nothingness. On the full meaning of the name, see the comment on Exodus 3:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Pharaoh's chariots and his host. The \"host\" of this passage is not the \"army\" of Exodus 14:9, though in the original the same word is used, but the whole multitude of those who rode in the chariots, and were drowned in the sea. Hath he cast. Or \"hurled.\" The verb commonly expresses the hurling of a javelin or the shooting of an arrow. His chosen captains. Compare Exodus 14:7. Are drowned. Literally, \"were submerged.\" The word describes the act of drowning, not the state of lying drowned in the depths of the sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The depths have covered them. Rather \"covered them.\" Into the bottom. Literally, \"into the abyss.\" Like a stone. The warriors who fought in chariots commonly wore coats of mail, composed of bronze plates sewn on to a linen base, and overlapping one another. The coats covered the arms to the elbow, and descended nearly to the knee. They must have been exceedingly heavy: and the warrior who wore one must have sunk at once, without a struggle, like a stone or a lump of lead (verse 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-18. - Between verses 5 and 6, Miriam's chorus was probably interposed \"Sing ye unto the Lord,\" etc. Then began the second strophe or stanza of the ode. It is, in the main, expansive and exegetical of the preceding stanza, going into greater detail, and drawing a contrast between the antecedent pride and arrogance of the Egyptians and their subsequent miserable fall. Verse 6. - Thy right hand, O Lord. Another anthropomorphism, here used for the first time. Compare ver. 12; Deuteronomy 33:2; and the Psalms, passim. Is become glorious Or \"is glorious. Kalisch rightly regards verses 6 and 7 as containing \"a general description of God's omnipotence and justice,\" and notes that the poet only returns to the subject of the Egyptians in verse 8. So also Knobel. Hath dashed in pieces. Rather, \"Will dash in pieces,\" or \"dashes in pieces\" - a general statement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou hast overthrown, etc. Here again the verbs are future. Translate - \"thou wilt overthrow,\" or \"thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee; thou (wilt send) sendest forth thy wrath, which consumes them as stubble.\" The metaphor in the last clause was one known to the Egyptians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - With the blast of thy nostril the waters were gathered together. Poetically, Moses describes the east wind which God set in motion as \"the blast\" or \"breath of his nostrils.\" By means of it, he says, the waters were \"gathered together,\" or \"piled up;\" then, growing bolder in his imagery, he represents the floods as \"standing in a heap\" on either side, and the depths as \"congealed. No doubt, if these terms are meant to be taken literally, the miracle must have been one in which \"the sea\" (as Kalisch says) \"giving up its nature, formed with its waves a firm wall, and instead of streaming like a fluid, congealed into a hard substance.\" But the question is, are we justified in taking literally the strong expressions of a highly wrought poetical description?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The enemy said. This verse is important as giving the animus of the pursuit, showing what was in the thoughts of the soldiers who flocked to Pharaoh's standard at his call - a point which had not been previously touched. It is remarkable as a departure from the general stately order of Hebrew poesy, and for what has been called its \"abrupt, gasping\" style. The broken speech imitates the utterance of one at once eager and out of breath. I will divide the spoil. The Israelites, it must be remembered, had gone out of Egypt laden with ornaments of silver and of gold, and accompanied by flocks and herds of great value. Pharaoh's soldiers regarded this wealth as legitimate plunder, and intended to appropriate it. My lust. Literally, \"my soul.\" Rage and hate were the passions to be satiated, rather than lust. My hand shall destroy them. So the Vulgate, Onkelos, Rosenmuller, Knobel, Kalisch, and others. The LXX. have κυριεύσει, \"acquire the lordship over them\" (whence our marginal rendering) But the drawn sword points to death rather than recapture.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou didst blow with thy wind. Here we have another fact not mentioned in the direct narrative, but entirely harmonising with it. The immediate cause of the return of the waters, as of their retirement, was a wind. This wind must have come from a new quarter, or its effects would not have been to bring the water back. We may reasonasbly suppose a wind to have arisen contrary to the former one, blowing from the north-west or the north, which would have driven the water of the Bitter LaMes southward, and thus produced the effect spoken cf. The effect may, or may not, have been increased by the flow of the tide in the Red Sea They sank as lead. See the comment on verse 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12 contain the third stanza of the first division of the ode. It is short compared to the other two, containing merely a fresh ascription of praise to God, cast in anew form; and a repetition of the great fact which the poem commemorates - the Egyptian overthrow. We conceive that Miriam's chorus (ver. 21) was again interposed between verses 10 and 11. Verse 11. - Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? It was one great object of the whole series of miraculous visitations whereof Egypt had been the scene, that the true God, Jehovah, should be exalted far above all the gods of the heathen. (See Exodus 7:5; Exodus 14:4, 18.) Moses therefore makes this one of his topics of praise; and at the same time notes three points in which God has no rival -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Holiness;NEWLINENEWLINE2. Awfulness; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. Miraculous power.NEWLINENEWLINECompare Psalm 86:8; \"Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like thy works.\" Fearful in praises - i.e., \"to be viewed with awe even when we praise Him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou stretchedst out thy right hand. Thou hadst only to stretch out an arm, and at once thy enemies perished. The earth swallowed them up - i.e., the sea, which is a part of the earth. PART II.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou in thy mercy hast led forth. Or \"leadest forth.\" See the Introduction to the chapter. Which thou hast redeemed. See the comment on Exodus 6:6. Then hast guided. Or \"thou guidest.\" Thy holy habitation. By \"God's holy habitation\" some understand Mount Sinai, others Canaan, others Mount Moriah, or even the temple there to be built ultimately. That Sinai is not intended seems clear from verses 14, 15, where the nations mentioned are such as were untouched by the occupation of that mountain. Canaan might sufficiently answer the requirements of the present verse, but scarcely comes up to those of verse 17. Altogether, it is clear that Moses knew there would be a place in the land of Canaan where God would \"put his name\" (Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14; Deuteronomy 14:23, 24; Deuteronomy 16:6, 11; Deuteronomy 26:2; etc.); and it would seem to be not unlikely that he may have known where the place would be by special revelation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The people shall hear. - Rather, \"the peoples\" - i.e., the tribes, or nations, of these parts - Philistines, Amalekites, Edomites, Moabites, etc. - will hear of the wonders done in Egypt, especially of the crowning wonder of all - Israel's passage through the Red Sea and Egypt's destruction in it - and will in consequence tremble with fear when the Israelites approach them, and offer them no effectual opposition. Palestine. This is a Greek form. The Hebrew is Phelasheth, which would perhaps be best translated \"Philistia.\" (Compare Psalm 60:8; Psalm 87:4; Psalm 108:9.) The Philistine country was a strip of territory extending along the coast of the Mediterranean from a little below Gaze on the south, nearly to Mount Carmel on the north. It is curious that the philistines are not mentioned under that name on any of the early Egyptian monuments. They may perhaps be the Purusaia of the time of Rameses III., whom some however identify with the Pelasgi.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The Dukes of Edom. Compare Genesis 36:15. By the time that the Israelitesapproached the borders of Edom, the dukes had given place to kings (Numbers 20:14), and everything like abject fear of Israel had passed sway. The Edomites \"came out against Moses with much people and with a strong hand,\" and refused to allow the Israelites passage through their borders (ib, vers. 20, 21). The mighty men of Moab. The alarm of the Moabites was indicated by Balak's efforts to induce Balaam to curse the Israelites (Numbers 22-24.). By their \"mighty men\" some understood men of unusual strength and stature (Cook); but the expression, which is very frequent both in the prophetical and the historical books, seems to be a mere periphrasis for \"warriors.\" All the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. This prophecy received a remarkable accomplishment when \"it came to pass that all the kings of the Cannanites heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, and their heart melted, neither was their spirit in them any more\" (Joshua 5:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Fear and dread shall fall upon them. Compare Deuteronomy 2:25; Deuteronomy 11:25. The Edomites of Mount Seir and the Moabites gave Israel a free passage through their borders (Deuteronomy 2:4-8, 18, 29), being afraid to oppose them. Till thy people pass over, O Lord. Some see in this an anticipation of the crossing of Jordan; but perhaps Moses meant no more than the crossing of the Canaanite frontier, in some place or other, which must take place if the urea was to be occupied. The event made the expression used peculiarly appropriate. When thou hast purchased. By bringing his people out of Egypt, their ownership had passed to him from the Egyptians, just as if he had bought them.

The Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them. See Exodus 14:26, 27; and Exodus 15:10. The waters did not merely return to their natural place when the east wind ceased to blow, but were \"brought back\" by miraculous power, and with abnormal rapidity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Miriam, the prophetess. Miriam is regarded by the prophet Micah 6:4, as having had a share in the deliverance of Israel, and claims the prophetic gift in Numbers 12:2. Her claim appears to be allowed both in the present passage, and in Numbers 12:6-8. where the degree of her inspiration is placed below that of Moses. She is the first woman whom the Bible honours with the title of \"prophetess.\" Prophetesses were common in Egypt at a much earlier date; and thus, that a woman should have the gift would have seemed no strange thing to the Hebrews. For examples of other prophetesses, see Judges 4:4; 2 Kings 22:14; Isaiah 8:3; Luke 2:36. The sister of Aaron. Compare Numbers 26:59. Miriam is generally regarded as the sister of Moses mentioned in Exodus 2:4-8, whose name is not there given. If so, she was considerably older than either Moses or Aaron. Took a timbrel By \"a timbrel\" our translators meant what is now called \"a tambourine.\" Such instruments were common in Egypt (Wilkinson, Ancient Egyptians, vol. 1. p. 93), and in the representations are generally played by women. The separation of the men and women into distinct bands was an Egyptian custom; as likewise was the execution of dances by performers who accompanied their steps with music (ibid. vol. it. pp. 235, 301).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Miriam answered them. Miriam, with her chorus of women, answered the chorus of men, responding at the termination of each stanza or separate part of the ode with the refrain, \"Sing ye to the Lord,\" etc. (See the \"Introduction\" to this chapter.) While responding, the female chorus both danced and struck their tambourines. This use of dancing in a religious ceremonial, so contrary to Western ideas of decorum, is quite consonant with Oriental practice, both ancient and modern. Other examples of it in Scripture are David's dancing before the ark (2 Samuel 6:16), the dancing of Jephthah's daughter (Judges 11:34), and that of the virgins of Shiloh (Judges 21:21). It is also mentioned with approval in the Psalms (Psalm 149:3; el. 4). Dancing was practised as a religious ceremony in Egypt, in Phrygia, in Thrace, by the Phoenicians, by the Syrians, by the Romans, and others. In the nature of things there is clearly nothing unfitting or indecorous in a dedication to religion of what has been called \"the poetry of gesture.\" But human infirmity has connected such terrible abuses with the practice that the purer religions have either discarded it or else denied it admission into their ceremonial. It still however lingers in Mohammedanism among those who are called \"dancing dervishes,\" whose extraordinary performances are regarded as acts of devotion.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 15:22-27NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-27. - THE JOURNEY FROM THE RED SEA TO ELIM. After a stay, which cannot be exactly measured, but which was probably one of some days, near the point of the Eastern coast of the Gulf of Suez, at which they had emerged from the sea-bed, the Israelites, under the guidance of the pillar of the cloud, resumed their journey, and were conducted southwards, or south-eastwards, through the arid tract, called indifferently \"the wilderness of Shut\" (verse 22), and \"the wilderness of Etham\" (Numbers 33:8), to a place called Marah. It is generally supposed that the first halt must have been at Ayun Musa, or \"the springs of Moses.\" This is \"the only green spot near the passage over the Red Sea\" (Cook). It possesses at present seventeen wells, and is an oasis of grass and tamarisk in the midst of a sandy desert. When Wellsted visited it in 1836, there were abundant palm-trees. It does not lie on the shore, but at the distance of about a mile and a half from the beach, with which it was at one time connected by an aqueduct, built for the convenience of the ships, which here took in their water. The water is regarded as good and wholesome, though dark-coloured and somewhat brackish. From Ayun Musa the Israelites pursued their way in a direction a little east of south through a barren plain where sand-storms are frequent - part of the wilderness of Shur - for three days without finding water. Here their flocks and herds must have suffered greatly, and many of the animals probably died on the journey. On the last of the three days water was found at a spot called thenceforth \"Marah,\" \"bitterness,\" because the liquid was undrinkable. After the miracle related in ver. 25, and an encampment by the side of the sweetened spring (Numbers 33:8), they proceeded onward without much change of direction to Elim, where was abundance of good water and a grove of seventy palm-trees. Here \"they encamped by the waters,\" and were allowed a rest, which probably exceeded a fortnight (See the comment on Exodus 16:1.) Verse 22. - So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea. There is no such connection between this verse and the preceding narrative as the word \"so\" expresses. Translate \"And Moses brought.\" The wilderness of Shur, called also that of Etham (Numbers 33.8) appears to have extended from Lake Serbonis on the north, across the isthmus, to the Red Sea, and along its eastern shores as far as the Wady Ghurundel. It is almost wholly waterless; and towards the south, such wells as exist yield a water that is bitter in the extreme. Three days. The distance from Ayun Musa to Ain Howarah, the supposed representative of Marah, is not more than about 36 miles; but the day's march of so large a multitude through the desert may not have averaged more than twelve miles. And found no water. No doubt the Israelites carried with them upon the backs of their asses water in skins, sufficient for their earn wants during such an interval; but they can scarcely have carried enough for their cattle. These must have suffered greatly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And when they came to Marah. It is not clear whether the place already bore the name on the arrival of the Israelites, or only received it from them. Marah would mean \"bitter\" in Arabic no less than in Hebrew. The identification of Marah with the present Ain Howarah, in which most modern writers acquiesce, is uncertain from the fact that there are several bitter springs in the vicinity - one of them even bitterer than Howarah. (See Winer, Realworterbuch, ad voc. MARAH) We may, however, feel confident that the bitter waters of which the Israelites \"would not drink\" were in this neighbourhood, a little north of the Wady Ghurundel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And the people murmured against Moses. As they had already done on the western shores of the Red Sea (Exodus 14:11, 12), and as they were about to do so often before their wanderings were over. (See below, Exodus 16:2; Exodus 17:3; Numbers 14:2; Numbers 16:41; Deuteronomy 1:27, etc.) \"Murmuring\" was the common mode in which they vented their spleen, when anything went ill with them; and as Moses had persuaded them to quit Egypt, the murmuring was chiefly against him. The men who serve a nation best are during their lifetime least appreciated. What shall we drink? Few disappointments are harder to bear than that of the man, who after long hours of thirst thinks that he has obtained wherewith to quench his intolerable longing, and on raising the cup to his lips, finds the draught so nauseous that he cannot swallow it. Very unpalatable water is swallowed when the thirst is great (Eothen, p. 197). But there is a limit beyond which nature will not go. There \"may be water, water everywhere, yet not a drop to drink.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - The Lord shewed him a tree. - Several trees or plants belonging to different parts of the world, are said to possess the quality of rendering bitter water sweet and agreeable; as the nellimaram of Coromandel, the sassafras of Florida, the yerva Caniani of Peru, and the perru nelli (Phylanthus emblica) of India. But none of them is found in the Sinaitic. peninsula. Burckhardt suggested (Travels in Syria. p. 474) that the berries of the ghurkud (Peganum retusum), a low thorny shrub which grows abundantly round the Ain Howarah, may have been used by Moses to sweeten the drink; but there are three objections to this.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Moses is not said to have used the berries, but the entire plant;NEWLINENEWLINE2. The berries would not have been procurable in April, since they do not ripen till June; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. They would not have produced any such effect on the water as Burckhardt imagined. In fact there is no tree or shrub now growing in the Sinaitic peninsula, which would have any sensible effect on such water as that of Ain Howarah; and the Bedouins of the neighbourhood know of no means by which it can be made drinkable. Many of the Fathers believed that the \"tree\" had no natural effect, and was commanded to be thrown in merely to symbolise the purifying power of the Cross of Christ. But to moderns such a view appears to savour of mysticism. It is perhaps most probable that there was some tree or shrub in the vicinity of the bitter fountain in Moses' time which had a natural purifying and sweetening power, but that it has now become extinct. If this be the case, the miracle consisted in God's pointing out the tree to Moses, who had no previous knowledge of it. The waters were made sweet. Compare the miracle of Elisha (2 Kings 2:19-22). There he made for them a statute and an ordinance. See the next verse. God, it appears, after healing the water, and satisfying the physical thirst of his people, gave them an ordinance, which he connected by a promise with the miracle. If they would henceforth render strict obedience to all his commandments, then he would \"heal\" them as he had healed the water, would keep them free at once from physical and from moral evil, from the diseases of Egypt, and the diseases of their own hearts. And there he proved them. From the moment of their quitting Egypt to that of their entering Canaan, God was ever \"proving\" his people - trying them, that is - exercising their faith, and patience and obedience and power of self-denial, in order to fit them for the position which they were to occupy in Canaan. He had proved them at the Red Sea, when he let them be shut in between the water and the host of the Egyptians - he proved them now at Marah by a bitter disappointment - he proved them again at Meribah (Exodus 17:1-7); at Sinai (Exodus 20:20); at Taberah (Numbers 11:1-3); at Kibroth-hattaavah (ib, verse 34); at Kadesh (ib, 13:26-33), and elsewhere. For forty years he led them through the wilderness\" to prove them, to know what was in their heart\" (Deuteronomy 8.), to fit them for their glorious and conquering career in the land of promise All these diseases. See Deuteronomy 7:15; Deuteronomy 28:27. Kalisch correctly observes that, though the Egyptians had the character in antiquity of being among the healthiest and most robust of nations (Herod. 2:77), yet a certain small number of diseases have always raged among them with extreme severity He understands the present passage of the plagues, which, however, are certainly nowhere else called \"diseases.\" There is no reason why the word should not be taken literally, as all take it in the passages of Deuteronomy above cited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - They came to Elim. Elim was undoubtedly some spot in the comparatively fertile tract which lies south of the \"wilderness of Shur,\" intervening between it and the \"wilderness of Sin\" - now E1 Murkha. This tract contains the three fertile wadys of Ghurundel, Useit, and Tayibeh, each of which is regarded by some writers as the true Elim. It has many springs of water, abundant tamarisks, and a certain number of palm-trees. On the whole, Ghurundel seems to be accepted by the majority of well-informed writers as having the best claim to be considered the Elhn of this passage Twelve wells. Rather \"springs.\" The \"twelve springs\" have not been identified; but the Arabs are apt to conceal the sources of their water supplies (Niebuhr, Arabie, p. 347). A large stream flows down the Wady Ghurundel in the winter-time (ibid.), which later becomes a small brook (Burckhardt, Syria, p. 778), and dries up altogether in the autumn. The pasture is good at most seasons, sometimes rich and luxuriant; there are abundant tamarisks, a considerable number of acacias, and. some palms. Three score and ten palm trees. The palm-trees of this part of Arabia are \"not like those of Egypt or of pictures, but either dwarf - that is, truntdess - or else with savage hairy trunks, and branches all dishevelled\" (Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 68). There are a considerable number in the Wady Ghurundel, and others in the Wady Tayibeh (ib, p. 69). They encamped there. It has been observed that the vast numbers of the host would more than fill the Wady Ghurundel, and that while the main body encamped there, others, with their cattle, probably occupied the adjacent wadys - Useit, Ethal, and even Tayibeh or Shuweikah - which all offer good pasturageNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - THE FIRST MURMURING FOR FOOD. From Elim, or the fertile tract extending from Wady Ghurnndel to Wady Tayibeh, the Israelites, after a time, removed, and ca-camped (as we learn from Numbers 33:10) by the Red Sea, probably along the narrow coast tract extending from the mouth of Tayibeh to the entrance upon the broad plain of El Markha. Hence they entered upon \"the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai\" - a tract identified by some with the coast plain, El Markha, by others with the inland undulating region known at the present day as the Debbet-er-Ramleh It is difficult to decide between these two views. In favour of El Markha are:NEWLINENEWLINE1. The fact that the Egyptian settlements in the Sinaitic peninsula would thus be avoided, as they seem to have been, since no contest with Egyptians is recorded;NEWLINENEWLINE2. The descent of the quails, who, wearied with a long flight over the Red Sea, would naturally settle as soon as they reached the shore;NEWLINENEWLINE3. The greater openness and facility of the El Markha and Wady Feiran route, which is admitted by all; andNEWLINENEWLINE4. The suitability of the latter to the particulars of the narrative in ch. 18. In favour of the route by the Debbet-er-Ramleh are,NEWLINENEWLINE1. The fact that it is better watered at present than the other;NEWLINENEWLINE2. Its being somewhat less removed from the direct line between Wady Ghurundel and Sinai than El Markha; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. A certain correspondency of sound or meaning between some of the present geographical names along this route and those of the Mosaic narrative. In \"the wilderness of Sin\" the Israelites for the first time found themselves in want of sufficient nourishment. They hall consumed the grain which they had brought with them out of Egypt; and though no doubt they had still considerable flocks and herds, yet they were unaccustomed to a mere milk and flesh diet, having in Egypt lived principally upon bread (ver. 3), fish (Numbers 11:5), and vegetables (ibid.). They therefore \"murmured,\" and accused Moses and Aaron of an intention to starve them. It is quite possible that many of the poorer sorts having brought with them no cattle, or lost their cattle by the way, and not being helped by their brethren, were in actual danger of starvation. Hence God was not angry, but \"heard their murmurings\" (ver. 9) patiently, and relieved them. Verse 1. - They journeyed from Elim, and all the congregation came. It has been noted (Cook) that the form of expression seems to imply that the Israelites proceeded in detachments from Elim, and were first assembled as a complete host when they reached the wilderness of Sin.\" This accords well with their numbers and with the character of the localities. They could only assemble all together when they reached some considerable plain. Between Elim and Sinai. This expression must be regarded as vague to some extent. On the direct line, as the crow flies, there is no \"wilderness\" (midbar) between Wady Ghurundel and Sinai. All is mountain and valley. All that the writer means is that \"the wilderness of Sin\" lay upon the ordinary, or at any rate an ordinary route between Elim and the great mountain. This is equally true of El Markha and the Debbet-er-Ramleh. On the fifteenth day of the second month - i.e., on the 15th of Zif, exactly one month after their departure from Egypt. As only seven camping places are mentioned (Numbers 33:5-11), and one journey of three days through a wilderness (Exodus 15:22), it is evident that there must either have been long stays in several places, or that they must have often encamped in places which had no name. Viewed as an itinerary, the record is manifestly incomplete.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The whole congregation... murmured, It has been observed above, that only the poorer sort could have been as yet in any peril of actual starvation; but it may well have been that the rest, once launched into the wilderness, and becoming practically acquainted with its unproductiveness, foresaw that ultimately starvation must come upon them too, when all the cattle were eaten up, or had died through insufficient nourishment Nothing is more clear than that, without the miracle of the manna, it would have been impossible for a population of two millions to have supported themselves for forty years, or even for two years, in such a region as the Sinaitic peninsula, even though it had been in ancient times three or four times as productive as at present. The cattle brought out of Egypt must have rapidly diminished (Exodus 17:3); and though the Israelites had brought with them also great wealth in the precious metals, yet it must have been some time before they could establish commercial relations with the neighbouring nations so as to obtain such supplies as they needed. Thus we can well understand that at the expiration of a month the people generally should have recognized that their situation was one of great danger, and should have vented their discontent upon their leaders.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt - i.e., \"Would that God had smitten us with a painless death, as he did the first-born of the Egyptians! Then we should have avoided the painful and lingering death from starvation which we now see before us.\" The cry puts on the garb of piety, and names the name of Jehovah, but indicates a want of faith in him, his power, and his promises (Exodus 4:8, 17; Exodus 6:8; Exodus 12:25; Exodus 13:5, 11), which was sinful, and, after the miracles that they had seen, barely excusable. When we sat by the flesh-pots of Egypt. Compare Numbers 11:5. Both passages make it clear that, whatever the sufferings of the Israelites in Egypt from the cruelty of the taskmasters and the hard tasks set them, at any rate their sustenance was well cared for - they had abundance of agreeable food. Did eat bread. It has been said that \"bread\" here means \"food in general\" (Kalisch); and no doubt the word has sometimes that sense. But it was probably actual bread, rather than anything else, for which the Israelites were longing. See the Introduction to the chapter.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 16:4-8NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-8. - THE PROMISE OF BREAD FROM HEAVEN. When men who are in real distress make complaint, even though the tone of their complaint be not such as it ought to be, God in his mercy is wont to have compassion upon them, to \"hear their mummurings,\" etc., and grant them some relief. But the relief is seldom of the kind which they expect, or pray for. The Israelites wished for actual bread, made of wheaten or barley flour. God gave them, not such bread, but a substitute for it. And first, before giving it, be promised that it should be given. Thus expectation was aroused; faith was exercised; the supernatural character of the relief was indicated; the power and the goodness of God, were, both of them, shown forth. And with the promise was given a law. They were on each occasion to gather no more than would suffice for the day. Thus they would continually \"live by faith,\" taking no thought for the morrow, but trusting all to God. Verse 4. - Bread from heaven. Compare Psalm 78:24; Nehemiah 9:15; John 6:31-51. The expression is of course not to be trader-stood literally. The substance was not actual bread, neither was it locally transferred from the distant region called \"heaven\" to the soil of the Sinaitic peninsula. But it was called \"bread,\" because it was intended to serve instead of bread, as the main support of life during the sojourn of Israel in the wilderness; and it was said to be \"from heaven,\" first, as descending on 'the ground out of the circumambient air; and secondly, as miraculously sent by him, whose seat is in heaven. The people shall gather a certain rate every day. Rather \"a day's supply every day,\" such a quantity as shall seem to each man reasonably sufficient for himself and his family. That I may prove them. As in Paradise God coupled with his free gift of \"every tree of the garden\" the positive precept, \"But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat,\" - that he might prove our first parents, whether they would obey him or not - so now he \"proved\" the obedience of the Israelites by a definite, positive command - they were not to gather on ordinary days more than was sufficient for the day. All life is intended as a probation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - On the sixth day. That a period of seven days was known to the Hebrews as a week appears from the story of Jacob and Laban (Genesis 29:27). But there is no distinct evidence that the year was as yet divided into weeks, much less that the several days of the week were as yet distinguished as the first, second, third day, etc. \"The sixth day,\" here probably means (as Kalisch says), \"the sixth day after' the first supply of the manna. They shall prepare. The preparation would be, first, by measurement (ver. 18), and then by pounding and grinding (Numbers 11:8). It shall be double. Some commentators suppose that in these words is implied an order that on the sixth day they should set themselves to gather a double quantity. But the natural meaning of the words is, that, having gathered the usual quantity, they should find, when they measured it, that, by miracle, the supply sufficient for one day was multiplied, so as to suffice for two. (So Kalisch, Knobel, Kurtz, and others.) This view is in harmony with verse 18, which tells of a miraculous expansion and diminution of the manna after it had been gathered, and with verse 22, which shows us \"the rulers\" surmised by the miracle of the sixth day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - At even, then ye shall know. See verses 12 and 13. The first evidence which the Israelites would have, that God had heard 'and considered their complaints, would be the descent of the quails at even of the day on which Moses and Aaron addressed them. That the Lord hath brought you out - i.e., \"that it is not we who, to gratify our own personal ambition, have induced you to quit Egypt under our guidance; but that all which we have done has been to act as God's instruments, and to carry out his designs.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. ? And in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the Lord. This has been supposed to refer to the manifestation of God's presence recorded in verse 10; but the balance of the two clauses in verses 6 and 7 implies two similar manifestations, and their arrangement shows the priority of the evening one. Now the manifestation of verse 10 preceded the coming of the quails. The manifestation which followed it, which was similar, and in the morning, was the fall of the manna. For that he heareth your murmurings. The connection of this clause with the preceding furnishes an additional argument in favour of the exposition that \"the glory of God,\" spoken of in this verse is the manna. Against the Lord. Professedly and directly against us, but indirectly and really against God, whose instruments we have been in the whole matter of the exodus. What are we? - i.e., \"What power have we of our own? We have no hereditary rank, no fixed definite position. We are simply the leaders whom you have chosen to follow, because you believed us to have a commission from God. Apart from this, we are nobodies. But, if our commission is conceded, we are to you in the place of God; and to murmur against us is to murmur against Jehovah.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - When the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat. Moses must have received a distinct intimation of the coming arrival of the quails, trough he has not recorded it, his desire of brevity causing him to retrench all that is not absolutely necessary for the right understanding of the narrative. It is, comparatively, seldom that he records both the Divine message and his delivery of it. In general, he places upon record either the message only, or its delivery only. Bread to the full. Compare above, verse 4; and infra, verses 12 and 18. The Lord heareth your murmurings. The latter part of this verse is, in the main, a repetition of verse 7; but it emphasises the statements of that verse, and prepares the way for what follows.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 16:9-21NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-21. - THE PROMISE FULFILLED. Moses had made a double promise to the Israelites in God's name. \"The Lord shall give you,\" he had said,\" in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full\" (ver. 8). And now the time for the fulfilment of the double promise approached. First, however, before they received the blessings, he required them to present themselves before the Lord. As they had rebelled in murmuring, an act of homage was proper; and as they had called in question the conduct of Moses and Aaron. some token that God approved the action of these his faithful servants, and would support them, was needed. Hence the appearance of the Lord to the congregation in the cloud (ver. 10). After this, when evening approached, the quails fell. A vast flight of this migratory bird, which often arrives in Arabia Petraea from the sea (Diod. Sic. 1:60), fell to the earth about the Hebrew camp, and, being quite exhausted, lay on the ground in a state which allowed of their being taken by the hand. The Israelites had thus abundant \"flesh to eat\" (ver. 8), for God \"sent them meat enough\" (Psalm 78:26). The next morning, the remainder of the promise was fulfilled. When they awoke, they found that the vegetation about the camp was covered with a sort of dew, resembling hoar-frost, which was capable of easy detachment from the leaves, and which proved to be an edible substance. While they were in doubt about the phenomenon, Moses informed them that this was the \"bread from heaven\" which they had been promised (ver. 15). At the same time he instructed them as to the quantity which they should gather, which he fixed at an omer for each member of their family (ver. 16). In attempting to carry out these instructions, mistakes were not unnaturally made; some exceeded the set quantity, others fell short of it. But the result was found to be the same. Whatever the quantity gathered, when it was brought home and measured, the amount was by miracle made to be exactly an omer for each (ver. 18). Afterwards, Moses gave another order. The whole of the manna was to be consumed (ordinarily) on the day on which it was gathered. When some wilfully disobeyed this command, the reserved manna was found on the next day to have become bad - it had bred worms, and gave out an offensive odour. This circumstance put a stop to the malpractice.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - At even. Literally, \"between the two evenings.\" For the meaning of the phrase, see the comment on Exodus 12:6. Ye shall eat flesh. The quails, as appears by the subsequent narrative, were supplied, not regularly, but only on rare occasions; in fact (so far as appears), only here in the wilderness of Sin, and at Kibroth-hattaavah in the wilderness of Paran (Numbers 11:31-34). They were not a necessary, but an indulgence. Ye shall know that I am the Lord. The miracle of the manna, and the timely appearance of the quails at the hour announced, will sufficiently show that it is God himself who has you under his charge and watches over you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The quails came up. The word here translated, \"quails\" has been supposed to designate the flying-fish (Trigla Israelitarum of Ehrenberg), or a species of locust (Ludolf). But Psalm 78:28, makes it clear that \"feathered fowls\" are intended; and moderns generally, are agreed that the rendering \"quails\" is right. It has the authority of the Septuagint, of Josephus, and of the Vulgate. Diodorus says that \"the inhabitants of Arabia Petraea prepared long nets, spread them near the coast for many stadia, and thus caught a great number of quails which are in the habit of coming in from the sea\" (2:60). The quail regularly migrates from Syria and Arabia in the autumn, and winters in the interior of Africa, whence it returns northwards in immense masses in the spring (Schubert, Reise, vol. 2. p. 361). Kalisch thinks that the particular species of quail intended is the kata of the Arabs (Tetrao Alchata of Linnaeus); but the common quail (Tetrao coturnix) is preferred by most commentators. When these birds approach the coast after a long flight over the Red Sea, they are often so exhausted that they rather fall to the ground than settle, and are then easily taken by the hand or killed with sticks. Their flesh is regarded by the natives as a delicacy. Covered the camp - i.e., covered all the ground between the tents in which the Israelites lived in the wilderness. The dew lay. Literally, \"there was a layer of dew\" - something, i.e., lay on the ground outside the camp which looked like dew, and was in part dew, but not wholly so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - When the dew that lay was gone up. The moisture which lay upon the herbage soon evaporated, drawn up by the sun; and then the miracle revealed itself. There remained upon each leaf and each blade of grass a delicate small substance, compared here to hoar frost, and elsewhere (Numbers 11:7) to \"coriander seed,\" which was easily detached and collected in bags or baskets. The thing was altogether a novelty to the Israelites, though analogous in some degree to natural processes still occurring in the country. These processes are of two kinds. At certain times of the year there is a deposit of a glutinous substance from the air upon leaves and even upon stones, which may be scraped off, and which resembles thick honey. There is also an exudation from various trees and shrubs, especially the tamarisk, which is moderately hard, and is found both on the growing plant and on the fallen leaves beneath it, in the shape of small, round, white or greyish grains. It is this last which is the manna of commerce. The Biblical manna cannot be identified with either of these two substances. In some points it resembled the one, in other points the other; in some, it differed from both. It came out of the air like the \"air-honey,\" and did not exude from shrubs; but it was hard, like the manna of commerce, and could be \"ground in mills\" and \"beaten in mortars,\" which the \"air-honey\" cannot. It was not a medicament, like the one, nor a condiment, like the other, but a substance suited to be a substitute for bread, and to become the main sustenance of the Israelitish people. It was produced in quantities far exceeding anything that is recorded of either manna proper, or air honey. It accompanied the Israelites wherever they went during the space of forty years, whereas the natural substances, which in certain points resemble it, are confined to certain districts, and to certain seasons of the year. During the whole space of forty years it fell regularly during six consecutive days, and then ceased on the seventh. It \"bred worms\" if kept till the morrow on all days of the week except one; on that one - the Sabbath - it bred no worms, but was sweet and good. Thus, it must be regarded as a peculiar substance, miraculously created for a special purpose, but similar in certain respects to certain known substances which are still produced in the Sinaitic region.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - They said one to another, this is manna. Rather, \"this is a gift.\" To suppose that they recognised the substance as one known to them in Egypt under the name of menu or mennu, is to make this clause contradict the next. To translate \"what is this?\" gives good sense, but is against grammar, since the Hebrew for \"what\" is not man but mah. The Septuagint translators (who render τί ἐστι τοῦτο) were probably deceived by their familiarity with the Chaldee, in which man corresponds to \"what.\" Not knowing what to call the substance, the Israelites said one to another, \"it is a gift\" - meaning a gift from heaven, God's gift (compare verse 8); and afterwards, in consequence of this, the word man (properly \"gift\") became the accepted name of the thing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - An omer for every man. According to Kalisch, the omer is about two quarts (English): but this estimate is probably in excess. Josephus makes the measure one equal to six cotyles, which would be about a quart and a half, or three pints. In his tents. Rather, \"in his tent.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The children of Israel did so The Israelites set themselves to obey Moses, and gathered what they supposed to be about an omer; but, as a matter of course, some of them exceeded the amount, while others fell short of it. There was no wilful disobedience thus far.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - When they did mete it with an omer. On returning to their tents, with the manna which they had collected, the Israelites proceeded to measure it with their own, or a neighbour's, omer measure, when the wonderful result appeared, that, whatever the quantity actually gathered by any one, the result of the measurement showed, exactly as many omers as there were persons in the family. Thus, he that had gathered much found that he had nothing over, and he that had gathered little found that he had no lack.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Let no man leave of it till the morning. Moses, divinely instructed, warned the people that they were not to lay up in store any of their manna to be eaten the next day. God would have them trust their future wants to him, and \"take no thought for the morrow.\" Some of them, however, were disobedient, with the result stated in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - It bred worms. This was a supernatural, not a natural result. It served as a sort of punishment of the disobedient, and effectually checked the practice of laying up in store.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - When the sun waxed hot it melted. The manna had to be gathered early. What had not been collected before the sun grew hot, melted away and disappeared from sight. In this respect the miraculous manna resembled both the manna of commerce and the \"air-honey.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 16:22-30NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-30. - THE GATHERING OF THE SIXTH DAY. When the Israelites, having collected what seemed to them the usual quantity of manna on the sixth day, brought it home and measured it, they found the yield to be, not an omer a head for each member of the family, but two omers. The result was a surprise and a difficulty. They could not consume more than an omer a-piece. What was to be done with the remainder? Was it to be destroyed, or kept? If kept, would it not \"breed worms\"? To resolve their doubts, the elders brought the matter before Moses, who replied - \"This is that which the Lord hath said.\" It is to be supposed that, in his original announcement to the elders of God's purposes as to the manna, Moses had informed them that the quantity would be double on the sixth day (ver. 5); but his statement had not made any deep impression at the time, and now they had forgotten it. So he recalls it to their recollection. \"This is no strange thing - nothing that should have surprised you - it is only what God said would happen. And the reason of it is, that to-morrow, the seventh day is, by God's ordinance, the rest of the Holy Sabbath,\" - or rather \"a rest of a holy Sabbath to the Lord.\" Whether or no the Sabbath was a primeval institution, given to our first parents in Paradise (Genesis 2:3), may be doubted: at any rate, it had not been maintained as an institution by the Hebrews during their sojourn in Egypt; and this was, practically, to them, the first promulgation of it. (See Hessey's Bampton Lectures, p. 149.) Hence, in the original, it is not called \"the sabbath,\" as if already known, but \"a sabbath,\" - i.e., a rest - until verse 29. Verse 22. - This is that which the Lord hath said. Rather, \"said,\" i.e., declared to me when he announced the manna. See verse 5. It has been supposed that Moses had not communicated the declaration to the elders; but this seems unlikely. The rest of the holy sabbath. If this translation were correct, the previous institution of the sabbath, and the knowledge of its obligation by the Hebrews, would follow; but the absence of the article is a strong indication that the whole idea was new, at any rate to those whom Moses was addressing. Bake that which ye will bake, etc. \"Do,\" i.e., \"as you have done on other days - bake some and seethe some - but also reserve a portion to be your food and sustenance to-morrow.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They laid it up. The great bulk of the Israelites obeyed Moses, and laid by a portion (half?) of the manna gathered on the sixth day. On the morning of the seventh, this was found to be perfectly good, and not to have \"bred worms\" in the night. Either this was a miracle, or the corruption previously noticed (ver. 20) was miraculous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - And Moses said. The Sabbath being come, Moses explained fully the reason for the order which he had given, and generalized it. God required the Sabbath to be \"a day of holy rest\" - no manna would fall on it, and therefore none could be gathered - the produce of the sixth day's gathering would be found to suffice both for the sixth day and the seventh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - There went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather. There will always be some persons in a nation, or in a Church, who will refuse to believe God's ministers, and even God himself. They persuade themselves that they \"know better\" - it will not be as announced - it will be as they wish it to be. More especially is this so where the idea of continuance comes in - where some interruption of the ordinary course of things is announced, which they deem unlikely or impossible. Compare Genesis 19:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - How long refuse ye to keep my commandments! Though Moses is addressed, it is the people who are blamed. Hence the plural verb, \"refuse ye.\" Already there had been one act of disobedience in connection with the manna (see ver. 20) - now there was another - when would such sinful folly come to an end? When would the people learn that they could gain nothing by disobedience? It was \"long\" indeed before they were taught the lesson.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSee, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - See, for that, etc. Rather, \"See, that.\" Consider that God has given you the Sabbath, or the holy rest: and therefore it is that he gives you on the sixth day the food for two days - that the rest may not be interfered with. abide ye every man in his place. One Jewish sect, the Masbothei, took this command absolutely literally, and held that in whatsoever position a man was at the commencement of the Sabbath day, he was bound to retain it to the close. But generally it was held that the \"place\" intended was the camp, which the Israelites were forbidden to quit; and hence was derived the idea of the \"sabbath day's journey,\" which was reckoned at six stadia - the supposed distance of the furthest bounds of the camp from its centre.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the people rested on the seventh day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - So the people rested. Having found by experience that nothing was to be gained by seeking manna on the sabbath, and received the severe rebuke of verse 28, the people henceforth obeyed the new commandment, and \"rested on the sabbath day.\" Of the nature of the \"rest\" intended more will be said in the comment on Exodus 20:8-11.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 16:31-36NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-36. - THE APPEARANCE OF THE MANNA, ITS CONTINUANCE, AND ITS DEPOSITION IN THE TABERNACLE. - In bringing the subject of the manna to a conclusion, the writer adds a few words.NEWLINENEWLINE1. On its appearance;NEWLINENEWLINE2. On its deposition by divine command in the Ark of the Covenant; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. On its continuance during the forty years of the wanderings.NEWLINENEWLINEIt is evident that verses 32-34 cannot have been written until after the sojourn in Sinai, and the command to make a tabernacle (ch. 26.): as also that verse 35 cannot have been written till the arrival of the Israelites at the verge of the land of Canaan. But there is nothing in the passage that militates against the Mosaic authorship of the whole. Verse 31. - The house of Israel. This expression is unusual, and is not admitted by the Septuagint, the Syriac, or the Arabic versions, which all have \"the children of Israel.\" Several Hebrew MSS. have bent, \"sons,\" instead of beyth \"house.\" Manna. Literally, as in the Septuagint, man - the word used when they first beheld the substance (verse 15), and probably meaning \"a gift.:' The elongated form manna, first appears in the Sept. rendering of Numbers 11:6, 7. It was like coriander seed. This is \"a small round grain of a whitish or yellowish grey.\" The comparison is made again in Numbers 11:7, where it is added that the colour was that of bdellium - either the gum so called, or possibly the pearl. The taste of it was like wafers made with honey. Such wafers or cakes were constantly used as offerings by the Egyptians, Greeks, and other nations. They were ordinarily compounded of meal, oil, and honey. Hence we can reconcile with the present passage the statement in Numbers 11:8, that \"the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And Moses said. Not at the moment, but some time subsequently. See the introductory paragraph. Fill an omer. In the original it is \"the omer,\" and so the LXX.; but the reason for the introduction of the article is obscure. For your generations - i.e., \"for your descendants.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Take a pot. The word here translated \"pot\" does not occur elsewhere in Scripture, and is believed to be of Egyptian origin Gesenius translates it \"basket;\" but the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews 9:4 follows the LXX. in representing the word used by στάμνος, which certainly means \"a jar\" or \"pot.\" Lay it up before the Lord. The \"pot of manna\" was laid up before the Lord with the \"tables of the covenant,\" and \"Aaron's rod that budded\" as symbolical that God's mercy was as eternal and essential, and as much to be remembered as his justice, and perhaps also as especially symbolising the \"true bread of life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34, - Aaron laid it up before the testimony. \"The testimony\" is not the Ark of the Covenant, which is never so called, but the Covenant itself, or the two tables of stone engraved by the finger of God, which are termed \"the testimony\" in Exodus 25:16-21; Exodus 40:20; etc. The pot of manna was laid up inside the ark (Hebrews 9:4) in front of the two tables.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The children of Israel did eat manna forty years. Kalisch observes that the actual time was not forty full years, but about one month short of that period, since the manna began after the fifteenth day of the second month of the first year (verse 1) and terminated just after Passover of the forty-first year (Joshua 5:10-12). It may be added that Mesas cannot have written the present passage later than about the eleventh month of the fortieth year (Deuteronomy 1:3; Deuteronomy 34:10; Joshua 4:19); when the manna had continued thirty-nine years and nine months. Until they came to a land inhabited. Kalisch translates \"the land of their habitation,\" or \"which they were to inhabit,\" remarking that they had reached inhabited countries, e.g., those of Sihon and Og, much earlier. But the words will not bear this rendering. What the writer intends to note is, that the manna continued all the time they were in the wilderness, until they reached inhabited territory, and then further (in the next clause), that it lasted after that, until they came to the borders of Canaan. He does not say that it even then left off. He writes exactly as Moses might be expected to have written towards the close of his life. A later writer would, as Canon Cook observes, have been more specific.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus16:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - An omer. The \"omer\" must be distinguished from the \"homer\" of later times.

When the Israelites had come to Rephidim which was probably in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady Esh-Sheikh, complaint arose, not, as at Marah (Exodus 15:23), that there was no drinkable water, but that there was no water at all. Water had been expected, and consequently no supply had been brought; but none was found. Violent murmurs arose, and the people were ready to stone their leader (ver. 4), who had, they considered, brought them into the difficulty. As usual, Moses took his grief to God, and laid it before him, with the result that God gave miraculous relief. Moses was bidden to take his rod, and go with the elders to a particular rock known as \"the rock in Horeb\" (ver. 6), and there strike the rock, and water would flow forth. This he did, and a copious stream welled out, which furnished abundant drink to the whole multitude. In remembrance of the murmuring, he called the place Massah (trial) and Meribah (quarrel). Verse 1. - From the wilderness of Sin. See the comment on Exodus 16:1. The sandy coast tract (El Murka) was probably quitted in lat. 28° 42' nearly, and the Wady Feiran entered on at its south-western extremity. Two stations, Dophkah and Alush, lay between the Sin wilderness and Rephidim, as we learn from Numbers 33:12, 13. It is impossible to locate these places with exactness. After their journeys. The three stages - from Sin to Dophkah, from Dophkah to Alush, and from Alush to Rephidim - seem to be alluded to. According to the commandment of the Lord. Literally, \"at the mouth of Jehovah,\" i.e. as God ordered them. The command was signified by the movement of the \"pillar of the cloud.\" And pitched in Rephidim. The word Rephidim signifies \"resting places,\" and \"is the natural name for the paradise of the Bedouins in the palm-grove where the church and palace of the bishops of Paran formerly stood \"(Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 41). There was no water. The Wady Feiran is watered ordinarily by a copious stream; but at times the brook is dry (ibid. p. 40, note 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The people did chide. I.e. \"quarrelled,\" made open murmurs and complaint - as before frequently (Exodus 14:11, 12; Exodus 15:24; Exodus 16:2, 3). Give us water. As Moses had already given them flesh (the quails) and bread (the manna), so it perhaps seemed to the people easy that he should give them such a common thing as water. Stanley notices (p. 70) that the wadys suggest the idea of water, and make its absence the more intolerable - they are \"exactly like rivers,\" with \"torrent bed, and banks, and clefts in the rock for tributary streams, and at times even rushes and shrubs fringing their course\" - signs of \"water, water everywhere, yet not a drop to drink.\" Wherefore do ye tempt the Lord? To \"tempt the Lord\" is to try his patience by want of faith, to arouse his anger, to provoke him to punish us. It was the special sin of the Israelites during the whole period of their sojourn in the wilderness. They \"tempted and provoked the most high God\" (Psalm 78:56); \"provoked him to anger with their inventions\" (Psalm 106:29), \"murmured in their tents\" (ib, 25), \"provoked him at the sea\" (ib, 7), \"tempted him in the desert\" (ib, 14). God's long-suffering, notwithstanding all, is simply amazing!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The people thirsted there for water. There is probably no physical affliction comparable to intense thirst. His thirst was the only agony which drew from the Son of Man an acknowledgment of physical suffering, in the words \"I thirst.\" Descriptions of thirst in open boats at sea are among the most painful of the records of afflicted humanity. Thirst in the desert can scarcely be less horrible. The people murmured and said When the worst comes on men, if they are alone, they bear it silently; but if they can find a scapegoat, they murmur. To lay the blame of the situation on another is a huge satisfaction to the ordinary human mind, which shrinks from responsibility, and would fain shift the burthen on some one else. To kill us. Compare Exodus 14:11, 16:3. The circumstances of their life in the wilderness were such, that, until accustomed to them, the people thought that, at each step, they must perish. It may be freely admitted, that without continual miraculous aid this would have been the natural denouement. And our cattle. It is interesting to see that the \"cattle\" still survived, and were regarded as of great importance. How far they served as a secondary head of subsistance to the people during the 40 years, is a point not yet sufficiently elaborated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And Moses cried unto the Lord. It is one of the most prominent traits of the character of Moses, that, at the occurrence of a difficulty, he always carries it straight to God. (See Exodus 15:25; Exodus 24:15; Exodus 32:30; Exodus 33:8; Numbers 11:2, 11; Numbers 12:11; Numbers 14:13-19, etc.) They be almost ready to stone me. This is the first which we hear of stoning as a punishment. It is naturally one of the easiest modes of wreaking popular vengeance on an obnoxious individual, and was known to the Greeks as early as the time of the Persian war (Herod. 9:5), to the Macedonians (Q. Curt. Vit. Alex. 6:11, 38), and others. There is, however, no trace of it among the Egyptians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Go on before the people. \"Leave the people,\" i.e., \"where they are, in Rephidim, and go on in front of them, with some of the elders as witnesses, that the miracle may be sufficiently attested.\" On the other occasion, when water was brought forth out of the rock (Numbers 20:8-11), it was done in the presence of the people. Perhaps now there was a real danger of their stoning Moses, had he not quitted them. Thy rod with which thou smotest the river. See above, Exodus 7:20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Behold, I will stand before thee there. A visible Divine appearance seems to be intended, which would guide Moses to the exact place where he should strike. The rock in Horeb must have been a remarkable object, already known to Moses during the time that he dwelt in the Sinai-Horeb region; but its exact locality cannot be pointed out. It cannot, however, have been very far distant from Rephidim. (See ver. 8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - He called the name of the place Massah. Massah is from the root nasah, \"to try,\" or \"tempt,\" and means \"trial\" or \"temptation.\" Meribah is from rub, \"to chide, quarrel,\" and means \"contention, chiding, strife.\" Moses gave the same name to the place near Kadesh, where water was once more brought out of the rock, near the end of the wanderings. (See Numbers 20:13; Deuteronomy 32:51; Psalm 106:32.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 17:8-16NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-16. - THE WAR WITH AMALEK. The Amalekites seem to have been descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau (Genesis 36:12). They separated themselves off from the other Edomites at an early date, and became the predominant tribe in the more northern parts of the Sinaitic peninsula, claiming and exercising a sovereignty over the whole of the desert country between the borders of Palestine and Egypt. We do not find the name Amalek in the Egyptian records; but the people are probably represented by the Mentu, with whom so many of the early Egyptian kings contended. The Pharaohs dispossessed them of the north-western portion of the mountain region; but they probably claimed the suzerainty of the central hills and valleys, which the Egyptians never occupied; and on these they no doubt set a high value as affording water and pasture for their flocks during the height of summer. When the Israelites pressed forward into these parts, the Amale-kites, in spite of the fact that they were a kindred race, determined on giving them battle. They began by \"insidiously attacking the rear of the Hebrew army, when it was exhausted and weary\" (Deuteronomy 25:18). I-laving cut off many stragglers, they attacked the main body at Rephidim, in the Wady-Feiran, and fought the long battle which the text describes (vers. 10-13). The result was the complete discomfiture of the assailants, who thenceforth avoided all contact with Israel until attacked in their turn at the southern frontier of Canaan, when, in conjunction with the Canaanites, they were victorious (Numbers 14:45). A bitter and long continued enmity followed. Amalek, \"the first of the nations\" to attack Israel (Exodus 24:20), was pursued with unrelenting hostility (Deuteronomy 25:17-19), defeated repeatedly by Saul and David (1 Samuel 14:48; 1 Samuel 15:7; 1 Samuel 27:8; 1 Samuel 30:17; 2 Samuel 8:12); the last remnant of the nation being finally destroyed by the Simeonites in the reign of king Hezekiah, as related by the author of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 4:41-43). Verse 8. - Then came Amalek. The bulk of the Amalekites would have been passing the spring in the lower plains, where herbage is abundant after the early rains, while later in the year it dries up. They would hear of the threatened occupation of their precious summer pastures by the vast host of the Hebrews, and would seek to prevent it by blocking the way. Hence they are said to have \"come\" - i.e., to have marched into a position where they were not previously, though it was one situated within their country. We must remember that they were nomads. And fought with Israel For the nature of the fighting on the first day, see Deuteronomy 25:18; by which it appears that the original attack was made on the rear of the long column, and was successful. The Amalekites \"smote the hindmost\" of the Israelites, \"even all that were feeble behind them, when they were faint and weary.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And Moses said to Joshua. On hearing what had happened, Moses summoned to his presence an Ephraimite in the prime of life - about 45 years old - and devolved on him the military command. The man's name at the time was Hoshea or Oshea (Numbers 13:8). He was the son of a certain Nun (ibid.) or Non (1 Chronicles 7:27), and the tenth in descent from Ephraim, the son of Joseph (ib, 23-27). Some forty years later Moses changed his name from Hoshea to Jehoshua. which became contracted into Joshua. The occurrence of this form in the present passage may be accounted for.NEWLINENEWLINE1. By Moses having written (or reviewed) Exodus late in his life; orNEWLINENEWLINE2. By a later authorised reviser (Ezra?) having altered the text. Choose out for us men - i.e. \"Select from the congregation such a number of fit men as appear to thee sufficient, and with them fight Amalek.\" To-morrow. It was probably evening, when Moses heard of the attack on his rear, and there was consequently no possibility of retrieving the disaster till the next day. lie could but make his arrangements for retrieving it. I will stand on the top of the hill. It is implied that there was a conspicuous hill (gibeah), not a rock (tsur) in the near vicinity of Rephidim, whence Moses could see the fight, and be seen by those engaged in it. Dean Stanley finds all the conditions answered by an eminence on the south side of the Wady Feiran (Sinai and Palestine, p. 41). Others suggest the Jebel Tahuneh north of the same wady. With the rod of God in my hand. Moses meant to indicate by this, that he looked for victory to God alone, and did not trust in an \"arm of flesh,\" while, nevertheless, he sent his soldiers to the combat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hur. Hur has not been mentioned hitherto. According to one Jewish tradition, he was the son, according to another, the husband of Miriam. Scripture only tells us of him, that he was descended from Judah, through Caleb the son of Hezron (1 Chronicles 2:18-20), and that his grandson, Bezaleel, was the artificer of the tabernacle (Exodus 31:2). He is again associated with Aaron in Exodus 24:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - When Moses held up his hand,... Israel prevailed. The elevation of Moses' hand, with the rod held in it, was an appeal to God for aid, and must be supposed to have been accompanied by fervent prayer to God, that he would help his people and give them victory over their enemies. So long as the hand was upraised, the Israelites prevailed; not because they saw it, and took it as directing them to continue the fight (Kalisch), but because God gave them strength, and vigour and courage, while Moses interceded, and left them to themselves when the intercession ceased, It may be said, that Moses might have continued to pray, though his hands were weary; but only those who have tried, know how difficult a thing it is to pray with any intensity for a continuance. Probably Moses' spiritual and physical powers collapsed together; and when he dropped his hand through physical fatigue, he rested also from his mental effort. To impress upon Israel the importance of intercessory prayer, God made success and failure alternate with its continuance and discontinuance, thus teaching his people a lesson of inestimable value.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - But Moses' hands were heavy. Moses, no doubt, held the rod alternately with one hand and the other, until both were so tired that he could hold them up no longer. It is this natural weariness which is expressed by the words - \"his hands were heavy.\" When Aaron and Hut perceived this, they brought a stone for him to sit on, and then, standing one on either side of him, alternately supported his hands until the sun set and the battle was over. To reward the faith and perseverance of the three, God gave Israel in the end a complete victory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Amalek and his people - i.e. \"the Amalekites proper, and the tribes subject to them, who fought on their side.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Write this... in a book. The original has, \"Write this in the book.\" It is clear that a book already existed, in which Moses entered events of interest, and that now he was divinely commanded to record in it the great victory over Amalek, and the threat uttered against them. The record was to be for a memorial -NEWLINENEWLINE1. that the victory itself might be held in remembrance through all future ages, as a very signal instance of God's mercy; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. that when the fulfilment of the threat came (1 Chronicles 4:43), God might have his due honour, and his name be glorified. Rehearse it in the ears of Joshua. \"Hand down,\" i.e., to thy successor, Joshua, the tradition of perpetual hostility with Amalek, and the memory of the promise now made, that the whole nation shall be utterly blotted out from under heaven. (Compare Deuteronomy 25:19.) The special sin of Amalek was,NEWLINENEWLINE1. That he attacked God's people, not fearing God (ib, verse 18);NEWLINENEWLINE2. That he had no compassion on his own kindred: andNEWLINENEWLINE3. That he fell on them when they were already suffering affliction, and were \"feeble, and faint and weary\" (ib,)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Moses built an altar. An altar naturally implies a sacrifice, and Moses may well have thought that the signal victory obtained required to be acknowledged, and as it were requited, by offerings. In giving his altar a name, he followed the example of Jacob, who called an altar which he built, El-Elohe-Israel (Genesis 33:20). Moses' name for his altar, Jehovah-nisi, meant \"the Lord is my banner,\" and was intended to mark his ascription of the entire honour of the victory to Jehovah but had probably no reference to the particular mode in which the victory was gained.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Because the Lord hath sworn. Rather, as in the margin, \"Because the hand of Amalek was against the throne of the Lord\" - \"because,\" i.e., \"in attacking Israel, Amalek had as it were lifted up his hand against God on his throne,\" therefore should there be war against Amalek from generation to generation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law. Rather, \"Jethro, priest of Midian, Moses' brother-in-law.\" See the comment on Exodus 3:1; and note that the Seventy use the ambiguous word γαμβρός, while the Vulgate has cognatus. And that. Rather \"in that.\" The clause is exegetical of the preceding one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - After he had sent her back. Literally \"after her dismissal.\" It is curious that the fact of the dismissal had not been previously mentioned, yet is here assumed as known. Some commentators (as Knobel) find, in what is said of Zipporah, the trace of two distinct writers who give two contradictory narratives; but the difficulties and obscurities of the history are sufficiently intelligible, if we hear in mind -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That Moses was addressing immediately those who knew the facts; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. That he was studious of brevity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And her two sons. That Zipporah had borne Moses at least two sons before his return to Egypt from Midian, had appeared from Exodus 4:20. The name of the one, Gershom, and the ground of it, had been declared in Exodus 2:22. The repetition here may be accounted for by the present chapter having been originally a distinct and separate composition, written on a distinct roll, and subsequently incorporated by Moses into his great work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Eliezer. Eliezer had not been previously mentioned by name; but he was probably the son circumcised by Zipporah, as related in ch. 4:25. We learn from 1 Chronicles 23:15-17, that he grew to manhood, and had an only son, Rehabiah, whose descendants were in the time of Solomon very numerous. For the God of my father, said he, was my help. Eliezer means literally, \"My God (is my) help.\" It would seem that Zipporah, when she circumcised her infant son, omitted to name him; but Moses, before dismissing her, supplied the omission, calling him Eliezer, because God had been his help against the Pharaoh who had sought his life (Exodus 2:15), and of whose death he had recently had intelligence (Exodus 4:19). Thus the names of the two sons expressed respectively, the despondency natural to an exile, and the exultant gratitude of one who had just learned that by God's goodness, the term of his banishment was over.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5.- The wilderness. This term, which has the article, seems to be here used in that wide sense with which we are familiar from Exodus 3:18; VERSETITLESTARTVERSETITLEENDExodus 18:6NEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And he said. It is suspected that the true reading here is, \"and they said,\" - i.e., some one said - \"to Moses, behold thy father-in-law\" (or \"brother-in-law\"), \"Jethro, is come unto thee.\" So the LXX., and many moderns, as Kennicott, Geddes, Boothroyd, Canon Cook, and others. But the explanation, that Jethro, on arriving in the vicinity of Moses, sent a messenger to him, who spoke in his name (Rosenmuller, Patrick, Pool, Kalisch, Keil, etc.) is at any rate plausible, and removes all necessity of altering the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. Oriental ideas of politeness require such a movement in case of an honoured or even of a welcome visitor (see Genesis 18:2; Genesis 19:1; Genesis 32:6; Genesis 33:1; Luke 15:20; etc.). It was evidently the intention of Moses to receive Jethro with all possible marks of honour and respect. He not only went out to meet him, but did obeisance to him, as to a superior. They asked each other of their welfare. Rather \"exchanged salutations;\" addressed each other mutually with the customary phrase \"Peace he unto you.\" Came into the tent - i.e., went together into the tent of Moses, which had been already glanced at in the word \"encamped\" (verse 5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moses told his father-in-law. Jethro had heard in Midian the general outline of what had happened (verse 1). Moses now gave him a full and complete narrative (misphar) of the transactions. Compare Genesis 24:66; Joshua 2:23; where the same verb is used. All the travail. Literally, \"the weariness.\" Compare Malachi 1:13, where the same word is used. The Lord delivered them. The Septuagint adds \"from the hand of Pharaoh and from the hand of the Egyptians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Blessed be the Lord. Compare Genesis 14:20; Genesis 24:27. The heathen blessed God no loss than the Israelites; but Jethro's blessing the Lord (i.e. Jehovah) is unusual As, however, Moses had attributed his own deliverance, and that of Israel, entirely to Jehovah (verse 8), Jethro, accepting the facts to be as stated, blessed the Lord. Who hath delivered you. Kalisch takes the plural pronoun to refer to Moses and Aaron; but Aaron seems not to nave been present, since he afterwards \"came\" (verse 12). It is better to regard Jethro as addressing all those who were in the tent with Moses. From them he goes on in the last clause to \"the people.\" And out of the hand of Pharaoh. - i.e., especially out of the hand of Pharaoh, who had especially sought their destruction (Exodus 14:6, 8, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now know I that the Lord is greater than all gods. It would seem that Jethro, like the generality of the heathen, believed in a plurality of gods, and had hitherto regarded the God of the Israelites as merely one among many equals. Now, he renounces this creed, and emphatically declares his belief that Jehovah is above all other gods, greater, higher, more powerful. Compare the confessions of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2:47; Daniel 3:26, 27) and Darius the Mede (Daniel 6:26). For in the thing wherein they dealt wickedly he was above them. There is no \"he was above them\" in the original, nor is the clause a distinct sentence from the preceding one. It is merely a prolongation of that clause, without any new verb; and should be translated, \"Even in the very matter that they (the Egyptians) dealt proudly against them \"(the Israelites). The superiority of Jehovah to other gods was shown forth even in the very matter of the proud dealing of the Egyptians, which was brought to shame and triumphed over by the might of Jehovah. The allusion is especially to the passage of the Red Sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Jethro took a burnt offering. Or \"brought a burnt offering;\" as the same verb is rendered in Exodus 25:2. It is not distinctly related that he offered the victim; but as no other offerer is mentioned, and as he was a priest (Exodus 3:1; Exodus 18:1), we may assume that he did so. Moses, Aaron, and the elders, partook of the sacrificial meal, regarding the whole rite as one legitimately performed by a duly qualified person, and so as one in which they could properly participate. Jethro, like Melchisedek (Genesis 14:18), was recognised as a priest of the true God, though it would seem that the Midianites generally were, a generation later, idolaters (Numbers 25:18; Numbers 31:16). To eat bread... before God. This expression designates the feast upon a sacrifice, which was the universal custom of ancient nations, whether Egyptians, Assyrians, Phenicians, Persians, Greeks, or Romans. Except in the case of the \"whole burnt offering\" (ὁλοκαύτωμα), parts only of the animals were burnt, the greater portion of the meat being consumed, with bread, at a meal, by the offerer and his friends and relativesNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 18:13-26NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-26. - JETHRO'S ADVICE TO MOSES, AND ITS ADOPTION. The office of ruler in ancient times, whether exercised by a king, a prince, or a mere chieftain, was always understood to include within it the office of judge. In the Greek ideal of the origin of kingly government (Herod. 1:96), the able discharge of judicial functions marks the individual out for sovereignty. The successors of Moses, like the chief rulers of Carthage, bore the title of \"Judges\" (shophetim, suffetes). Moses, it appears, had from the time when he was accepted as leader by the people (Exodus 4:29-31), regarded himself as bound to hear and decide all the causes and complaints which arose among the entire Israelite people. He had net delegated his authority to any one. This can scarcely have been because the idea had not occurred to him, for the Egyptian kings ordinarily decided causes by judges nominated ad hoc. Perhaps he had distrusted the ability of his countrymen - so recently slaves - to discharge such delicate functions. At any rate, he had reserved the duty wholly to himself (ver. 18). This course appeared to Jethro unwise. No man could, he thought, in the case of so great a nation, singly discharge such an office with satisfaction to himself and others. Moses would \"wear himself away\" with the fatigue; and he would exhaust the patience of the people through inability to keep pace with the number of cases that necessarily arose. Jethro therefore recommended the appointment of subordinate judges, and the reservation by Moses of nothing but the right to decide such cases as these judges should, on account of their difficulty, refer to him (ver. 22) On reflection, Moses accepted this course as the best open to him under the circumstances, and established a multiplicity of judges, under a system which will be discussed in the comment on verse 25. Verse 13. - On the morrow. The day after Jethro's arrival. Moses sat to judge the people. Moses, i.e., took his seat in an accustomed place, probably at the door of his tent, and. was understood to be ready to hear and decide causes. The people stood by Moses. A crowd of complainants soon collected, and kept Moses employed incessantly from the morning, when he had taken his seat, until the evening, i.e., until nightfall. It is conjectured that many complaints may have arisen out of the division of the spoil of the Amalekites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Why sittest thou thyself alone etc. A perverse ingenuity has discovered that the emphatic words in this passage are \"sittest\" and \"stand,\" Jethro having blamed Moses for humiliating the people by requiring them to stand up while he himself sat! But the context makes it abundantly clear that what Jethro really blames, is Moses sitting alone and judging the whole people single-handed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And Moses said... Because the people come unto me, to inquire of God. To inquire of God is certainly not a mere \"juridical phrase,\" meaning to consult a judge (Kalisch), nor, on the other hand, is it necessarily \"to consult God through an oracle.\" It cannot, however, mean less than to seek a decision from some one regarded as entitled to speak for God; and it is certainly assigned by Moses as the reason why he judged all the causes himself, and did not devolve the duty upon others. They could not be supposed to know the mind of God as he knew it. Jethro, however, points out, that it is one thing to lay down principles, and another to apply them. Moses might reserve the legislative function - the inculcation of principles - to himself, and so still, \"be for the people to Godward\" (ver. 19); but he might find \"able men\" among the congregation, quite capable of applying the principles, and delegate to them the judicial function (vers. 21, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I judge... and I do make them know the statutes of God. As the israelites were, up to this time, without any code of written laws, Moses took the opportunity furnished by such cases as came before him, to lay down principles of law, and enjoin them upon the people; thus making them to know the statutes of God and his eternal unwritten laws. Such a practice would not have been necessary after the giving of the law on Mount Sinai; and its existence at the time of Jethro's visit helps to fix that visit as occurring before the giving of the law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The thing... is not good - i.e., not expedient, and so not the right thing to do. It is a man's duty to have regard to his health, and not unnecessarily overtask his strength. Verse 18. - Thou wilt surely wear away. Literally, \"Wasting thou wilt waste away,\" Thy strength, i.e., will not long hold out, if thou continuest this practice. Both thou, and this people.

The separation of the legislative and judicial functions was well known in Egypt, where the kings alone made new laws (Herod. 2:109, 136, 177, etc.), but causes were ordinarily determined by a body of judges. Bring the causes unto God. In difficult cases, Moses actually laid the cause before God, and obtained directions from God as to the manner in which he was to decide it. See Numbers 27:5-11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws. Or, \"statutes and laws,\" as in ver. 16. It is not quite clear how these differ. Some regard \"statutes\" as connected with religion, and laws as regulations with respect to civil and social matters. Others explain the first as \"specific\" and the second as \"general enactments.\" The way wherein they must walk. The general line of conduct which all axe bound to pursue. The work that they must do. The special task which each has to perform individually.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Able men. Literally, \"men of might\" - i.e., of capacity or ability - men competent for the office of judge; who are further defined to be, such as possess the three qualities of piety, veracity, and strict honesty, or incorruptness. Jethro's conception of the true judicial character leaves little to be desired. If among every ten Israelites there was one such person, the moral condition of the nation cannot have been so much depressed by the Egyptian servitude as is sometimes represented. Place such over them to be rulers of thousands, etc. A decimal organisation naturally presents itself to men's minds as the simplest in a simple state of society, and was probably already in use among the Arab tribes with whom Jethro was familiar. The graduated series - rulers of tens, of fifties, of hundreds, and of thousands, implies a power of three-fold appeal, from the \"ruler of ten\" to the \"ruler of fifty\" - from him to the \"ruler of a hundred\" - and from him to the \"ruler of a thousand.\" Whether there was an appeal from the last-named to Moses, is doubtful. Probably there was not; Moses deciding those cases only which the \"rulers of thousands\" reserved for him as being specially difficult or important.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let them judge the people at all seasons. Instead of occasional court-days, on which Moses sat from morning to evening hearing causes, judgments were to be given continually by the rulers of tens, fifties, etc., the accumulation of untried causes being thus avoided, and punishment following promptly on the committal of an offence. The elaborately minute organisation was only suited for the period of the wanderings, and was of a semi-military character, such as might have suited an army on the march When the Israelites became settled dwellers in Palestine, such a multiplicity of judges was unnecessary, and was discontinued. So shall it be easier. Literally, \"So make it easier.\" Compare ver. 18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And God command thee so. Jethro does not suppose that Moses will take his advice without further consultation. He assumes that the matter will be laid by Moses before God, and God's will learnt concerning it. The entire narrative supposes that there was some established means by which the Israelite leader could refer a matter to Jehovah and obtain a decision upon it. This can scarcely have been as yet the Urim and Thummim. Probably Moses held frequent communication with Jehovah by means of waking visions. Thou shalt be able to endure - i.e., \"the work will not be too much for thee - thou wilt be able to bear it.\" This people shall also go to their place in peace. The \"place\" intended would seem to be Palestine. Keil supposes that the word \"peace\" is to be taken literally, and concludes from it that breaches of the peace had previously been frequent, the people having \"often taken the law into their own hands on account of the delay in the judicial decision;\" but this is to extract from the words more than they naturally signify. \"In peace\" means \"cheerfully, contentedly.\" If the changes which he recommends are carried out, Jethro thinks that the people will make the rest of the journey to Canaan quietly and contentedly, without complaint or dissatisfaction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - So Moses hearkened. Moses took the advice tendered him, not immediately, but after the law had been given at Sinai, and the journeying was about to be resumed. See Deuteronomy 1:9-15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Moses chose able men. It appears from Deuteronomy 1:13, that instead of selecting the men himself, which would have been an invidious task, Moses directed their nomination by the people, and only reserved to himself the investing them wit h their authority. Heads over the people. From the time of their appointment, the \"rulers\" were not merely judges, but \"heads\" of their respective companies, with authority over them on the march, and command in the battle-field (Numbers 31:14). Thus the organisation was at once civil and military.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - At all seasons. See the comment on verse 22. The hard causes they brought unto Moses. It must have been left to the discretion of the judges to determine whether a cause was hard or easy, a great or a little matter. Probably only those causes which seemed \"hard\" to the \"rulers of thousands\" were brought before Moses for decision.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 18:27NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - DEPARTURE OF JETHRO. The time of Jethro's departure, and indeed of his entire visit, has been matter of controversy. Kurtz is of opinion that Jethro waited till the news of Israel's victory over Amalek reached him, before setting out from his own country. Hence he concludes, that \"a whole month or more may easily have intervened between the victory over Amalek and the arrival of Jethro,\" whose arrival in that case \"would not even fall into the very earliest period of the sojourn at Sinai, but after the promulgation of the first Sinaitic law.\" Those who identify Hobab with Jethro find in Numbers 10:29-32 a proof that at any rate Jethro prolonged his visit until after the law was given, and did not \"depart to his own land\" before the removal of the people from the wilderness of Sinai to that of Paran, \"in the 20th day of the second month of the second year\" (ib, ver. 11). The position, however, of ch. 18, together with its contents - beth what it says and what it omits - are conclusive against this view. Jethro started on his journey when he heard \"that the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt\" (ver. 1), not when he heard that Israel had been victorious over Amalek. His conversation with Moses (vers. 7-11) ranged over the entire series of deliverances from the night of the departure out of Egypt to the Amalekite defeat, but contained no allusion to the giving of the law. The occupation of Moses on the day after his arrival (ver. 13) is suitable to the quiet period which followed the Amalekite defeat, but not to the exciting time of the Sinaitic manifestations. It may be added that the practice of inculcating general principles on occasion of his particular judgments, of which Moses speaks (ver. 16), is suitable to the period anterior to the promulgation of the law, but not to that following it. The argument from Numbers 10:29-32 fails altogether, so soon as it is seen that Jethro and Hobab are distinct persons, probably brothers, sons of Reuel (or Raguel), and brothers- in-law of Moses. Verse 27. - Moses let his father-in-law depart. Literally, \"dismissed him,\" \"sent him away.\" This single expression is quite enough to prove that the Hobab, whom Moses made strenuous efforts to keep with him after Sinai was left, is not the Jethro whom he was quite content to let go. He went his way into his own land. He returned to Midian, probably crossing the Elanitic gulf, which divided Midian from the Sinaitic region. The exact time of the departure is uncertain; but it was probably before the main events related in ch. 19.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - In the third month.

The bulk of the tents were no doubt pitched in the plain, Er-Rahah; but this may not have sufficed, and some may have been located in the Wady-ed-Deir, north-east of the Ras Sufsafeh, and others in the Seil-Leja to the west. The Ras Sufsafeh is visible from both these valleys.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 19:3-9NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3-9. - THE FIRST COVENANT BETWEEN GOD AND ISRAEL. AS Moses, having reached the foot of Sinai, was proceeding to ascend the mountain, where he looked to have special revelations from God, God called to him out of the mountain, and required a positive engagement on the part of the people, before he would condescend to enter into further direct relations with them. If, through gratitude for what had been done for them in the deliverance from Egypt, and since, they would solemnly engage to obey God and keep the covenant that he should make with them (verse 5), then a fresh revelation should be made, and fresh engagements entered into; but not otherwise. Moses communicated the message to the people through the alders, and received the solemn promise, which he carried back to God. \"All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.\" Verse 3. - Moses went up unto God. From the time of his call Moses had known that Israel was to serve God upon Sinai (Exodus 3:12), and had regarded either one special peak, or the whole range as \"the mount of God\" - a place dedicated and set apart to Jehovah. It was natural, therefore, that, so soon as he reached the near vicinity of the mount, he should ascend it. The Lord called to him out of the Mount. God often accepts the will for the deed, and spares his saints a needless toil. Here, as Moses was on his way, God anticipated him, and calling to him out of the mountain sent him back to the people with a message. The house of Jacob. This rare expression, familiar to no sacred writer but Isaiah, recalls the promises made to Jacob of a numerous seed, which should grow from a house to a nation (Genesis 28:14; Genesis 35:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians.

In the fewest possible words he recalls to their recollection the whole series of signs and wonders wrought in Egypt, from the turning of the water into blood to the destruction of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea. These, he implies, ought to have taught them to trust him. I bare you on eagle's wings (compare Deuteronomy 32:11), where the metaphor is expanded at considerable length The strength and might of God's sustaining care, and its loving tenderness, are especially glanced at in the comparison. Brought you unto myself. \"Brought you,\" i.e., \"to Sinai, the mount of God, where it pleases me especially to reveal myself to you.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Now therefore. Instead of asking the simple question - \"Will ye promise to obey me and keep my covenant. - God graciously entices the Israelites to their own advantage by a most loving promise. If they will agree to obey his voice, and accept and keep his covenant, then they shall be to him a peculiar treasure (segullah) - a precious possession to be esteemed highly and carefully guarded from all that might injure it. (Compare Psalm 135:4; and see also Isaiah 43:1-4.) and this preciousness they shall not share with others on equal terms, but enjoy exclusively - it shall be theirs above all people. No other nation on the earth shall hold the position which they shall hold, or be equally precious in God's sight. All the earth is his: and so all nations are his in a certain sense. But this shall not interfere with the special Israelite prerogative they alone shall be his \"peculiar people\" (Deuteronomy 14:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests. Or \"a royalty of priests\" - at once a royal and a priestly race - all of you at once both priests and kings. (So the LXX. render, βασίλειον ἱεράτευμα; the Targums of Onkelos and Jerusalem, \"kings and priests;\" that of Jonathan, \"crowned kings and ministering priests.\") They would be \"kings,\" not only as \"lords over death, the devil, hell, and all evil\" (Luther), but also partly as having no earthly king set over them, but designed to live under a theocracy (1 Samuel 12:12), and partly as intended to exercise lordship over the heathen. Their unfaithfulness and disobedience soon forfeited both privileges. They would be \"priests,\" as entitled - each one of them - to draw near to God directly in prayer and praise, though not in sacrifice, and also as intermediaries between God and the heathen world, to whom they were to be examples, instructors, prophets. And an holy nation. A nation unlike other nations - a nation consecrated to God's service, outwardly marked as his by the symbol of circumcision, his (if they chose) inwardly by the purity and holiness whereto they could attain. These are the words. Much speaking was not needed. The question was a very simple one. Would they accept the covenant or no, upon the conditions offered? It was not likely that they would reject such gracious proposals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And Moses came. Moses descended from the point of the mountain which he had reached, and summoned a meeting of the elders of the people. When they were come together, he reported to them totidem verbis the message which he had received from God. He is said to have laid the words \"before their faces\" - a Hebraism, meaning simply \"before them.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And all the people answered together. It would seem that the elders submitted to the whole congregation the question propounded by Moses; or at any rate submitted it to a popular meeting, fairly representing the congregation. No doubt the exact purport of the question was made known by the usual means beforehand, and the assembly was summoned to declare, by acclamation, its assent or dissent. The result was a unanimous shout of approval: - \"All that the Lord hath spoken we will do\" - i.e., \"we will obey his voice indeed, and keep his covenant\" (see ver. 5). In this way they accepted the covenant beforehand, not knowing what its exact provisions would be, but assured in their hearts that all would be right, just, and good; and anxious to secure the promised blessings (vers. 5, 6) for themselves and their posterity Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord - i.e., Moses was the mouthpiece both ways. He took the messages of God to the people, and carried back (\"returned\") their answer.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I came unto thee in a thick cloud. Literally, \"in the thickness of a cloud.\" God must always veil himself when he speaks with man, for man could not bear \"the brightness of his presence.\" If he takes a human form that form is a veil; if he appears in a burning bush, the very. fire is a shroud. On the present occasion it was the more needful that he should cover himself up, as he was about to draw near to the whole congregation, among whom were many-who were impure and impenitent. It was necessary, in order that all might be convinced of the Divine mission of Moses, for all to be so near as to hear him speak out of the cloud; but sinners cannot abide the near presence of God, unless he is carefully hidden away from them. Probably, the cloud out of which he now spoke was that which had accompanied the Israelites out of Egypt, and directed their march (Exodus 13:21, 22), though this is not distinctly stated. That the people may believe thee for ever. In \"the people\" are included their descendants; and they are to \"believe Moses for ever, because the law is in some sense of eternal obligation on all men\" (Matthew 5:18). And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord. It is not easy to assign a reason for the repetition of this clause from vers. 8, in almost identical terms. There were no fresh \"words of the people\" to report. We can only say that such seemingly needless repetitions are in the manner of archaic writers, who seem to intend in this way to emphasise a fact. The acceptance of the covenant by the people beforehand, completed by Moses reporting it to God, is the necessary basis of all that follows - the required preliminary to the giving of any covenant at all.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 19:10-15NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-15. - THE PREPARATION OF THE PEOPLE AND OF THE MOUNTAIN FOR THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD UPON IT. The people having accepted God's terms, the time had come for the revelation in all its fulness of the covenant which God designed to make with them. This, it was essential, they should perceive and know to come from God, and not to be the invention of Moses. God, therefore, was about to manifest himself. But ere he could do this with safety, it was requisite that certain preparations should be made. Before man can be fit to approach God, he needs to be sanctified. The essential sanctification is internal; but, as internal purity and holiness cannot be produced at a given moment, Moses was ordered to require its outward symbol, external bodily cleanliness, by ablution and the washing of clothes, as a preliminary to God's descent upon the mountain (vers. 10, 13). It would be generally understood that this external purity was symbolical only, and needed to be accompanied by internal cleanliness. Further, since even the purest of men is impure in God's sight, and since there would be many in the congregation who had attempted no internal cleansing, it was necessary to provide that they should not draw too near, so as to intrude on the holy ground or on God's presence. Moses was therefore required to have a fence erected round the mountain, between it and the people, and to proclaim the penalty of death against all who should pass it and touch the mount (vers. 12, 13). In executing these orders, Moses gave an additional charge to the heads of families, that they should purify themselves by an act of abstinence which he specified (ver. 15) Verse 10. - Go unto the people. Moses had withdrawn himself from the people to report their words to God (vers. 8, 9). He was now commanded to return to them. Sanctify them. Or \"purify them.\" Purification in Egypt was partly by washing, partly, by shaving the hair, either front the head only, or from the entire body (Herod. 2:37), partly perhaps by other rites. The Israelites seem ordinarily to have purified themselves by washing only. To-day and to-morrow. The fourth and fifth of Sivan, according to the Jewish tradition, the Decalogue having been given upon the sixth. The requirement of a two-days' preparation marked the extreme sanctity of the occasion. Let them wash their clothes. Compare Leviticus 15:5. Rich people could \"change their garments\" on a sacred occasion (Genesis 35:2); the poorer sort, having no change, could only wash them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord win come down. Jehovah is regarded as dwelling in the heaven above, not exclusively (Psalm 139:7-10), but especially and therefore, when he appears on earth, he \"comes down\" (Genesis 11:5-7; Genesis 18:21; Exodus 3:8; etc.). In the sight of all the people. That a visible manifestation of the Divine presence is intended appears, unmistakably, from verses 16 and 18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou shalt set bounds. The erection of a fence or barrier, between the camp and the mountain - not necessarily all round the mountain - seems to be meant. This barrier may have run along the line of low alluvial mounds at the foot of the cliff of Ras Sufsafeh, mentioned by Dean Stanley (Sinai and Palestine, p. 43), but cannot have been identical with them, since it was an artificial fence. That ye go not up into the mount. Curiosity might have tempted some to ascend the mount, if it had not been positively forbidden under the penalty of death; carelessness might have brought many into contact with it, since the cliff rises abruptly from the plain. Unless the fence had been made, cattle would, naturally, have grazed along its base. To impress the Israelites with a due sense of the awful majesty of God, and the sacredness of everything material that it brought into close relations with him, the mount itself was declared holy - none but Moses and Aaron might go up into it; none might touch it; even the stray beast that approached it must suffer death for its unwitting offence (ver. 13). Whosoever toucheth the mount. The mountain may be \"touched\" from the plain - it rises so abruptly. Shall be surely put to death. A terrible punishment, and one which, to modern ideas, seems excessive. But it was only by terrible threats, and in some cases by terrible punishments (2 Samuel 6:7), that the Israelites could be taught reverence. A profound reverence lies at the root of all true religious feeling; and for the education of the world, it was requisite, in the early ages, to inculcate the necessity of this frame of mind in some very marked and striking way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - There shall not an hand touch it. Rather, \"there shall not an hand touch him.\" The transgressor shall not be seized and apprehended, for that would involve the repetition of the offence by his arrester, who must overpass the \"bounds\" set by Moses, in order to make the arrest. Instead of seizing him, they were to kill him with stones or arrows from within the \"bounds,\" and the same was to be done, if any stray beast approached the mountain. When the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. By translating the same Hebrew phrase differently here and in verse 12, the A. V. avoids the difficulty which most commentators see in this passage. According to the apparent construction, the people are first told that they may, on no account, ascend the mountain (ver. ,12), and then that they may do so, so soon as the trumpet sounds long (ver. 13). But they do not ascend at that time (ver. 19), nor are they allowed to do so - on the contrary, Moses is charged anew to prevent it (ver. 21-25); nor indeed do the people ever ascend, but only Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy eiders (Exodus 24:1, 2). What, then, is the permission here given? When we scrutinise the passage closely, we observe that the pronoun \"they\" is in the Hebrew, emphatic, and, therefore, unlikely to refer to \"the people\" of ver. 12. To whom then does it refer? Not, certainly, to \"the Elders\" of ver. 7, which would be too remote an antecedent, but to those chosen persons who are in the writer's mind, whom God was about to allow to ascend. Even these were not allowed to go up until summoned by the prolonged blast of the trumpet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In obedience to the commands which he had received (ver. 10), Moses returned to the camp at the foot of Sinai, and issued the order that the people were to purify themselves and wash their garments during that day and the next, and be ready for a great solemnity on the third day. He must also, at the same time, have given directions for the construction of the fence, which was to hedge in the people (ver. 12), and which he speaks of as constructed in ver. 23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Come not at your wives. Compare 1 Samuel 21:4, 5; 1 Corinthians 7:5. A similar obligation lay on the Egyptian priests (Porphyr. De Abstin. 4:7); and the idea which underlies it was widespread in the ancient world (See Herod. 1:198; Hesiod. Op. et Di. 733-4; Tibul. Carm. 2:1; 51:11, 12.) The subject is well treated, from a Christian point of view, by Pope Gregory the First, in his answers to S. Augustine's questions (Bode, Hist. Eccl. 2.).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 19:16-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-20. - THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD UPON SINAI. All was ready. The fence had been made (ver. 23); the people had purified themselves - at least so far as externals went. The third day was come - there was a breathless hush of expectation. Then suddenly, in the morning, the presence manifested itself. \"There were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud\" (ver. 16); \"and Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly\" (ver. 18) Or, as the scene is elsewhere (Deuteronomy 4:11, 12) described by Moses - \"Ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. And the Lord spoke unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.\" The phenomena were not a mere \"storm of thunder and lightning, whereof Moses took advantage to persuade the people that they had heard God's voice\" - not \"an earthquake with volcanic eruptions\" - not even these two combined - but a real theophany, in which amid the phenomena of storm and tempest, and fire and smoke, and thick darkness, and hearings of the ground as by an earthquake shock, first the loud blast of a trumpet sounded long commanding attention, and then a clear penetrating voice, like that of a man, made itself heard in distinctly articulated words, audible to the whole multitude, and recognised by them as superhuman - as \"the voice of God\" (Deuteronomy 4:33). It is in vain to seek to minimise, and to rationalise the scene, and tone it down into something not supernatural. The only honest course is either to accept it as a plain record of plain (albeit miraculous) facts, or to reject it altogether as the fiction of a romancer. Verse 16. - There were thunders. Literally, \"voices,\" as in Exodus 9:23; but there can be no doubt that \"thunder\" is meant. A thick cloud. Compare above, ver. 9, and the comment ad loc. The voice of the trumpet. Literally, \"a trumpet's voice.\" The word used for \"trumpet\" is not the same as in ver. 13; but the variation does not seem to have any importance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Moses brought forth the people out of the camp. The camp itself must have been withdrawn to some little distance from the foot of the mount, so that a vacant space intervened between the first tents and the \"fence\" which Moses had caused to be erected almost close to the mount. Into this vacant space Moses now led \"the people\" - i.e., the chief of the people - so bringing them as near as they might come to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke. Literally, smoked, all of it. Kalisch suggests that \"the dense clouds from which the thunders broke forth had the appearance of smoke.\" But the reason assigned - \"because the Lord descended on it in fire,\" seems to imply real smoke; and. the same re-suits from the comparison of it to \"the smoke of a furnace.\" The whole mount quaked greatly. Scarcely \"through the vehemence of the thunder\" (Kalisch), for thunder does not shake the earth, though it shakes the air - but rather by an actual earthquake. Compare Psalm 18:7; Matthew 27:51-54; Acts 4:31; Acts 16:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - When the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder. This is a somewhat free translation; but it gives well the real meaning of the Hebrew. We may conclude that the trumpet's blast was not continuous. It sounded when the manifestation began (ver. 16). It sounded again, much louder and with a much more prolonged note, to herald the actual descent of God upon the mount. This time the sound was so piercing, so terrible, so intolerable, that Moses could no longer endure to keep silence, but burst out in speech. Were his words those recorded in Hebrews 12:21 - \"I exceedingly fear and quake\" - words not found now in the Old Testament - or were they others which have been wholly lost to us? It is impossible to say. His speech, however, had the effect of bringing the awful preparations to a close - \"Moses spake, and God. answered him by a voice, and the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - On the top of the mount. Not, probably, on the highest point of the Sinaitic group, the Jebel Musa, which is out of sight from the plain Er-Rahah, where the Israelites must have been assembled; but on the highest part of the face of Sinai fronting that plain, the Ras Sufsafeh, which would be to the Israelites at the base \"the top of the mount.\" The Lord called Moses up. Perhaps with Aaron, who certainly accompanied him when he next ascended (ver. 24), and who seems to be glanced at in the phrase used at the end of ver. 23NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 19:21-25NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-25. - The further warning to the people and the priests. It is very remarkable that, after all the directions given (vers. 10-13), and all the pains taken by Moses and the Israelites themselves (vers. 14, 15, 23), God should still have thought it necessary to interpose with a fresh warning, and to send Moses back from the top of the mount to the bottom, in order to communicate the renewed warning to the people. We can only suppose that, in spite of the instructions previously given and the precautions taken, there were those among the people who were prepared to \"break through\" the fence, and invade the mount, and who would have done so, to their own destruction (ver. 21), but for this second warning. The special mention of the \"priests\" (vers. 22, 24) raises the suspicion, that this proud and rebellious spirit was particularly developed among them. Accustomed to the exercise of sacred functions, they may have been inclined to regard their own purity as equal to that of Moses and Aaron; and they may even have resented their exclusion from a sacred spot to which the two sons of Amram were admitted. Apparently, they had conceived that the injunction to go through the recognised ceremonies of purification (ver. 10) did not apply to them, and had neglected to do so, on which account a special command had to be issued, addressed to them only (ver. 22). Verse 21. - Charge the people lest they break through - i.e., \"lest they force a passage through the barrier made by Moses\" in accordance with the command given in ver. 12. And many of them perish. Irreverent gazing on holy things was forbidden by the law (Numbers 4:20), and on one occasion (1 Samuel 6:19) was actually punished with death. It did not, however, require a law to make it an offence, natural reason being quite sufficient to teach the duty of reverence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let the priests also. It has been objected, that no priests had been as yet appointed, and that we have here therefore an anachronism. But every nation in ancient times had priests, appointed on one principle or another: and the Levitical priesthood must be regarded as having superseded one previously existent, not as the first priesthood known to Israel. We have a second mention of priests, previous to the appointment of Aaron's sons to the office (in Exodus 24:5), which confirms the present passage. Sanctify themselves. The verb used is identical with that which occurs in ver. 10; and there is no reason to believe that any different sanctification was intended. The natural inference is that the priests had neglected to sanctify themselves. (See the introductory paragraph.) Lest the Lord break forth. Compare 2 Samuel 6:8, where we have an instance of such a \"breaking forth\" upon Uzzah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The people cannot come up. Moses can only have meant, that the people could not approach the mount unwittingly, since the fence commanded (ver. 12) was made. But to scale the fence, or break through it, was of course possible. (See ver 13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And the Lord said... Away, Get thee down. God wholly rejected the plea of Moses, that there was no need to give an additional warning. He knew best, and would not have issued the order to \"go down and charge the people \"(ver. 21), unless there had been a need for it. In the abrupt words \"Away, get thee down,\" we may see a rebuke, addressed to Moses, for his folly in thinking that he could change the purposes of God. Thou and Aaron with thee. This is the first express mention of Aaron as called to ascend with Moses. But it is quite possible that he may have accompanied his brother in either or both the previous ascents (vers. 3, 20. Compare Exodus 10:1, 3; Exodus 12:21, 28; etc.) But let not the priests and the people break through. Both the priests and the people were to be again solemnly warned that it would be death to break through the fence. This warning seems to have been sufficient.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - So Moses went down. After the sharp rebuke addressed to him in ver. 24, Moses made no further resistance, but returned to the camp, delivered the warning to priests and people, and having so done re-ascended the mount with Aaron.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now these are the names. Literally, \"And these are the names.\" Compare Genesis 46:8, where the phrase used is the same. We have here the first example of that almost universal practice of fife writers of the Historical Scriptures to connect book with book in the closest possible way by the simple copulative \"and.\" (Compare Joshua 1:1, Judges 1:1, Ruth, Samuel, Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.) This practice, so unlike that of secular writers, can only be explained by the instinctive feeling of all, that they were contributors to a single book, each later writer a continuator of the narrative placed on record by his predecessor. In the Pentateuch, if we admit a single author, the initial vau will be less remarkable, since it will merely serve to join together the different sections of a single treatise. Which came into Egypt. The next two words of the original, \"with Jacob,\" belong properly to this clause. The whole verse is best translated, \"Now these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt with Jacob: they came every man with his household.\" So the LXX., Pagnini, Kalisch, Geddes, Boothroyd, etc. Every man and his household. This is important in connection with the vexed question of the possible increase of the original band of so-called \"Israelites\" within the space of 430 years to such a number as is said to have quitted Egypt with Moses (Exodus 12:37). The \"household\" of Abraham comprised 318 adult males (Genesis 14:14). The \"households\" of Jacob, his eleven sons, and his numerous grown-up grandsons, have been with reason estimated at \"several thousands.\" (Kurtz, 'History of the Old Covenant,' vol. 2 p. 149, E. T.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTReuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2-5. - The sons of the legitimate wives Leah and Rachel are placed first, in the order of their seniority (Genesis 29:32-35; Genesis 30:18-20; Genesis 35:18); then these of the secondary wives, or concubines, also in the order of their birth (Genesis 30:6-13). The order is different from that observed in Genesis 46, and seems intended to do honour to legitimate, as opposed to secondary, wedlock. The omission of Joseph follows necessarily from the exact form of the opening phrase, \"These are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt with Jacob.\" Verse 5. - All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls. This is manifestly intended as a repetition of Genesis 46:27, and throws the reader back upon the details there adduced, which make up the exact number of \"seventy souls,\" by the inclusion of Jacob himself, of Joseph, and of Joseph's two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The inaccuracy by which Jacob is counted among his own descendants, is thoroughly Oriental and Hebraistic, however opposed to Western habits of thought. To stumble at it shows a narrow and carping spirit. (Compare note on Genesis 46:15.) For Joseph was in Egypt already. Joseph, i.e., has not been mentioned with the other sons of Jacob, since he did not \"come into Egypt with Jacob,\" but was there previously. The transfer of the clause to the commencement of the verse, which is made by the LXX., is unnecessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIssachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And Joseph died. Or, \"So Joseph died\" - a reference to Genesis 1:26 - and all his brethren. All the other actual sons of Jacob - some probably before him; some, as Levi (ch. 6:16), after him. Joseph's \"hundred and ten years\" did not constitute an extreme longevity. And all that generation. All the wives of Jacob's sons, their sister Dinah, and the full-grown members of their households who accompanied them into Egypt.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 1:7-14NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-14. - Here the real narrative of Exodus begins. The history of the Israelites from and after the death of Joseph is entered on. The first point touched is their rapid multiplication. The next their falling under the dominion of a new king. The third, his mode of action under the circumstances. It is remarkable that the narrative contains no notes of time. How long the increase continued before the new king arose, how long it went on before he noticed it, how long the attempt was made to cheek it by mere severity of labour, we are not told. Some considerable duration of time is implied, both for the multiplication (ver. 7) and for the oppression (ver. 11-14); but the narrator is so absorbed in the matters which he has to communicate that the question what time these matters occupied does not seem even to occur to him. And so it is with the sacred narrative frequently - perhaps we should say, generally. The chronological element is regarded as of slight importance; \"A thousand years in the Lord's sight are but as yesterday\" - \"one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\" Where a profane writer would have been to the last degree definite and particular, a sacred writer is constantly vague and indeterminate. We have in the Bible nothing like an exact continuous chronology. Certain general Chronological ideas may be obtained from the Bible; but in order to construct anything like a complete chronological scheme, frequent reference has to be made to profane writers and monuments, and such a scheme must be mainly dependent on these references. Archbishop Ussher's dates, inserted into the margin of so many of our Bibles, are the private speculations of an individual on the subject of mundane chronology, and must not be regarded as in any way authoritative. Their primary basis is profane history; and, though taking into consideration all the Scriptural numbers, they do not consistently follow any single rule with respect to them. Sometimes the authority of the Septuagint, sometimes that of the Hebrew text, is preferred; and the result arrived at is in a high degree uncertain and arbitrary. Verse 7. - The multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt from \"seventy souls\" to \"six hundred thousand that were men\" (Genesis 12:37) - a number which may fairly be said to imply a total of at least two millions - has been declared to be \"impossible,\" and to stamp the whole narrative of Exodus with the character of unreality and romance. Manifestly, the soundness of this criticism depends entirely on two things - first, the length of time- during which the stay in Egypt continued; and secondly, the sense in which the original number of the children of Israel in Egypt is said to have been \"seventy souls.\" Now, as to the first point, there are two theories - one, basing itself on the Septuagint version of Exodus 12:40, would make the duration of the Egyptian sojourn 215 years only; the other, following the clear and repeated statement of the Hebrew text (Exodus 12:40, 41), literally rendered in our version, would extend the time to 430 years, or exactly double it. Much may be said on both sides of this question, and the best critics are divided with respect to it. The longer period is supported' by Kalisch, Kurtz, Knobel, Winer, Ewald, Delitzsch, and Canon Cook among moderns; by Koppe, Frank, Beer, Rosenmuller, Hofmann, Tiele, Reinke, Jahn, Vater, and J. D. Michaelis among earlier critics; the short period is approved by Calvin, Grotius, Buddeus, Morinus, Voss, Houbigant, Baumgarten; and among our own countrymen, by Ussher, Marsham, Geddes, and Kennicott. The point cannot be properly argued in an \"exposition\" like the present; but it may be remarked that both reason and authority are in favour of the simple acceptance of the words of the Hebrew text, which assign 430 years as the interval between Jacob's descent into Egypt and the deliverance under Moses. With respect to the number of those who accompanied Jacob into Egypt, and were assigned the land of Goshen for a habitation (Genesis 47:6), it is important to bear in mind, first of all, that the \"seventy souls\" enumerated in Genesis 46:8-27 comprised only two females, and that \"Jacob's sons' wives\" are expressly mentioned as not included among them (ib. ver. 26). If we add the wives of 67 males, we shall have, for the actual family of Jacob, 137 persons. Further, it is to be borne in mind that each Israelite family which went down into Egypt was accompanied by its \"household\" (Exodus 1:1), consisting of at least some scores of dependants. If each son of Jacob had even 50 such retainers, and if Jacob himself had a household like that of Abraham (Genesis 14:14), the entire number which \"went down into Egypt\" would have amounted to at least 2000 persons. According to Malthus, population tends to double itself, if there be no artificial check restraining it, every twenty-five years. At this rate, 2000 persons would expand into 2,048,000 in 250 years, 1000 would reach the same amount in 275 years, and 500 in 300 years; so that, even supposing the \"seventy souls\" with their \"households\" to have numbered no more than 500 persons when they went down into Egypt, the people would, unless artificially checked, have exceeded two millions at the expiration of three centuries - that is to say, 130 years before the Exodus! No doubt, the artificial checks which keep down the natural tendency of population to increase began to tell upon them considerably before that time. The \"land of Goshen.\"a broad tract of very fertile country, became tolerably thickly peopled, and the rate of increase gradually subsided. Still, as the Delta was a space of from 7000 to 8000 square miles, and the land of Goshen was probably about half of it, a population of two millions is very much what we should expect, being at the rate of from 500 to 600 persons to the square mile. It is an interesting question whether the Egyptian remains do, or do not, contain any mention of the Hebrew sojourn; and if they do, whether any light is thereby thrown on these numbers. Now it is admitted on all hands that, about the time of the Hebrew sojourn, there was in Egypt a subject race, often employed in forced labours, called Aperu or Aperiu, and it seems impossible to deny that this word is a very fair Egyptian equivalent for the Biblical עצרים, \"Hebrews.\" We are forced, therefore, either to suppose that there were in Egypt, at one and the same time, two subject races with names almost identical, or to admit the identification of the Aperu with the descendants of Jacob. The exact numbers of the Aperu are nowhere mentioned; but it is a calculation of Dr. Brugsch that under Rameses II., a little before the Exodus, the foreign races in Egypt, of whom the Aperu were beyond all doubt the chief, \"amounted certainly to a third, and probably still more,\" of the whole population ('History of Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 100, E.T.), which is usually reckoned at from 7,000,000 to 8,000,000, One-third of this number would be from 2,300,000 to 2,600,000. The writer of Exodus does not, however, as yet, make anything like a definite calculation. He is merely bent on having it understood that there had been a great multiplication, and that the \"family\" had grown into a \"nation.\" To emphasise his statement, he uses four nearly synonymous verbs (\"were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed-mighty\"), adding to the last a duplicated adverb, bim'od m'od, \"much, much.\" Clearly, an astonishing increase is intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - There arose up a new king. It is asked, Does this mean merely another king, or a completely different king, one of a new dynasty or a new family, not bound by precedent, but free to adopt and likely to adopt quite new principles of government? The latter seems the more probable supposition; but it is probable only, not certain. Assuming it to be what is really meant, we have to ask, What changes of dynasty fall within the probable period of the Israelite sojourn in Egypt, and to which of them is it most likely that allusion is here made? Some writers (as Kalisch) have supposed the Hyksos dynasty to be meant, and the \"new king\" to be Set, or Salatis, the first of the Hyksos rulers. But the date of Salatis appears to us too early. If Joseph was, as we suppose, the minister of Apophis, the last Hyksos king, two changes of dynasty only can come into consideration - that which took place about B.C. 1700 (or, according to some, B.C. 1600), when the Hyksos were expelled; and that which followed about three centuries later, when the eighteenth dynasty was superseded by the nineteenth. To us it seems that the former of these occasions, though in many respects suitable, isNEWLINENEWLINE(a) too near the going down into Egypt to allow time for the multiplication which evidently took place before this king arose (see ver. 7), andNEWLINENEWLINE(b) unsuitable from the circumstance that the first king of this dynasty was not a builder of new cities (see ver. 11), but only a repairer of temples. We therefore conclude that the \"new king\" was either Rameses I., the founder of the nineteenth dynasty, or Seti I., his son, who within little more than a year succeeded him. It is evident that this view receives much confirmation from the name of one of the cities built for the king by the Hebrews, which was Raamses, or Rameses, a name now appearing for the first time in the Egyptian dynastic lists. Who knew not Joseph. Who not only had no personal know]edge of Joseph, but was wholly ignorant of his history. At the distance of from two to three centuries the benefits conferred by Joseph upon Egypt, more especially as they were conferred under a foreign and hated dynasty, were forgotten.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9 - And he said unto his people, Behold, the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. Literally, \"great and strong in comparison with us.\" Actual numerical superiority is not, perhaps, meant; yet the expression is no doubt an exaggerated one, beyond the truth - the sort of exaggeration in which unprincipled persons indulge when they would justify themselves for taking an extreme and unusual course.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Come on. The \"Come then\" of Kalisch is better. Let us deal wisely. \"The children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.\" Severe grinding labour has often been used as a means of keeping down the aspirations of a people, if not of actually diminishing their numbers, and has been found to answer. Aristotle (Pol. 5:9) ascribes to this motive the building of the Pyramids and the great works of Polycrates of Samos, Pisistratus of Athens, and the Cypselidae of Corinth. The constructions of the last Tarquin are thought to have had the same object (Liv. 1:56; Niebuhr, 'Roman History,' vol. 1. p. 479). Lest, when there falleth out any war, they join also to our enemies. 'At the accession of the nineteenth dynasty, though there was peace, war threatened. While the Egyptians, under the later monarchs of the eighteenth dynasty, had been quarrelling among themselves, a great nation upon their borders \"had been growing up to an importance and power which began to endanger the Egyptian supremacy in Western Asia\" (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 2). Both Rameses I. and his son Seti had almost immediately after their accession to engage in a war, which was rather defensive the, offensive, with the Khita, or Hittites, who were the great power of Syria (ib. pp. 9, 15, 16). At the commencement of his reign, Seti may well have feared a renewed invasion like that of the Hyksos, which would no doubt have been greatly helped by a rising of the Israelites. And so get them up out of the land. Literally, \"And go up out of the land.\" The Pharaoh already fears that the Israelites will quit Egypt. As men of peaceful and industrious habits, and in some cases of considerable wealth (Joseph. 'Ant. Jud.' 2:9, § 1), they at once increased the strength of Egypt and the revenue of the monarch. Egypt was always ready to receive refugees, and loth to lose them. We find in a treaty made by Rameses II., the son of Seti, with the Hittites, a proviso that any Egyptian subjects who quit the country, and transfer themselves to the dominion of the Hittite king, shall be sent back to Egypt ('Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They did set over them taskmasters. Literally, \"lords of tribute,\" or \"lords of service.\" The term used, sarey massim, is the Egyptian official title for over-lookers of forced labour. It occurs in this sense on the monument representing brick-making, which has been supposed by some to be a picture of the Hebrews at work. (See Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. pt. 1. p. 253, and compare Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 376.) To afflict them with their burdens. Among the tasks set the labourers in the representation above alluded to are the carrying of huge lumps of clay and of water-jars on one shoulder, and also the conveyance of bricks from place to place by means of a yoke. They built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom and Raamses. By \"treasure-cities\" we are to understand \"store-cities,\" or \"cities of store,\" as the same word is translated in 1 Kings 9:19 and 2 Chronicles 8:4. Such cities contained depots of provisions and magazines of arms. They were generally to be found on all assailable frontiers in ancient as in modern times. (Compare 2 Chronicles 11:5, 12; 2 Chronicles 33:28, etc.) Of the cities here mentioned, which the Israelites are said to have \"built,\" or helped to build, Pithom is in all probability the Patumes of Herodotus (2:158), which was not far from Bubastis, now Tel-Basta. Its exact site is uncertain, but if identical with the Thou, or Thoum, of the ' Itinerary of An-tonine,' it must have lain north of the Canal of Necho, not south, where most maps place it. The word means \"abode of the sun,\" or rather \"of the setting sun,\" called by the Egyptians Tam, or Atum. Names formed on the model were very common under the nineteenth dynasty, Rameses II. having built a Pa-Ra, a Pa-Ammon, and a Pa-Phthah in Nubia (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. it. p. 90). Pa-Tum itself has not been found among the cities of this period (ib. p. 99), but appears in the records of the twentieth dynasty as a place where the Setting-Sun god had a treasury ('Records of the Past,' vol. 6. p. 54). The name Rameses is probably put for Pa-Rameses (as Thoum for Pa-Tum), a city frequently mentioned in the inscriptions of the nineteenth dynasty, and particularly favoured by Rameses II., whose city it was especially called ('Records of the Past,' vol. it. p. 77; vol. 6. p. 13), and by whom it was greatly enlarged, if not wholly built. We incline to believe that the building was commenced by Seti, who named the place, as he did his great temple, the Rameseum, after his father. The city was, according to Brugsch, a sort of suburb of Tanis ('History of Egypt,' vol. 2 p. 94). It was a magnificent place, and under Rameses II. and his son Menephthah was the ordinary residence of the court. Hence the miracles of Moses are said to have been wrought \"in the field of Zoan,\" i.e. the country about Tanis (Psalm 78:12, 43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.

The word grieved very insufficiently renders the Hebrew verb, which \"expresses a mixture of loathing and alarm\" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. pt. 1, p. 251).

The word translated rigour is a very rare one. It is derived from a root which means \"to break in pieces, to crush.\" The \"rigour\" would be shown especially in the free use of the stick by the taskmaster, and in the prolongation of the hours of work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter and in brick. While stone was the material chiefly employed by the Egyptians for their grand edifices, temples, palaces, treasuries, and the like, brick was also made use of to a large extent for inferior buildings, for tombs, dwelling-houses, walls of towns, forts, enclosures of temples, etc. There are examples of its employment in pyramids (Herod. 2:136; Vyse, 'Pyramids of Gizeh,' vol. 3. pp. 57-71); but only at a time long anterior to the nineteenth and even to the eighteenth dynasty. If the Pharaoh of the present passage was Seti I., the bricks made may have been destined in the main for that great wall which he commenced, but did not live to complete, between Pelusium and Heliopolis, which was to secure his eastern frontier (Birch, 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 125). All manner of labour in the field. The Israelitish colony was originally employed to a large extent in tending the royal flocks and herds (Genesis 47:6). At a later date many of them were engaged in agricultural operations (Deuteronomy 11:10). These, in Egypt, are in some respects light, e.g. preparing the land and ploughing, whence the remark of Herodotus (2:14); but in other respects exceedingly heavy. There is no country where care and labour are so constantly needed during the whole of the year. The inundation necessitates extreme watchfulness, to save cattle, to prevent the houses and the farmyards from being inundated, and the embankments from being washed away. The cultivation is continuous throughout the whole of the year; and success depends upon a system of irrigation that requires constant labour and unremitting attention. If the \"labour in the field\" included, as Josephus supposed (1.s.c.), the cutting of canals, their lives would indeed have been \"made bitter.\" There is no such exhausting toil as that of working under the hot Egyptian sun, with the feet in water, in an open cutting, where there can be no shade, and scarcely a breath of air, from sunrise to sunset, as forced labourers are generally required in do. Me-hemet Ali lost 20,000 labourers out of 150,000 in the construction of the Alexandrian Canal towards the middle of the present century.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 1:15-22NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-22. - some time - say five or six years - having elapsed and the Pharaoh's first plan having manifestly failed, it was necessary for him either to give up his purpose, or to devise something else. Persevering and tenacious, he preferred the latter course. He bethought himself that a stop might be put to the multiplication of the Israelites by means of infanticide on a large scale. Infanticide was no doubt a crime in Egypt, as in most countries except Rome; but the royal command would legitimate almost any action, since the king was recognised as a god; and the wrongs of a foreign and subject race would not sensibly move the Egyptian people, or be likely to provoke remonstrance. On looking about for suitable instruments to carry out his design, it struck the monarch that something, at any rate, might be done by means of the midwives who attended the Hebrew women in their confinements. It has been supposed that the two mentioned, Shiphrah and Puah, might be the only midwives employed by the Israelites (Canon Cook and others), and no doubt in the East a small number suffice for a large population: but what impression could the monarch expect to make on a population of from one to two millions of souls by engaging the services of two persons only, who could not possibly attend more than about one in fifty of the births? The midwives mentioned must therefore be regarded as \"superintendents,\" chiefs of the guild or faculty, who were expected to give their orders to the rest. (So Kalisch, Knobel, Aben Ezra, etc.) It was no doubt well known that midwives were not always called in; but the king supposed that they were employed sufficiently often for the execution of his orders to produce an important result. And the narrative implies that he had not miscalculated. It was the disobedience of the midwives (ver. 17) that frustrated the king's intention, not any inherent weakness in his plan. The midwives, while professing the intention of carrying out the orders given them, in reality killed none of the infants; and, when taxed by the Pharaoh with disobedience, made an untrue excuse (ver. 19). Thus the king's second plan failed as completely as his first - \"the people\" still \"multiplied and waxed very mighty\" (ver. 20). Foiled a second time, the wicked king threw off all reserve and all attempt at concealment. If the midwives will not stain their hands with murder at his secret command, he will make the order a general and public one. \"All his people\" shall be commanded to put their hand to the business, and to assist in the massacre of the innocents - it shall he the duty of every loyal subject to cast into the waters of the Nile any Hebrew male child of whose birth he has cognisance. The object is a national one-to secure the public safety (see ver. 10): the whole nation may well be called upon to aid in carrying it out. Verse 15. - The Hebrew midwives. It is questioned whether the midwives were really Hebrew women, and not rather Egyptian women, whose special business it was to attend the Hebrew women in their labours. Kalisch translates, \"the women who served as midwives to the Hebrews,\" and assumes that they were Egyptians. (So also Canon Cook.) But the names are apparently Semitic, Shiphrah being \"elegant, beautiful,\" and Puah, \"one who cries out.\" And the most natural rendering of the Hebrew text is that of A. V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The stools. The explanation furnished by a remark of Mr. Lane ('Modem Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 142) is more satisfactory than any other. In modern Egypt, he says, \"two or three days before the expected time of delivery, the midwife conveys to the house the kursee elwiladeh, a chair of a peculiar form, upon which the patient is to be seated during the birth.\" A chair of the form intended is represented on the Egyptian monuments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The midwives feared God. The midwives had a sense of religion, feared God sufficiently to decline imbruing their hands in the innocent blood of a number of defenceless infants, and, rather than do so wicked a thing, risked being punished by the monarch. They were not, as appears by ver. 19, highly religious - not of the stuff whereof martyrs are made; they did not scruple at a falsehood, believing it necessary to save their lives; and it would seem that they succeeded in deceiving the king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They are vigorous. Literally, \"they are lively.\" In the East at the present day a large proportion of the women deliver themselves; and the services of professional accoucheurs are very rarely called in. The excuse of the midwives had thus a basis of fact to rest upon, and was only untrue because it was not the whole truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - Therefore God did well to the midwives. Literally, \"And God did well,\" etc. (see ver. 21). Because they feared him sufficiently to disobey the king, and take their chance of a punishment, which might have been very severe-even perhaps death - God overlooked their weak and unfaithful divergence from truth, and gave them a reward. He made them houses. He blessed them by giving them children of their own, who grew up, and gave them the comfort, support, and happiness which children were intended to give. There was a manifest fitness in rewarding those who had refused to bring misery and desolation into families by granting them domestic happiness themselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Every son that is born. The words are universal, and might seem to apply to the Egyptian, no less than the Hebrew, male children. But they are really limited by the context, which shows that there had never been any question as to taking the life of any Egyptian. With respect to the objection sometimes raised, that no Egyptian monarch would possibly have commanded such wholesale cold-blooded destruction of poor innocent harmless children, it is to be observed, first, that Egyptian monarchs had very little regard indeed for the lives of any persons who were not of their own nation. They constantly massacred prisoners taken in war - they put to death or enslaved persons cast upon their coasts (Diod. Sic. 1:67) - they cemented with the blood of their captives, as Lenormant says ('Manuel d'Hist. Anc.,' vol. 1. p. 423), each stone of their edifices. The sacredness of human life was not a principle with them. Secondly, that tender and compassionate regard for children which seems to us Englishmen of the present day a universal instinct is in truth the fruit of Christianity, and was almost unknown in the ancient world. Children who were \"not wanted\" were constantly exposed to be devoured by wild beasts, or otherwise made away with (Dollinger, ' Jew and Gentile,' vol. it. p. 246); and such exposition was defended by philosophers (Plat. 'Pep.' 5. p. 460 c). In Syria and Carthage they were constantly offered to idols. At Rome, unless the father interposed to save it, every child was killed. It would probably not have cost an Egyptian Pharaoh a single pang to condemn to death a number of children, any more than a number of puppies. And the rule \"Salus publica suprema lex,\" which, if not formulated, still practically prevailed, would have been held to justify anything. The river. Though, in the Delta, where the scene is laid throughout the early part of Exodus, there were many branches of the Nile, yet we hear constantly of \"the river\" (Exodus 2:3, 5; Exodus 7:20, 21; Exodus 8:3, etc.), because one branch only, the Tanitic, was readily accessible. Tanks (Zoan) was situated on it.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God spake all these words, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-17. - THE DELIVERY OF THE MORAL LAW. Every necessary preparation had now been made. The priests, as well as the people, had \"sanctified themselves.\" A wholesome dread of \"breaking\" through the fence, and \"touching\" the mount, had spread itself among the people Moses had returned from the camp to the summit of the mount; and both he and the people were attent to hear the words of the \"covenant,\" which had been announced to them (Exodus 19:5). Then, amid the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the smoke, and the earthquake throbs which shook the ground, a voice like that of a man, distinctly articulate, pronounced the words of that \"moral law,\" which has been from that day to this the guide of life to thousands upon thousands, the only guide to some, a very valuable and helpful guide to all who have known of it. It is well said by Kalisch, that the delivery of the Decalogue on Sinai \"formed a decisive epoch in the history of the human race,\" and was even perhaps \"the greatest and most important event in haman history,\" up to the time of its occurrence. Considering the weakness, imperfection, and moral obliquity of man, it was to the last degree important that an authoritative code should be put forth, laying down with unmistakable clearness the chief heads of duty, and denouncing the chief classes of sins. It may be true that the educated moral sense of mankind in civilised communities is sufficient to teach them all, or nearly all, of what the Decalogue forbids and enjoins; but this is the effect produced upon the internal constitution of our nature by long centuries of moral training; and nothing like it existed in primitive times. Then the moral sense was much duller; men's perceptions of right and wrong were confused, uncertain, and not unfrequently perverted and depraved. Even in Egypt, where a priest class, established as the spiritual guides of the nation for a thousand years or more, had elaborated a moral system of considerable merit, such a code as that of the Decalogue would have been a marked improvement upon anything that they had worked out for themselves. And the authoritative sanction by the \"voice\" and the \"finger of God\" was an enormous advantage, being imperatively needed to satisfy doubt, and silence that perverse casuistry which is always ready to question the off-hand decisions of the moral consciousness, and to invent a more refined system, wherein \"bitter is put for sweet, and sweet for bitter.\" Altogether the Decalogue stands on a moral eminence, elevated above and beyond all other moral systems - Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, or Greek, unequalled for simplicity, for comprehensiveness, for solemnity. Its precepts were, according to the Jewish tradition, \"the pillars of the law and its roots.\" They formed to the nation to which they were given \"tons omnis, publici privatique juris.\" They constitute for all time a condensed summary of human duty which bears divinity upon its face, which is suited for every form of human society, and which, so long as the world endures, cannot become antiquated. The retention of the Decalogue as the best summary of the moral law by Christian communities is justified on these grounds, and itself furnishes emphatic testimony to the excellency of the compendium. Verse 1. - God spake all these words. It has been suggested that Moses derived the Decalogue from Egypt, by summarising the chief points of the Egyptian teaching as to the duty of man. But neither the second, nor the fourth, nor the tenth commandment came within the Egyptian ideas of moral duty; nor was any such compendious form as the Decalogue known in Egypt. Moreover, Egyptian morality was minute and complex, rather than grand and simple. Forty-two kinds of sin were denied by the departed soul before Osiris and his assessors. The noble utterances of Sinai are wholly unlike anything to be found in the entire range of Egyptian literature.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I am the Lord thy God. The ten precepts were prefaced by this distinct announcement of who it was that uttered them. God would have the Israelites clearly understand, that he himself gave them the commandments. It is only possible to reconcile the declarations of the New Testament, that the law was given by the ministration of angels (Acts 7:53; Galatians 3:19; Hebrews 2:2) with this and other plain statements, by regarding God the Son as the actual speaker. As sent by his father, he too was, in a certain sense, an angel (i.e., a messenger). Which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. God does not appeal to his authority as creator, but to his mercy and kindness as protector and deliverer. He would be obeyed by his people from a sentiment of love, not by fear. Out of the house of bondage. Compare Exodus 13:3, 14; and for the ground of the expression, see Exodus 1:14; Exodus 6:9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt have no other gods before me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou shalt have. The use of the second person singular is remarkable when a covenant was being made with the people (Exodus 19:5). The form indicated that each individual of the nation was addressed severally, and was required himself to obey the law, a mere general national obedience being insufficient. No one can fail to see how much the commands gain in force, through all time, by being thus addressed to the individual conscience. No other gods before me. \"Before me\" literally, \"before my face,\" is a Hebrew idiom, and equivalent to \"beside me,\" \"in addition to me.\" The commandment requires the worship of one God alone, Jehovah - the God who had in so ninny ways manifested himself to the Israelites, and implies that there is, in point of fact, no other God. A belief in the unity of God is said to lie at the root of the esoteric Egyptian religion; but Moses can scarcely have derived his belief from this source, since the Egyptian notions on the subject were tinged with pantheism and materialism, from which the religion of Moses is entirely free. Outwardly the Egyptian religion, like that of the nations of Western Asia generally, was a gross polytheism; and it is against polytheistic notions that the first commandment raises a protest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. As the first commandment asserts the unity of God, and is a protest against polytheism, so the second asserts his spirituality, and is a protest against idolatry and materialism. Verses 4 and 5 are to be taken together, the prohibition being intended, not to forbid the arts of sculpture and painting, or even to condemn the religious use of them, but to disallow the worship of God under material forms. When the later Jews condemned all representations of natural objects (Philo, De Orac. 29; Joseph. Ant. Jud. 8:7, § 5), they not only enslaved themselves to a literalism, which is alien from the spirit of both covenants, but departed from the practice of more primitive times - representations of such objects having had their place both in the tabernacle (Exodus 25:31-34; Exodus 28:33, 34) and in the first temple (1 Kings 6:18, 29, 32, etc.). Indeed, Moses himself, when he erected the \"brazen serpent\" (Numbers 21:9) made it clear that representations of natural objects were not disallowed by the law. To moderns in civilized countries it seems almost incredible that there should ever have been anywhere a real worship of images. But acquaintance with ancient history or even with the present condition of man in savage or backward countries, renders it apparent that there is a subtle fascination in such material forms, and that imperfectly developed minds will rest in them not as mere emblems of divinity, but as actually possessed of Divine powers The protest raised by the second commandment is still as necessary as ever, not only in the world, but in the very Christian Church itself, where there exists even at the present day a superstitious regard for images and pictures, which is not only irrational, but which absorbs the religious feelings that should have been directed to higher objects. Any graven image. Perhaps it would be better to translate \"any image,\" for the term used (pesel) is applied, not only to \"graven\" but also to \"molten images\" (Isaiah 40:19; Isaiah 44:10; Jeremiah 10:14; etc.), since these last were in almost every instance finished by the graving tool. Or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above - i.e., \"any likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air.\" Compare Deuteronomy 4:17. The water under the earth. See Genesis 1:6, 7. The triple division here and elsewhere made, is intended to embrace the whole material universe. Much of the Egyptian religion consisted in the worship of animals and their images.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them. Every outward sign of honour was shown to images in the ancient world. They were not regarded as emblems, but as actual embodiments of deity. There was a special rite in Greece (Theopoea) by means of which the gods were inducted into their statues, and made to take up their abodes in them. Seneca says of the Romans of his own day - \"They pray to these images of the gods, implore them on bended knee, sit or stand long days before them, throw them money, and sacrifice beasts to them, so treating them with deep respect, though they despise the man who made them\" (Ap. Lact. 2:2). I, the Lord thy God am a jealous God. God \"will not give his glory to another\" (Isaiah 42:8; Isaiah 48:11), will not suffer a rival near his throne. He is not \"jealous.\" as the Greeks thought (Herod. 7:10, § 5), of mere success, or greatness; but he is very jealous of his own honour, and will not have the respect and reverence, which is his due, bestowed on other beings or on inanimate objects. Compare with the present passage Exodus 34:14; Deuteronomy 4:24; Deuteronomy 5:9; Deuteronomy 6:15; Joshua 24:19; etc. Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children. Exception has been taken to the plain meaning of this passage by a multitude of writers, who dread the reproach of the sceptic, that the God of the Old Testament is a God careless of justice and bent upon revenge. But neither does society, nor does civil justice itself, regard the visiting of parents' sins upon their children as in all cases unjust. Society by its scorn punishes for their parents' transgressions the illegitimate, the children of criminals, the children - especially the daughters - of adulteresses. Civil justice condemns to forfeiture of their titles and their estates, the innocent children of those executed for treason. God again manifestly does by the laws which obtain in his moral universe, entail on children many consequences of their parents' ill-doing - as the diseases which arise from profligacy or intemperance, the poverty which is the result of idleness or extravagance, the ignorance and evil habits which are the fruit of a neglected education. It is this sort of visitation which is intended here. The children and grandchildren of idolaters would start in life under disadvantages. The vicious lives of their parents would have sown in them the seeds both of physical and moral evil. They would commonly be brought up in wrong courses, have their moral sense early perverted, and so suffer for their parents' faults. It would be difficult for them to rise out of their unhappy condition. Still, \"each would bear his own iniquity.\" Each would \"be judged by that he had, not by that he bad not.\" An all-wise God would, in the final award, make allowance for the disadvantages of birth and inherited disposition, and would assign to each that position to which his own conduct - his struggles, efforts, endeavours after right - entitled him. To say that the threat \"applies only to such children as follow the sins of their fathers\" Kalisch) is to empty the passage of all force. It applies to all; but the visitation intended consists in temporal disadvantages, not in the final award of happiness or misery.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Shewing mercy unto thousands. Or, \"to the thousandth generation.\" (Compare Deuteronomy 7:9.) In neither case are the numbers to be taken as exact and definite. The object of them is to contrast the long duration of the Divine love and favour towards the descendants of those who love him, with the comparatively short duration of his chastening wrath in the case of those who are his adversaries. And keep my commandments. Thus only is love shown. Compare John 14:15-21; 1 John 2:5; 2 John 1:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. It is disputed whether this is a right rendering. Shav in Hebrew means both \"vanity\" and ,'falsehood;\" so that the Third Commandment may forbid either \"vain-swearing\" or simply \"false-swearing. It is in favor of the latter interpretation, that our Lord seems to contrast his own prohibition of unnecessary oaths with the ancient prohibition of false oaths in the words - \"Ye have heard that it hath been said by\" (or \"to\") \"them of old time - Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shelf perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I say unto you - Swear not at all\" (Matthew 5:33-34). It is also in favour of the command being levelled against false-swearing, that perjury should naturally, as a great sin, have a special prohibition directed against it in the Decalogue, while vain-swearing, as a little sin, would scarcely seem entitled to such notice. Perjury has always been felt to be one of the greatest both of moral and of social offences. It implies an absolute want of any reverence at all for God; and it destroys civil society by rendering the administration of justice impossible. There has been a general horror of it among all civilised nations. The Egyptians punished perjury with death. The Greeks thought that a divine Nemesis pursued the perjured man, and brought destruction both upon himself and upon his offspring .(Herod. 6:86). The Romans regarded the perjurer as infamous, and the object of Divine vengeance in the other world (Cic. De Leg. 2:9). The threat contained in the words - \"The Lord will not hold him guiltless\" - may be taken as an argument on either side. If viewed as equivalent to \"the Lord will punish severely\" (Kalisch), it accords best with the view that perjury was intended; if taken literally, it would suit best a lesser sin, of which men ordinarily think little.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Remember the sabbath day. The institution of the sabbath dates, at any rate, from the giving of the manna (Exodus 16:23). Its primeval institution, which has been thought to be implied in Genesis 2:3, is uncertain. The word \"remember\" here may be simply a reference to what passed in the \"wilderness of Sin\" as related in Exodus 16:22-30. On the sabbath itself, both Jewish and Christian, see the comment upon that chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Six days shalt thou labour. This is not so much a command as a prohibition\" Thou shaft not labor more than six (consecutive) clays.\" In them thou shelf do all thy necessary work, so as to have the Sabbath free for the worship and service of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God. Rather - \"The seventh day shall be a sabbath to the Lord thy God;\" i.e., the seventh day shall be a day of holy rest dedicated to religion. All unnecessary labour shall be suspended and put aside - the law of rest and ease, so far as bodily toil is concerned, which was the law of man's existence before the fall, shall supersede for the time that law of heavy toil and continual unrest, which was laid on man as the penalty of his transgression (Genesis 3:17-19). Eden shall be, as it were, restored - man shall not \"go out to his toil and his labour\" - even the very beasts, pressed into man's service since the fall, shall rest. In it thou shalt not do any work. On the exceptions to this rule, which even Judaism, with its extreme formality and literalism, saw to be necessary, see Matthew 12:5, 11. Still in many respects, a superstitious adherence to the precept was maintained by religious Jews, who would not even defend themselves on the sabbath, if attacked by an enemy (1 Mac. 2:32-38; 2 Mac. 5:25, 26 2Mac. 6:11 2Mac. 15:1). Experience, however, taught them that the law had not been intended to extend so far, and after a time they determined, not to seek battle, but to accept if, and do their best, on the sabbath day (1 Mac. 2:41). Thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter. The rest is to extend to the whole family. Work is not to be merely devolved by the parents upon the children. Thy manservant, nor thy maid servant. It is to extend beyond the family proper, to the domestics of the household, who are to enjoy the respite from toil and to have the advantage of the religious refreshment, no less than their masters. Nor thy cattle. God's care for cattle is a remarkable feature of the Old Testament dispensation. God, at the time of the flood, \"remembered Noah and the cattle which were with him in the ark\" (Genesis 8:1). Soon after, his covenant, not to drown the earth any more, was established \"with the fowl, and with the cattle, and with every beast of the earth,\" no less than with man (Genesis 9:9-11). In the Psalms he de clares that \"the cattle upon a thousand hills\" are his (Psalm 50:10). In Jonah, we find that Nineveh was spared, in part because there was in it \"much cattle\" (Jonah 4:11). The precept, \"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn\" is characteristic of the Mosaic dispensation, and had no parallel in the written codes or in the actual customs of other ancient nations. Animal suffering was generally regarded as of small account in the ancient world; and the idea of protecting animals from ill usage was wholly unknown. On the contrary, as Dr. Dollinger well observes (Jew and Gentile, vol. 2. pp. 346-7): \"The law was specially careful about the welfare of animals; they were to be treated with compassion and kindness. Domestic animals were to be well fed, and to enjoy the rest of the sabbath. The Israelites were to help to lift up the ass which had fallen beneath its burden, and to bring back the beast that had gone astray (Exodus 23:5, 12; Deuteronomy 25:4)... The young was not to be taken from its mother before the seventh day... From these and similar ordinances - such, for instance, as about the least painful method of killing animals - it is plain that the law tried to subdue that coarse turn of mind and unfeeling cruelty, which are engendered by the maltreatment of animals.\" Nor the stranger that is within thy gates. The \"strangers within the gates\" of Israel are those foreigners who voluntarily sojourned with them in their camps or (afterwards) in their towns. A \"mixed multitude\" had gone up out of Egypt with them (Exodus 12:38), and accompanied them in their wilderness wanderings. The command that these too should rest, was at once a restriction upon their liberty, requiring them to conform to the habits of those among whom they dwelt, and an admission of them into participation in some portion of the privileges of Israel. The sacred rest of the sabbath prefigured the final peace and happiness of the blest in heaven; and they who were commanded to share in the first, were encouraged to hope that they might also participate in the second.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth. Two reasons are assigned for the sanctification of the seventh day in the Pentateuch: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The fact that the work of creation took six days, and that on the seventh God rested; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. The further fact, that God brought the Israelites out of Egypt, and gave them a time of rest after a time of labour and toil (Deuteronomy 5:15). It is not expressly said that the deliverance took place on the Sabbath, but such is the Jewish tradition on the subject. The reason here assigned must be regarded as the main reason, man's rest being purposely assimilated to God's rest, in order to show the resemblance between man's nature and God's (Genesis 1:27), and to point towards that eternal rest wherein man, united with God, will find his highest bliss and the true end of his being. \"There remaineth a rest for the people of God.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHonour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Honor thy father and thy mother. The obligation of filial respect, love, and reverence is so instinctively' felt by all, that the duty has naturally found a place in every moral code. In the maxims of Ptah-hotep, an Egyptian author who lived probably before Abraham, \"the duty of filial piety is strictly inculcated\" (Birch, Egypt from the Earliest Times, p. 49). Confucius, in China, based his moral system wholly upon the principle of parental authority; and in Rome it may be regarded as the main foundation of the political edifice. In the Decalogue, the position of this duty, at the head of our duties towards our neighbour, marks its importance; which is further shown by this being \"the first commandment with promise\" (Ephesians 6:2). It is curious that the long life here specially attached to the observance of this obligation, was also believed to accompany it by the Egyptians. \"The son,\" says Ptah-hotep, \"who accepts the words of his father, will grow old in consequence of so doing;\" and again - \"The obedient son will be happy by reason of his obedience; he will grow old; he will come to favour.\" Modern commentators generally assume that the promise was not personal, but national - the nation's days were to be \"long upon the land,\" if the citizens generally were obedient children. But this explanation cannot apply to Ephesians 6:1-3. And if obedience to parents is to be rewarded with long life under the new covenant, there can be no reason why it should not have been so rewarded under the old. The objection that good sons are not always long-lived is futile. God governs the universe by general, not by universal laws.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not kill.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou shalt not kill. Here again is a moral precept included in all codes, and placed by all in a prominent position. Our first duty towards our neighbour is to respect his life. When Cain slew Abel, he could scarcely have known what he was doing; yet a terrible punishment was awarded him for his transgression (Genesis 4:11-14). After the flood, the solemn declaration was made, which thenceforward became a universal law among mankind - \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man\" (Genesis 9:6). In the world that followed the flood, all races of men had the tradition that only blood could expiate blood. In the few places where there was an organised government, and a systematic administration of justice, the State acted on the principle, and punished the murderer capitally. Elsewhere, among tribes and races which had not vet coalesced into states, the law of blood-revenge obtained, and the inquisition for blood became a private affair. The next of kin was the recognised\" avenger,\" upon whom it devolved to hunt out the murderer and punish him. Here the sin is simply and emphatically denounced, the brevity of the precept increasing its force. The Israelites are told that to take life is a crime. God forbids it. As usual, no exceptions are made. Exceptions appear later on (Numbers 35:22-25; Deuteronomy 4:42; etc.); but the first thing is to establish the principle. Human life is sacred. Man is not to shed the blood of his fellow-man. If he does, of his hand will the life taken surely be required. The casuistic question whether suicide is forbidden under this precept, probably did not occur to the legislator or to the Hebrews of his time. Neither the Hebrews, nor the Egyptians, among whom they had so long lived, were addicted to suicide; and it is a general rule that laws are not made excepting against tolerably well-known crimes. It has been argued that angry thoughts and insulting words were forbidden by it on the strength of our Lord's comment in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:21, 22). But it seems to the present writer that in Matthew 5:21-47 our Lord is not so much explaining the Jewish law as amplifying it on his own authority - note the repetition of the phrase, \"But I say unto you\" - and making it mean to Christians what it had not meant to Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not commit adultery.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou shalt not commit adultery. Our second duty towards our neighbour is to respect the bond on which the family is based, and that conjugal honour which to the true man is dearer than life. Marriage, according to the original institution, made the husband and wife \"one flesh\" (Genesis 2:24); and to break in upon this sacramental union was at once a crime and a profanity. Adulteresses and their paramours were in most ancient nations liable to be punished with death by the injured party; but the adultery of a married man with an unmarried woman was thought lightly cf. The precept of the Decalogue binds both man and woman equally. Our Lord's expansion of this commandment (Matthew 5:27-32) is parallel to his expansion of the preceding one (ib, 21-26). He shows that there are adulterous marriages in countries where the law gives a facility of divorce, and that without any overt act adultery may be committed in the heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not steal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou shalt not steal. By these words the right of property received formal acknowledgment, and a protest was made by anticipation against the maxim of modern socialists - \"La propriete, c'est le vol.\" Instinctively man feels that some things become his, especially by toil expended on them, and that, by parity of reasoning, some things become his neighbour's. Our third duty towards our neighbour is to respect his rights in these. Society, in every community that has hitherto existed, has recognised private pro-petty; and social order may be said to be built upon it. Government exists mainly for the security of men's lives and properties; and anarchy would supervene if either could be with impunity attacked. Theft has always been punished in every state; and even the Spartan youth was not acquitted of blame unless he could plead that the State had stopped his supplies of food, and bid him forage for himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. False witness is of two kinds, public and private. We may either seek to damage our neighbour by giving false evidence against him in a court of justice, or simply calumniate him to others in our social intercourse with them. The form of the expression here used points especially to false witness of the former kind, but does not exclude the latter, which is expressly forbidden in Exodus 23:1. The wrong done to a man by false evidence in a court may be a wrong of the very extremest kind - may be actual murder (1 Kings 21:13) More often, however, it results in an injury to his property or his character. As fatal to the administration of justice, false witness in courts has been severely visited by penalties in all well-regulated states. At Athens the false witness was liable to a heavy fine, and if thrice convicted lost all his civil rights. At Rome, by a law of the Twelve Tables, he was hurled headlong from the Tarpeian rock. In Egypt, false witness was punished by amputation of the nose and ears (Records of the Past, vol. 8. p. 65). Private calumny may sometimes involve as serious consequences to individuals as false witness in a court. It may ruin a man; it may madden him; it may drive him to suicide. But it does not disorganise the whole framework of society, like perjured evidence before a tribunal; and states generally are content to leave the injured party to the remedy of an action-at-law. The Mosaic legislation was probably the first wherein it was positively forbidden to circulate reports to the prejudice of another, and where consequently this was a criminal offence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou shalt not covet. Here the Mosaic law takes a step enormously in advance of any other ancient code. Most codes stopped short at the deed; a few went on to words; not one attempted to control thoughts. \"Thou shalt not covet\" teaches men that there is One who sees the heart; to whose eyes \"all things are naked and open;\" and who cares far less for the outward act than the inward thought or motive from which the act proceeds. \"Thou shalt not covet: lays it down again that we are not mere slaves of our natural desires and passions, but have a controlling power implanted within us, by means of which we can keep down passion, check desire, resist impulse. Man is lord of himself, capable, by the exercise of his free-will, of moulding his feelings, weakening or intensifying his passions, shaping his character. God, who \"requires truth in the inward parts,\" looks that we should in all cases go to the root of the matter, and not be content with restraining ourselves from evil acts and evil words, but eradicate the evil feeling from which the acts and words proceed. Thy neighbours house, etc. The \"house\" is mentioned first as being of primary necessity, and as in some sort containing all the rest. A man does not take a wife until he has a home to bring her to, or engage domestic servants, or buy slaves, except to form part of a household. The other objects mentioned are placed in the order in which they are usually valued. The multiplication of objects is by way of emphasis.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 20:18-21NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-21. - WITHDRAWAL OF THE PEOPLE, AND NEARER APPROACH OF MOSES TO GOD. The effect produced upon the people by the accumulated terrors of Sinai - \"the thunderings and the lightnings, the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking\" - the cloud, and the voice out of the cloud - was an awful and terrible fear. They could not bear the manifestation of the near presence of God; and therefore \"they removed and stood afar off.\" It seemed to them as if, on hearing the voice of God, speaking out of the thick darkness, they must die (ver. 19). Moses, upon their expressing these feelings, comforted them with an assurance that God had shown his terrors, not for their injury, but to put his fear in their hearts (ver. 20), and allowed them to retire to a distance from the mount, while he himself \"drew near unto the thick darkness where God was\" (ver. 21). Verse 18. - The people saw the thunderings. The use of a specific verb for a generic one, with terms to all of which it is not, strictly speaking, applicable, is common to many writers, and is known to grammarians as zengma. \"Saw\" here means \"perceived, witnessed.\" The mountain smoking. Compare Exodus 19:18. In Deuteronomy 5:23 it is said that \"the mountain did burn with fire.\" When the people saw it, they removed. It appears, from Deuteronomy 5:23, that. before retiring, the people sent a deputation of heads of tribes and elders up to Moses in the mount, to convey to him their wishes, and suggest that he should be their intermediary with God. Moses laid their wishes before God, and was directed to give them his sanction, whereupon they withdrew to their tents (ib, 30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And they said unto Moses. Their whole speech, as delivered in Deuteronomy, was as follows: - \"Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day, that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. Now, therefore, why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall die. For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God, speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? Go then near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and. we will hear it, and do it\" (Deuteronomy 5:24-27). The speech is here abbreviated greatly; but its essential points are preserved - \"Speak thou with us\" - be thou our intermediary - \"Let not God speak with us, lest we die.'\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And Moses said unto the people. Not immediately - Moses first held colloquy with God. God declared that the people had \"spoken well\" (Deuteronomy 5:28); and authorised Moses to allow of their withdrawal (ib, 30). Fear not. Here Exodus is more full in its details than Deuteronomy. Moses, finding the people in a state of extreme alarm, pacified them - assured them that there was no cause for immediate fear - God had not now come in vengeance - the object of the terrors of Sinai was to \"prove\" them - i.e., to test them, whether they were inclined to submit themselves to God, or not - and to impress upon their minds permanently an awful fear of God, that they might he kept back from sin by dread of his almighty power. The motive of fear is, no doubt, a low one; but where we can appeal to nothing else, we must appeal to it. Israel was still a child, only fit for childish discipline; and had to be directed by the harsh voice of fear, until it had learnt to he guided by the tender accents of love.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The people stood afar off. They retired from the base of Sinai to their tents, where they \"stood,\" probably in their tent doors. And Moses drew near unto the thick darkness. As the people drew back, Moses drew near. The display which drove them off, attracted him. He did not even fear the \"thick darkness\" - a thing front which human nature commonly shrinks. Where God was, he would be.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 20:22-26NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-26. - THE BOOK OF THE COVENANT, (chap. 20. ver. 22, to chap. 22. ver. 23). The Decalogue is followed by a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, which occupy the remainder of ch. 20. and the whole of the three following chapters (ch. 21, 22. and 23.). It appears from ch. 24. that these laws, received by Moses on Sinai, immediately after the delivery of the ten commandments, were at once committed to writing and collected into a book, which was known as \"the Book of the Covenant\" (Exodus 24:7), and was regarded as a specially sacred volume. The document, as it has come down to us, \"cannot be regarded as a strictly systematic whole\" (Canon Cook): yet still, it is not wholly unsystematic,but aims in some degree at an orderly arrangement. First and foremost are placed the laws which concern the worship of God, which are two in number: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Against idols;NEWLINENEWLINE2. Concerning altars (Exodus 20:23-26).NEWLINENEWLINEThen follow the laws respecting what our legal writers call \"the rights of persons\" - which occupy thirty-two verses of ch. 21. and fall under some twenty different heads, beginning with the rights of slaves, and terminating with the compensation to be made for injuries to the person caused by cattle. The third section is upon \"the rights of property,\" and extends from Exodus 21:33, to Exodus 22:15, including some ten or twelve enactments. After this we can only say that the laws are mixed, some being concerned with Divine things (as ch. 22:20, 29, 30; and ch. 23. 10-19): others with human, and these last being of various kinds, all, however, more or less \"connected with the civil organization of the state\" (Kalisch). In the fourth section the enactments seem to fall under about twenty-five heads. The result is that the \"Book of the Covenant\" contains, in little more than three chapters, about seventy distinct laws. Verse 22. - Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. The book opened with this reminder, which at once recalled its author and declared its authority. \"I, who give these laws, am the same who spake the ten commandments amid the thunders of Sinai. Reverence the laws accordingly.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, etc. This is a repetition, in part, of the second commandment, and can only be accounted for by the prohibition being specially needed. The first idea of the Israelites, when they considered that Moses had deserted them, was to make a golden calf for a god.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAn altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - An altar of earth. Among the nations of antiquity altars were indispensable to Divine worship, which everywhere included sacrifice. They were often provided on the spur of the occasion, and were then \"constructed of earth, sods, or stones, collected upon the spot.\" The patriarchal altars bad probably been of this character, and it was now provided that the same usage should continue: at any rate, elaborate structures of hewn and highly ornamented stone should not be allowed, lest thus idolatry should creep in, the images engraved upon the altars becoming the objects of worship. Thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings. The mode in which these are introduced implies that sacrifice was already a long-standing practice. The patriarchal sacrifices are well known (Genesis 8:20; Genesis 12:7; Genesis 22:9; Genesis 35:1). Jethro had recently offered sacrifice in the camp of Israel (Exodus 18:12). If the Israelites had not sacrificed to God during the sojourn in Egypt, at any rate they had kept up the idea of sacrifice; and it was for the purpose of offering sacrifices that Moses had demanded permission to go with all his nation into the wilderness. I will come unto thee and I will bless thee. The promise is conditional on the observance of the command. If the altars are rightly constructed, and proper victims offered, then, in all places where he allows the erection of an altar, God will accept the sacrifices offered upon it and bless the worshippers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone - i.e., if, notwithstanding my preference expressed for an altar of earth, thou wilt insist on making me one of stone, as more permanent, and so more honourable, then I require that the stones shall be rough stones shaped by nature, not stones chiselled into shape by the art of man. For if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it. It is conjectured with reason that we have here an old traditional idea, which God thought fit under the existing circumstances to sanction. The real object was that altars should not be elaborately carved with objects that might superinduce idolatry. The widely prevalent notion, that nature is sacred, and that all man's interference with nature is a defilement, was made use of economically, to produce the desired result. No tool being allowed to be used, no forms of living creatures could be engraved, and so no idolatry of them could grow up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar. Here the reason of decency, added in the text, is obvious; and the law would necessarily continue until sacerdotal vestments of a very different character from the clothes commonly worn by Orientals were introduced (38:3-43). After their introduction, the reason for the law, and with it the law itself, would drop The supposed \"slope of earth\" by which the priests are thought to have ascended to the \"ledge\" on the altar of burnt offerings, and the \"inclined plane,\" said by Josephus to have given access to the great altar of Solomon, rest on no sufficient authority, and are probably pure fictions. As soon as an ascent was needed, owing to the height of the altar, it was probably an ascent by steps (See Ezekiel 43:17.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - These are the judgments. The term \"judgment\" applies most properly to the decisions of courts and the laws founded upon them. No doubt the laws contained in the \"Book of the Covenant\" were to a large extent old laws, which had been often acted on; but we should do wrong to suppose that there was nothing new in the legislation. The Hebrew mishphat is used with some vagueness. Vers 2-11. -NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. ? If thou buy an Hebrew servant. Slavery, it is clear, was an existing institution. The law of Moses did not make it, but found it, and by not forbidding, allowed it. The Divine legislator was content under the circumstances to introduce mitigations and alleviations into the slave condition. Hebrews commonly became slaves through poverty (Leviticus 25:35, 39), but sometimes through crime (Exodus 22:3). In the seventh he shall go out. Not in the Sabbatical year, but at the commencement of the seventh year after he became a slave. If the jubilee year happened to occur, he might be released sooner (Leviticus 25:40); but in any case his servitude must end when the sixth year of it was completed. This was an enormous boon, and had nothing, so far as is known, correspondent to it in the legislation of any other country. Nor was this all. When he went out free, his late master was bound to furnish him with provisions out of his flock, and out of his threshing floor, and out of his winepress (Deuteronomy 15:12-14), so that he might have something wherewith to begin the world afresh. The humane spirit of the legislation is strikingly marked in its very first enactment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If he came in by himself, etc.. The first clause of this verse is further explained in the next; the second secured to the wife who went into slavery with her husband a participation in his privilege of release at the end of the sixth year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If his master have given him a wife. If the slave was unmarried when he went into servitude, or if his wife died, and his master then gave him a wife from among his female slaves, the master was not to lose his property in his female slave by reason of having permitted the marriage. When the man claimed his freedom at the end of the sixth year, he was to \"go out\" alone. Should children have been born, they were also to be the property of the master and to remain members of his household. No doubt these provisos, which cannot be regarded as unjust, had the effect of inducing many Hebrew slaves not to claim their release (vers. 5, 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - I love my master, etc. Affection might grow up between the slave and the master, if he were well treated. The Hebrew form of slavery was altogether of a mild kind. Masters are admonished to treat their slaves \"not as bond-servants, but as hired servants or sojourners,\" and again \"not to rule over them with rigour\" (Leviticus 25:39, 40, 43). Even among the heathen, slaves often bore a true affection to their masters. Or, the slave might be so attached to his wife and children as to be unwilling to separate from them, and might prefer slavery with the solace of their society to freedom without it. For such cases the provision was made, which is contained in ver. 6. On the slave declaring to his master his unwillingness to go free, the master might take him before the judges, or magistrates (literally \"gods\") as witnesses, and perhaps registrars of the man' s declaration, and might then reconduct him to his house, and by a significant ceremony mark him as his slave \"for ever.\" The ceremony consisted in boring through one of his ears with an awl, and driving the awl into the door or doorpost of the house, thereby attaching him physically to the dwelling of which he became thenceforth a permanent inmate. Almost all commentators assert that some such custom was common in the East in connection with slavery, and refer to Xen. Aaab. 3:1, § 31; Plant. Poenul. 5:2, 21; Juv. Sat. 1:104; Plutarch. Vit. Cic. § 26, etc. But these passages merely show that the Orientals generally - not slaves in particular - had their ears bored for the purpose of wearing earrings, and indicate no usage at all comparable to the Hebrew practice. The Hebrew custom - probably a very ancient one - seems to have had two objects -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The declaring by a significant act, that the man belonged to the house; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. The permanent marking of him as a slave, dis-entitled to the rights of freemen, he shall serve him for ever. Josephus (Ant. Jud. 4:8, § 20) and the Jewish commentators generally maintain that the law of the jubilee release overruled this enactment; but this must be regarded as very doubtful.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - If a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant. Among ancient nations the father' s rights over his children were generally regarded as including the right to sell them for slaves. In civilised nations the right was seldom exercised; but what restrained men was rather a sentiment of pride than any doubt of such sales being proper. Many barbarous nations, like the Thracians (Herod. 5:6), made a regular practice of selling their daughters. Even at Athens there was a time when sales of children had been common (Plut. Vit. Solon. § 13). Existing custom, it is clear, sanctioned such sales among the Hebrews, and what the law now did was to step in and mitigate the evil consequences. (Compare the comment on verse 2.) These were greatest in the case of females. Usually they were bought to be made the concubines, or secondary wives of their masters. If this intention were carried out, then they were to be entitled to their status and maintenance as wives during their lifetime, even though their husband took another (legitimate) wife (ver. 10). If the retention was not carried out, either the man was to marry her to one of his sons (ver. 9), or he was to sell his rights over her altogether with his obligations to another Hebrew; or he was to send her back at once intact to her father' s house, without making any claim on him to refund the purchase-money. These provisos may not have furnished a remedy against all the wrongs of a weak, and, no doubt, an oppressed class; but they were important mitigations of the existing usages, and protected the slave-concubine to a considerable extent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - If she please not her master.

Rather, \"Then let him cause her to be redeemed.\" Let him, i.e., look out for some one who will buy her of him and take his obligation of marriage off his hands To sell her to a strange nation he shall not have power. Only, this purchaser must be a Hebrew, like himself, and not a foreigner, since her father consented to her becoming a slave only on the condition of her being wedded to a Hebrew.

She shall go out free - i.e., she shall not be retained as a drudge, a mere maidservant, but shall return to her father at once, a free woman, capable of contracting another marriage; and without money - i.e., without the father being called upon to refund any portion of the stun for which he had sold her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - Homicide. Ver. 12 reiterates the Sixth Commandment, and adds to it a temporal penalty - \"he shall surely be put to death.\" The substance of this law had already been given to Noah in the words, \"Whoso sheddeth man' s blood, by man shall his blood be shed\" (Genesis 9:6). Real murder, with deliberate intent, was under no circumstances to be pardoned. The murderer was even to be torn from the altar, if he took refuge there, and relentlessly punished (ver. 14). See the case of Joab (1 Kings 2:28-34). But, if a man happened suddenly upon his enemy, without having sought the opportunity, and slew him (ver. 13), then the case was one not of murder, but at most of manslaughter, or possibly of justifiable homicide. No legal penalty was assigned to such offences. They were left to the rude justice of established custom, which required \"the avenger of blood\" to visit them with due retribution. According to the general practice of the Eastern nations, he might either insist on life for life or take a money compensation. With this custom, deeply ingrained into the minds of the Oriental people, the law did not meddle. It was content to interpose between the avenger of blood and his victim the chance of reaching an asylum. Places were appointed, whither the shedder of blood might flee, and where he might be safe until his cause was tried before the men of his own city (Numbers 35:22-25), and afterwards, if the judgment were in his favour. Some particular part of the camp was probably made an asylum in the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - God deliver him into his hand. This does not seem to mean more than, \"if he chance upon him without seeking him.\" God' s providence does in fact bring about the meetings which men call accidental. I will appoint thee a place. When we first hear of the actual appointment, the number of the places was six - three on either side of Jordan. (See Joshua 20:7, 8; and compare Numbers 35:10-15, and Deuteronomy 19:2.) Thus there was always a city of refuge at a reasonable distance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Presumptuously. Or \"proudly,\" \"arrogantly.\" Thou shalt take him from mine altar. See the comment on ver. 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - Other capital offences. The unsystematic character of the arrangement in this chapter is remarkably shown by this interruption of the consideration of different sorts of homicide, in order to introduce offences of quite a different character, and those not very closely allied to each other - e.g.,NEWLINENEWLINE1. Striking a parent;NEWLINENEWLINE2. Kidnapping;NEWLINENEWLINE3. Cursing a parent. Verse 15. - He that smiteth his father, etc. To \"smite\" here is simply to \"strike\" - to offer the indignity of a blow - not to kill, which had already been made capital (ver. 12), not in the case of parents only, but in every case. The severity of the law is very remarkable, and strongly emphasises the dignity and authority of parents. There is no parallel to it in any other known code, though of course the patria potestas of the Roman father gave him the power of punishing a son who had struck him, capitally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He that stealeth a man. Kidnapping, or stealing men to make them slaves, was a very early and very wide-spread crime. Joseph' s brothers must be regarded as having committed it (Genesis 37:28); and there are many traces of it in the remains of antiquity. (See Herod. 4:183; Strab. 7. p. 467; Sueton. Octav. § 32; etc.) Most kidnapping was of foreigners; and this was a practice of which the laws of states took no cognizance, though a certain disrepute may have attached to it. But the kidnapping of a fellow-country-man was generally punished with severity. At Athens it was a capital offence. At Rome it made a man infamous. We may gather from Deuteronomy 24:7, that the Mosaic law was especially levelled against this lena of the crime, though the words of the present passage are general, and forbid the crime altogether. Man-stealing, in the general sense, is now regarded as an offence by the chief civilised states of Europe and America, and is punished by confiscation of the stolen goods, and sometimes by imprisonment of the man-stealers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He that curseth his father, etc. Blasphemy against God, and imprecations upon parents, were the only two sins of the tongue which the law expressly required to be punished with death (Leviticus 24:16). In later times analogy was held to require that \"cursing the ruler of the people\" (Exodus 22:28) should be visited with the same penalty (2 Samuel 19:22; 1 Kings 2:8, 9, 46). The severity of the sentence indicates that in God' s sight such sins are of the deepest dye.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19 - Severe assault. Assault was punishable by the law in two ways. Ordinarily, the rule was that of strict retaliation' ' Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe\" (vers. 24, 25; compare Leviticus 24:20, and Deuteronomy 19:21). But where the assault was severe, causing a man to take to his bed, and call in the physician' s aid, something more was needed. The Rabbinical commentators tell us that in this case he was arrested, and sent to prison until it was ascertained whether the person hurt would die or no. If he died, the man was tried for murder; if he recovered, a fine was imposed. This was axed at such a sum as would at once compensate the injured man for his loss of time and defray the expense of his cure. A similar principle is adopted under our own law in many cases of civil action. Verse 18. - If men strive together. If there is a quarrel and a personal encounter. In our own law this would reduce this offence, if death ensued, to manslaughter. With a stone, or with his fist. The use of either would show absence of premeditation, and of any design to kill. A weapon would have to be prepared beforehand: a stone might be readily caught up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - If he rise again and walk upon his staff. If he recovered sufficiently to leave his bed, and get about with a stick to lean on, his hurt was not to be brought up against the injurer, though he died soon afterwards. Compensation was to be received, and the score regarded as wiped off.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - Homicide of slaves. In most ancient states the slave was the absolute property of his master, and might be ill-used to any extent, even killed, without the law in any way interfering. It is said that the state of things was different in Egypt (Kalisch); but we have scarcely sufficient evidence on the point to be certain that the slave enjoyed there any real and efficient protection. At Athens, beyond a doubt, the law protected the life of the slave; and a very moderate amount of ill-treatment entitled a slave to bring an action. At Rome, on the contrary, \"the master could treat the slave as he pleased, could sell him, punish him, and put him to death\" (Dict. of Greek & Roman Antiq. p. 1036). And this was the ordinary state of the law, particularly in Oriental countries. The Mosaic legislation must be regarded as having greatly ameliorated the condition of the native slave population. Hebrew bondmen it placed nearly upon a par with hired servants (Leviticus 25:40); foreign slaves, whether prisoners taken in war, or persons bought in the market, it protected to a very great extent. By the law given in verses 26, 27, it largely controlled the brutality of masters, who had to emancipate their slaves if they did them any serious injury. By the law laid down in verse 20, it gave their lives the same protection, or nearly the same, as the lives of freemen. \"Smiting \"was allowed as a discipline, without which slavery cannot exist; but such smiting as resulted in death was, as a general rule, punishable like any other homicide. The only exception was, if the slave did not die for some days (ver. 21). In that case the master was considered not to have intended the slave' s death, and to be sufficiently punished by the loss of his property. Verse 20. - If a man smite his servant, or his maid. \"Maids\" would commonly be chastised by their mistress, or by an upper servant acting under the mistress' s authority. \"A man\" here means \"any one.\" With a rod. The rods wherewith Egyptian slaves were chastised appear upon the monuments. They were long canes, like those used by our schoolmasters. Under his hand. Criminals in the East are said often to die under the bastinado; and even in our own country there have been cases of soldiers dying under the lash. A special delicacy of the nervous system will make a punishment of the kind fatal to some, which would have been easily borne by others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - If he continue a day or two - i.e., \"If the slave does not die till a day or two afterwards.\" Compare the provision in ver. 19, with respect to persons who were not slaves. No special callousness to the sufferings of slaves is implied. He is his money. The slave had been purchased for a stun of money, or was at any rate money' s worth; and the master would suffer a pecuniary loss by his death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22-25. - Assault producing miscarriage. Retaliation. Women in all countries are apt to interfere in the quarrels of men, and run the risk of suffering injuries which proceed from accident rather than design, one such injury being of a peculiar character, to which there is nothing correspondent among the injuries which may be done to man. This is abortion, or miscarriage. The Mosaic legislation sought to protect pregnant women from suffering this injury by providing, first, that if death resulted the offender should suffer death (ver. 23); and, secondly, that if there were no further ill-result than the miscarriage itself, still a fine should be paid, to be assessed by the husband of the injured woman with the consent of the judges (ver. 22). The mention of \"life for life,\" in ver. 23, is followed by an enunciation of the general \"law of retaliation,\" applied here (it would seem) to the special case in hand, but elsewhere (Leviticus 24:19, 20) extended so as to be a fundamental law, applicable to all cases of personal injury. Verse 22. - If men strive and hurt a woman. A chance hurt is clearly intended, not one done on purpose. So that her fruit depart from her. So that she be prematurely delivered of a dead child. And no mischief follow. \"Mischief\" here means \"death,\" as in Genesis 42:4, 38; Genesis 44:29. He shall pay as the judges determine. He was not to be wholly at the mercy of the injured father. If he thought the sum demanded was excessive, there was to be an appeal to a tribunal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Then thou shalt give life for life. \"Life for life\" seems an excessive penalty, where the injury was in a great measure accidental, and when there was certainly no design to take life. Probably the law was not now enacted for the first time, but was an old tribal institution, like the law of the \"avenger of blood.\" There are many things in the Mosaic institutions which Moses tolerated, like \"bills of divorce\" - on account of \"the hardness of their hearts.\" Verses 23, 24. - Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, etc. Aristotle says in the Nicomachean Ethics, that this was the rule of justice which Rhadamanthus was supposed to act on in the judgment after death (book 5, see. 3), and that it had the approval of the Pythagoreans. Solon admitted it to a certain extent into the laws of Athens, and at Rome it found its way. into the Twelve Tables. There is a prima facie appearance of exact equality in it, which would captivate rude minds and cause the principle to be widely adopted in a rude state of society. But in practice objections would soon be felt to it. There is no exact measure of the hardness of a blow, or the severity of a wound; and \"wound for wound, stripe for stripe,\" would open a door for very unequal inflictions \"Eye for eye\" would be flagrantly unjust in the case of a one-eyed man. Moreover, it is against public policy to augment unnecessarily the number of mutilated and maimed citizens, whose power to serve the state is lessened by their mutilation. Consequently in every society retaliation has at an early date given way to pecuniary compensation; and this was the case even among the Hebrews, as Kalisch has shown satisfactorily. If the literal sense was insisted on in our Lord' s day (Matthew 5:38), it was only by the Sadducees, who declined to give the law a spiritual interpretation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBurning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - Assaults on Slaves. The general law of retaliation was not made to extend to slaves. For ordinary blows the slave was not thought entitled to compensation, any more than the child. They were natural incidents of his condition. In extremer cases, where he was permanently injured in an organ or a member, he was, however, considered to have ground of complaint and to deserve a recompense. But for him to revenge himself upon his master by inflicting the same on him was not to be thought cf. It would have put the slave into a false position, have led to his prolonged ill-treatment, and have been an undue degradation of the master. Therefore, compulsory emancipation was made the penalty of all such aggravated assaults, even the slightest (ver. 27). Verses 26, 27. - If a man smite the eye, etc. The \"eye\" seems to be selected as the most precious of our organs, the \"tooth\" as that the loss of which is of least consequence. The principle was that any permanent loss of any part of his frame entitled the slave to his liberty. A very considerable check must have been put on the brutality of masters by this enactment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28-32. - Injuries done by cattle to slaves and freemen. For the purpose of inculcating as strongly as possible the principle of the sanctity of human life, the legislator notices the case where mortal injury is done to a person by a domesticated animal. The ox is taken as the example, being the animal most likely to inflict such an injury. In accordance with the declaration already made to Noah (Genesis 9:6), it is laid down that the destructive beast must be killed. Further, to mark the abhorrence in which murder ought to be held, the provision is made, that none of the creature' s flesh must be eaten. The question then arises, is the owner to suffer any punishment? This is answered in the way that natural equity points out - \"If he had reason to know the savage temper of the animal, he is to he held responsible; if otherwise, he is to go free.\" In the former case, the Hebrew law assigned a higher degree of responsibility than accords with modern notions; but practically the result was not very different. The neglectful Hebrew owner was held to have been guilty of a capital offence, but was allowed to \"redeem his life\" by a fine. His modern counterpart would be held to have been guilty simply of laches or neglect of duty, and would be punished by fine or imprisonment Verse 28. - The ox shall be surely stoned. He shall suffer the same death that would have been the portion of a human murderer. His flesh shall not be eaten. The animal was regarded as accursed, and therefore, as a matter of course, no Hebrew might eat of it. According to the Rabbinical commentators, it was not even lawful to sell the carcase to Gentiles. The owner shall be quit - i.e., \"shall be liable to no punishment.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - If the ox were wont to push with his horns. If he were notoriously, and to his owner' s knowledge, a dangerous animal, which required watching, and no watch was kept on him, then the owner became blame-able, and having by his neglect contributed to a homicide, was \"guilty of death.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - If there be a fine laid upon him. There can scarcely have been any circumstances under which the penalty of death would have been enforced. No neglect could bring the crime into the category of murder. It is assumed, therefore, that practically the penalty would be a fine, proportioned no doubt to the value of the life taken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Whether he have gored a son or a daughter.

Hitherto, the case of free persons only has been considered. But the accident might have happened to a slave. Where this was the case, the death of the ox was still made indispensable, and thus far the same sacredness was made to attach to the life of the slave and of the freeman. But, in lieu of a varying fine, the average price of a slave, thirty shekels of silver, was appointed to be paid in all cases, as a compensation to the masterNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 21:33-36NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - If a man shall open a pit. Rather, \"If a man shall uncover a cistern.\" Cisterns, very necessary in Palestine, were usually closed by a flat-stone, or a number of planks. To obtain water from them, they had to be uncovered; but it was the duty of the man who uncovered them, to replace the covering when his wants were satisfied. Or dig a pit and not cover it. A man who was making a cistern might neglect to cover it while it was in course of construction, or even afterwards, if he thought his own cattle would take no hurt. But in the unfenced fields of Palestine it was always possible that a neighbour' s cattle might go astray and suffer injury through such a piece of negligence. An ox, or an ass, falling into a cistern, would be unable to extricate itself, and might be drowned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - The owner of the pit shall make it good - i.e., \"shall duly compensate the owner of the cattle for its loss.\" And the dead beast shall be his. Having paid the full price of the slain beast, the owner of the cistern was entitled to its carcase.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35, 36. - If one man s ox hurt another s, etc. The hurt might be purely accidental, and imply no neglect. In that ease the two parties were to divide the value of the living, and also of the dead ox - i.e., they were to share between them the loss caused by the accident equally. If, however, there was neglect, if the aggressive animal was known to be of a vicious disposition, then the man who had suffered the loss was to receive the full value of the slain animal, but to lose his share of the carcase. This explanation, which the words of the text not only admit, but invite, seems better than the Rabbinical one, \"that the dead ox should also be the property of the injured party.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus21:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOr if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Exod.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - If a man shall steal an ox. The principal property possessed by the Israelites in the wilderness was their cattle; whence this occurs to the legislator as the thing most likely to be stolen. It required more boldness in a thief to carry off an ox than a sheep or goat; and so the crime was visited with a heavier penalty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - If a thief be found breaking up. Rather, \"Breaking in\" - i.e., making forcible entry into a house. The ordinary mode of \"breaking in\" seems to have been by a breach in the wall. Hence the word here used, which is derived from khathar, \"to dig.\" There shall no blood be shed for him. Rather, \"the blood-feud shall not lie upon him\" - i.e., the avenger of blood shall not be entitled to proceed against his slayer. The principle here laid down has had the sanction of Solon, of the Roman law, and of the law of England. It rests upon the probability that those who break into a house by night bare a murderous intent, or at least have the design, if occasion arise, to commit murder.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - If the sun be risen upon him. If the entry is attempted after daybreak. In this case it is charitably assumed that the thief does not contemplate murder. There shall be blood shed for him. Or, \"the blood-feud shall hold good in his case\" - i.e., his slayer shall be liable to be put to death by the next of kin. For he should make full restitution. Rather, \"He shall make full restitution.\" The punishment of the housebreaker, who enters a house by day, shall be like that of other thieves - to restore double. If he have nothing. Rather, \"if he have not enough\" - i.e., if he cannot make the restitution required, then he shall be sold for his theft. It is somewhat fanciful to suppose, that this punishment aimed at enforcing labour on those who preferred stealing to working for their own living (Kalisch). Probably the idea was simply the compensation of the injured party, who no doubt received the proceeds of the man's sale.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - If the theft be certainly found in his hand. If he be caught in flagrante delicto, with the thing stolen in his possession, \"whether it be ox, or ass, or small cattle,\" he shall restore double. The law of theft in the Mosaic legislation is altogether of a mild character, as compared with the Roman, or even with the English law, until the present century. Double restitution was a sort of \"retaliation\" - it involved a man losing the exact amount which he had expected to gainNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 22:2-6NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - LAW OF TRESPASS. - Next to theft, and not much behind it, is the wanton damage of what belongs to another - as when a person injures his neighbour's crops, either by turning beasts into his field, or by causing a conflagration in it. To turn beasts in was the more determinedly malicious act, and therefore the damage done was to be compensated by making over to the injured party a like quantity of produce out of the best that a man was possessed of; whereas simple restitution, was sufficient when fire had spread accidentally from a man's own land to his neighbour's. We may conclude that if the trespass of the cattle were accidental, simple restitution sufficed; and if the fire were kindled of set purpose, the heavier rate of penalty was exacted. Verse 5. - If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten. - Rather \"to be eaten of,\" or \"to be browsed upon.\" And shall feed. - Rather, \"and it shall feed.\" Of the best, etc. - This means that, without reference to the quality of the crop damaged, the injurer should forfeit an equal amount of his own best produce.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - If fire break out. - It is usual in the East (as in England) to burn the weeds on a farm at certain seasons of the year. When this is done, there is always a danger, in the dry parched-up Eastern lands, of the fire spreading, and carotid watch has to be kept. If this watch were neglected, a neighbour's sheaves or standing corn might be seriously damaged or even destroyed. The law punished such carelessness, by requiring the man who had kindled the fire to make restitution.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 22:7-13NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-13. - LAW OF DEPOSITS. - Deposition of property in the hands of a friend, to keep and guard, was a marked feature in the life of primitive societies, where investments were difficult, and bankers unknown. Persons about to travel, especially merchants, were wont to make such a disposition of the greater part of their movable property, which required some one to guard it in their absence. Refusals to return such deposits were rare; since ancient morality regarded such refusal as a crime of deep dye (Herod. 7:86). Sometimes, however, they took place; and at Athens there was a special form of action which might be brought in such cases called παρακαταθήκης δίκη. The penalty, if a man were east in the suit, was simple restitution, which is less satisfactory than the Mosaic enactment - \"He shall pay double\" (ver. 9). Verse 7. - Stuff. - Literally \"vessels\" - but the word is used in a very wide sense, of almost any inanimate movables.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - If the thief be not found. - It is not clear what was to be done in this case. Kalisch supposes that it came under the law of the oath (ver. 10), and that if the man entrusted with the deposit swore that he had not embezzled it, he was let go free. But as stolen cattle were to be compensated for to the owner (ver. 12), it would seem to be more consistent that stolen money or chattels should also have been made good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For all manner of trespass. - It has been supposed that this refers to \"every case of theft;\" but Kalisch is probably right in restricting it to cases where a person was accused of having embezzled property committed to his care. He was in that case to appear before the judges (Exodus 18:23), together with his accuser, and to clear himself if he could. When he failed to do so, and was \"condemned,\" he was bound to restore double. Which another challenges to be his. - Rather, \"which a man challenges to be the very thing\" (that he deposited). The case is supposed of the depositor being able to point out that the person to whom he entrusted the deposit has it still in his keeping.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass or an ox, etc. - The deposit of cattle is unheard of in classical antiquity; but it might well be the usage of a pastoral race (Genesis 47:3). The parallelism of the verse with verse 6 indicates that a deposit of the same kind is intended. If it die, or be hurt, or driven away. - The deposited beast might \"die\" naturally; or \"he hurt\" by a wild beast or a fall; or be \"driven away \"by thieves, without anyone seeing what had happened. In that case, if the man to whom the animal was entrusted would swear that he was no party to its disappearance, the owner had to put up with the loss.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - If it be stolen. - If, however, the case was not an ambiguous one, but certainly known to he one of theft, restitution had to be made, since it was supposed that with proper care the theft might have been prevented.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - If it be torn in pieces. - If again there was evidence that the creature had been killed by a wild beast, this evidence had to be produced, before the owner or the judges, for the trustee to be exonerated from blame. A similar proviso is found in the laws of the Gentoos (Rosenmuller, Orient. vol. 1. p. 148).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 22:14, 15NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15 LAW OF BORROWING. - The act of borrowing is connected with that of depositing, since in both cases, the property of one man is committed to the hands of another; only, in the one case, it is at the instance and for the benefit of the man into whose hands the property passes; in the other case, it is at the instance and for the benefit of the other party. This difference causes a difference of obligation. The borrower, having borrowed solely for his own advantage, must take all the risks, and in any case return the thing borrowed, or its value, unless the owner was still, in some sort, in charge of his own property. Things hired are not, however, to be regarded as borrowed. If harm come to them, the owner must suffer the loss. Verse 14. And it be hurt or die. - The thing borrowed might be animate or inanimate; either might be \"hurt;\" the former might not only be hurt, but \"die.\" Whatever the damage, and whatever the cause, unless in the single rare case of the owner being in charge, the law required the borrower to make good the loss to the owner. This law must have acted as a considerable check upon borrowing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. If the owner thereof be with it. - By \"with it,\" we must understand, not merely present, but in charge of it, or at any rate so near it that he might have prevented the damage, had prevention been possible. If it be an hired thing. - If anything were paid for the use of the thing, then it was not borrowed, but hired; and the owner was considered to have counted in the risk of loss or damage in fixing the amount of the hire. He was entitled therefore to no compensation Our own law does not rule this absolutely, but takes into consideration the proportion of the sum paid for hire to the value of the thing hired, and the general tacit understanding.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 22:16-31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - If a man entice. Rather \"seduce.\" He shall surely endow her to be his wife. In the East a man commonly pays money, or money's worth, to the parents in order to obtain a wife. The seducer was to comply with this custom, and make over to the damsel's father the sum of fifty shekels of silver (Deuteronomy 22:29), for his sanction of the marriage. If the father consented, he was compelled to marry the girl, and he was forbidden to repudiate her afterwards (ibid.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - If her father utterly refuse, etc. There might be such a disparity between the parties, or such an ineligibility of the man for a son-in-law, that the father might refuse to reestablish his daughter's status by the alliance. In that case the offender was to pay such a sum as would form a handsome dowry for the injured female, and enable her to enter with proper dignity the house of whatever man might be selected for her husband.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not suffer a witch to live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Law against witchcraft. Witchcraft was professedly a league with powers in rebellion against God. How far it was delusion, how far imposture, how far a real conspiracy with the powers of evil, cannot now be known. Let the most rationalistic view be taken, and still there was in the practice an absolute renunciation of religion, and of the authority of Jehovah. Wizards (Leviticus 19:31) and witches were, therefore, under the Jewish theocracy, like idolaters and blasphemers, to be put to death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Law against unnatural crime. The abomination here mentioned is said to have prevailed in Egypt, and even to have formed part of the Egyptian religion (Herod. 2:46; Strab. 17. p. 802; Clem. A1. Cohort. ad Gentes, p. 9; etc.). Though regarded by the Greeks and Romans as disgusting and contemptible, it does not seem to have been made a crime by any of their legislators. It was, however, condemned by the Gentoo laws and by the laws of Menu (11:17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Law against sacrificing to false gods. Sacrifice was the chief act of worship; and to sacrifice to a false god was to renounce the true God. Under a theocracy this was rebellion, and rightly punished with temporal death. In ordinary states it would be no civil offence, and would be left to the final judgment of the Almighty. Utterly destroyed. Literally, \"devoted;\" but with the meaning of \"devoted to destruction.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Law against oppression of foreigners. It may be doubted whether such a law as this was ever made in any other country. Foreigners are generally looked upon as \"fair game,\" whom the natives of a country may ridicule and annoy at their pleasure. Native politeness gives them an exceptional position in France; but elsewhere it is the general rule to \"vex\" them. The Mosaic legislation protested strongly against this practice (Exodus 23:9; Leviticus 19:33), and even required the Israelites to \"love the stranger who dwelt with them as themselves\" (Leviticus 19:34). For ye were strangers. Compare Leviticus 19:34, and Deuteronomy 10:19. In Exodus 23:9 the addition is made - \"For ye know the heart of a stranger\" - ye know; i.e., the feelings which strangers have when they are vexed and oppressed - ye know this by your own sad experience, and should therefore have a tenderness for strangers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-24. - Law against oppressing widows and orphans. With the stranger are naturally placed the widow and orphan; like him, weak and defenceless; like him, special objects of God's care. The negative precept here given was followed up by numerous positive enactments in favour of the widow and the orphan, which much ameliorated their sad lot. (See Exodus 23:11; Leviticus 19:9, 10; Deuteronomy 14:29; Deuteronomy 16:11, 14; Deuteronomy 24:19-21; Deuteronomy 26:12, 13.) On the whole, these laws appear to have been fairly well observed by the Israelites; but there were times when, in spite of them, poor widows suffered much oppression. (See Psalm 94:6; Isaiah 1:23; Isaiah 10:2; Jeremiah 7:3-6; Jeremiah 22:3; Zechariah 7:10; Malachi 3:5; Matthew 23:14.) The prophets denounce this backsliding in the strongest terms. Verse 22. - Ye shall not afflict. The word translated \"afflict\" is of wide signification. including ill-usage of all kinds. \"Oppress,\" and even \"vex,\" are stronger terms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And they cry at all unto me Rather, \"Surely, if they cry unto me.\" Compare Genesis 31:42.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I will kill you with the sword. It was, in large measure, on account of the neglect of this precept, that the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and destruction of its inhabitants, was allowed to take place (Jeremiah 22:3-5). Your wives shall be widows, etc. A quasi-retaliation. They shall be exposed to the same sort of ill-usage as you have dealt out to other widows.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-27. - The law of lending money and borrowing. It is peculiar to the Jewish law to forbid the lending of money at interest by citizen to citizen. In the present passage, and in some others (Leviticus 25:35; Deuteronomy 15:7), it might seem that interest was only forbidden in the case of a loan to one who was poor; but the general execration of usury (Job 24:9; Proverbs 28:8; Ezekiel 18:13; Ezekiel 22:12), and the description of the righteous man as \"he that hath not given his money upon usury\" (Psalm 15:5; Ezekiel 18:8), seem rather to imply that the practice, so far as Israelites were concerned, was forbidden altogether. On the other hand, it was distinctly declared (Deuteronomy 23:20) that interest might be taken from strangers. There does not seem to have been any rate of interest which was regarded as excessive, and \"usurious,\" in the modern sense. In Scripture usury means simply interest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - If thou take at all thy neighbour's raiment to pledge. Lending upon pledge, the business of our modern pawnbrokers, was not forbidden by the Jewish law; only certain articles of primary necessity were forbidden to be taken, as the handmill for grinding flour, or either of its mill-stones (Deuteronomy 24:6). Borrowing upon pledge was practised largely in the time of Nehemiah, and led to very ill results. See Nehemiah ch. 5. Thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down. The reason is given in the next verse. As it could not have been worth while to take the pledge at all, if it was immediately to have been given back for good, we must suppose a practice of depositing the garment during the day, and being allowed to have it out at night.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Wherein shall he sleep? The outer garment worn by the ancient Hebrews was like that of the modern Bedouins - a sort of large woollen shawl or blanket, in which they enveloped the greater part of their persons. It serves the Bedouins, to the present time, as robe by day, and as coverlet by night. When he crieth unto me. Compare ver. 23. If the law is broken, and the man cry unto the Lord, he will hear, and avenge him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28.- Law against reviling God, or rulers. It has been proposed to render Elohim here eitherNEWLINENEWLINE1. \"God;\" orNEWLINENEWLINE2. \"The gods;\" orNEWLINENEWLINE3NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - Law concerning first-fruits. God required as first-fruits from his people,NEWLINENEWLINE1. The first-born of their children;NEWLINENEWLINE2. The firstborn of all their cattle; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. The first of all the produce of their lands,NEWLINENEWLINEwhether wet or dry; wine, oil, grain of all kinds, and fruits. The first-born of their children were to be redeemed by a money payment (Exodus 13:13; Numbers 3:46-48); but the rest was to be offered in sacrifice. The phrase, \"thou shalt not delay,\" implies that there would be reluctance to comply with this obligation, and that the offering would be continually put off. In Nehemiah's time the entire custom had at one period fallen into disuse. (Nehemiah 10:35, 36.) The first of thy ripe fruits. Literally, \"thy fulness.\" The paraphrase of the A. V. no doubt gives the true meaning. The first-born of thy sons, Compare above, Exodus 13:2, 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Seven days it shall be with its dam. See Leviticus 22:27. The main object is that the darn may have during that time the natural relief derivable from suckling its off-spring. On the eighth day thou shalt give it me. Some analogy may be traced between this proviso and the law of circumcision. Birth was viewed as an unclean process, and nothing was fit for presentation to God excepting after an interval.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus22:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And ye shall be holy men unto me. Ye shall not be as other men, but \"an holy nation, a peculiar people;\" and therefore your separateness shall be marked by all manner of laws and regulations with respect to meats and drinks, designed to keep you free from every uncleanness. One such law then follows - Law against eating the flesh of an animal killed by another. The blood of such an animal would not be properly drained from it. Some would remain in the tissues, and thence the antrum would be unclean; again, the carnivorous beast which \"tore\" it would also be unclean, and by contact would impart of its uncleanness to the other. Ye shall cast it to the dogs, is probably not intended to exclude the giving or selling of it to an Mien, if one were at hand, according to the permission accorded in Deuteronomy 14:21; but points simply to the mode whereby the flesh was to be got rid of, if aliens were not at hand, or if they declined to eat the animals. Dogs were so unclean that they might be fed on anything. Their chief use was to be scavengers (2 Kings 9:35, 36).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.23":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The ninth commandment is here expanded and developed. Thou shalt not raise a false report, forbids the origination of a calumny; the other clause prohibits the joining with others in spreading one. Both clauses have a special reference to bearing witness in a court, but neither would seem to be confined to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil. Rather, \"Thou shalt not follow a multitude to evil.\" A law alike for deed, for word, and for thought. The example of the many is to be shunned. \"Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat.\" But \"strait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it\" (Matthew 7:13, 14). It is extraordinary that so many, even of professing Christians, are content to go with the many, notwithstanding the warnings against so doing, both of the law and of the Gospel. Neither shalt thou speak, etc. Rather, \"Neither shalt thou bear witness in a cause to go aside after a multitude to put aside justice.\" The general precept is followed by a particular application of it. In judging a cause, if thou art one of the judges, thou shalt not simply go with the majority, if it he bent on injustice, but form thine own opinion and adhere to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause. After the many precepts in favour of the poor, this injunction produces a sort of shock. But it is to be understood as simply forbidding any undue favouring of the poor because they are poor, and so as equivalent to the precept in Leviticus 19:15, \"Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor.\" In courts of justice, strict justice is to be rendered, without any leaning either towards the rich, or towards the poor. To lean either way is to pervert judgment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thine enemy's ox. A private enemy is here spoken of, not a public one, as in Deuteronomy 23:6. It is remarkable that the law should have so far anticipated Christianity as to have laid it down that men have duties of friendliness even towards their enemies, and are bound under certain circumstances to render them a service. \"Hate thine enemies\" (Matthew 5:43) was no injunction of the Mosaic taw, but a conclusion which Rabbinical teachers unwarrantably drew from it. Christianity, however, goes far beyond Mosaism in laying down the broad precept - \"Love your enemies.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee, etc. The general meaning of the passage is clear - assistance is to be given to the fallen ass of an enemy - but the exact sense of both the second and third clauses is doubtful. Many renderings have been suggested; but it is not clear that any one of them is an improvement on the Authorised Version. Thou shalt surely help with him. The joint participation in an act of mercy towards a fallen beast would bring the enemies into friendly contact, and soften their feelings towards each other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - As in verse 3 men were warned not to favour the poor unduly in courts of justice out of compassion for them, so here there is a warning against the opposite, and far more usual error, of leaning against the poor man in our evidence or in our decisions The scales of justice are to be held even; strict right is to be done; our feelings are not be allowed to influence us, much less our class prejudices.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Keep thee far from a false matter. Hold aloof, i.e., from anything like a false accusation. Neither bring one, nor countenance one, else those mayest cause the death of an innocent and righteous man, and bring down on thyself the vengeance of him, who will not justify the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - And thou shalt take no gift. The worst sin of a judge, and the commonest in the East, is to accept abribe from one of the parties to a suit, and give sentence accordingly. As such a practice defeats the whole end for which the administration of justice exists, it is, when detected, for the most part, punished capitally. Josephus tells us that it was so among the Jews (Contr. Apion. 2:27); but the Mosaic code, as it has come down to us, omits to fix the penalty. Whatever it was, it was practically set at nought. Eli's sons \"turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment\" (1 Samuel 8:3). In David's time, men's hands were \"full of bribes\" (Psalm 26:10). Solomon complains of wicked men\" taking gifts out of their bosoms to pervert the ways of judgment\" (Proverbs 17:23). Isaiah is never weary of bearing witness against the princes of his day, who\" love gifts and follow after rewards\" (Isaiah 1:23);who \"justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him\" (Isaiah 5:23). Micah adds his testimony - \"Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment and pervert all equity. They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward\" (Exodus 3:9-11). The gift blindeth the wise. See Deuteronomy 16:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou shalt not oppress a stranger. This is a repetition of Exodus 22:21, with perhaps a special reference to oppression through courts of justice. For thou knowest the heart of a stranger. Literally, \"the mind of a stranger,\" or, in other words, his thoughts and feelings. Thou shouldest therefore be able to sympathise with him. CEREMONIAL LAWS (vers. 10-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10, 11. - Law of the Sabbatical year. Days of rest, at regular or irregular intervals, were well known to the ancients and some regulations of the kind existed in most countries But entire years of rest were wholly unknown to any nation except the Israelites. and exposed them to the reproach of idleness. (See Tacit. Hist. 5:4: - \"Septimo die otium placuisse ferunt, quia is finem laborum dedit; dein, blandiente inertia, septimum quoque annum ignaviae datum\"). In a primitive condition of agriculture, when rotation of crops was unknown, artificial manure unemployed, and the need of letting even the best land sometimes lie fallow unrecognised, it may not have been an uneconomical arrangement to require an entire suspension of cultivation once in seven years. But great difficulty was probably experienced in enforcing the law. Just as there were persons who wished to gather manna on the seventh day (Exodus 16:27), so there would be many anxious to obtain in the seventh year something more from their fields than Nature would give them if left to herself. If the \"seventy years\" of the captivity were intended exactly to make up for omissions of the due observance of the sabbatical year, we must suppose that between the time of the exodus and the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the ordinance had been as often neglected as observed. (See 2 Chronicles 36:21.) The primary object of the requirement was, as stated in ver. 11, that the poor of thy people may eat, what the land brought forth of its own accord in the Sabbatical year being shared by them (Leviticus 25:6.). But no doubt it was also intended that the Sabbatical year should be one of increased religious observance, whereof the solemn reading of the law in the ears of the people at the Feast of Tabernacles \"in the year of release\" (Deuteronomy 31:10) was an indication and a part. That reading was properly preceded by a time of religious preparation (Nehemiah 8:1-15), and would naturally lead on to further acts of a religious character, which might occupy a considerable period (ibid. chs. 9. and 10.). Altogether, the year was a most solemn period, calling men to religious self-examination, to repentance, to the formation of holy habits, and tending to a general elevation among the people of the standard of holiness. What they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. There was to be no regular ingathering. The proprietor, his servants, the poor, and the stranger were to take what they needed; and the residue was to be for the cattle and for the beasts that were in the land (Deuteronomy 25:6, 7). Thy vineyard - thy oliveyard. Corn, wine, and oil were the only important products of Palestine; and this mention of the vineyard and the oliveyard shows that one and the same law was to hold good of all the lands in the country, however they might be cultivated. The whole land was to rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Law of the Sabbath, repeated. Nothing is here added to the teaching of the Fourth Commandment; but its merciful character is especially brought out. Men are called on to observe it, in order that their cattle may obtain rest, and their servants, together with the stranger that is within their gates, may find refreshment. It is to be borne in mind that the foreign population of Palestine was mostly held to hard service. (See 2 Chronicles 2:17, 18.) Verse 13 contains two injunctions - one general, one special: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. \"Be circumspect\" (or cautious, careful) \"in respect of all that I command you.\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. \"Do not so much as utter the name of any false god.\" Not even to mention their names, was to show them the greatest contempt possible; and, if followed out universally, would soon have produced an absolute oblivion of them. Moses, it may be observed, scarcely ever does mention their names. Later historians and prophets had to do so, either to deliver the true history of the Israelites, or to denounce idolatries to which they were given. There are many words one would wish never to utter; but while wicked men do the things of which they are the names, preachers are obliged to use the words in their sermons and other warnings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThree times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-17. - Law of Festivals. \"The sanctification of days and times,\" says Richard Hooker, \"is a token of that thankfulness and a part of that public honour which we owe to God for admirable benefits, whereof it doth not suffice that we keep a secret calendar, taking thereby our private occasions as we list ourselves to think how much God hath done for all men; but the days which are chosen out to serve as public memorials of such his mercies ought to be clothed with those outward robes of holiness whereby their difference from other days may be made sensible\" (Eccles. Pol. 5:70, § 1). All ancient religions had solemn festival seasons, when particular mercies of God were specially commemorated, and when men, meeting together in large numbers, mutually cheered and excited each other to a warmer devotion and a more hearty pouring forth of thanks than human weakness made possible at other times. In Egypt such festivals were frequent, and held a high place in the religion (Herod. 2:58-64:). Abraham's family had probably had observances of the kind in their Mesopotamian home. God's providence saw good now to give supernatural sanction to the natural piety which had been accustomed thus to express itself. Three great feasts were appointed, of which the most remarkable features were -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That they were at once agricultural and historical - connected with the regularly recurrent course of the seasons, and connected also with great events in the life of the nation;NEWLINENEWLINE2. That they could be kept only at one spot, that namely where the tabernacle was at the time located;NEWLINENEWLINE3. That they were to be attended by the whole male population. The three festivals are here called -NEWLINENEWLINE1.

The Feast of Harvest (elsewhere called \"of weeks\") at the beginning of summer, when the wheat crop had been reaped, commemorative of the giving of the law; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. The Feast of Ingathering (ver 16) in Tisri, at the close of the vintage, when all the crops of every kind had been gathered in, commemorative of the sojourn in the wilderness. The first of the three, the feast of unleavened bread, had been already instituted (Exodus 13:3-10); the two others are now for the first time sketched out, their details being kept back to be fined in subsequently (Leviticus 23:15-21, and 34-36). Here the legislator is content to lay it down that the great feasts will be three, and that all the males are to attend them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The feast of unleavened bread. This commenced with the Passover, and continued for the seven days following, with a \"holy convocation\" on the first of the seven and on the last (Leviticus 23:5-8). Unleavened bread was eaten in commemoration of the hasty exodus from Egypt (Exodus 12:34). A sheaf of new barley - the first-fruits of the harvest - was offered as a wave-offering before the Lord (Leviticus 23:10-14). Every male Israelite of full age was bound to attend, and to bring with him a free-will offering. In the time appointed of the month - i.e., on the fourteenth day (Exodus 12:18). None shall appear before me empty. This rule applies, not to the Passover only, but to all the feasts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The feast of harvest. Fifty days were to be numbered from the day of offering the barley sheaf, and on the fiftieth the feast of harvest, thence called \"Pentecost,\" was to be celebrated. Different Jewish sects make different calculations; but the majority celebrate Pentecost on the sixth of Sivan (May 25). The main ceremony was the offering to God of two leavened loaves of the finest flour made out of the wheat just gathered in, and called the first-fruits of the harvest. The festival lasted only a single day; but it was one of a peculiarly social and joyful character (Deuteronomy 16:9-11). Jewish tradition connects the feast further with the giving of the law, which must certainly have taken place about the time (see Exodus 19:1-16). The firstfruits. Rather, \"Of the first-fruits.\" The word is in apposition with \"harvest,\" not with \"feast.\" Which thou hast sown. The sown harvest was gathered in by Pentecost; what remained to collect afterwards was the produce of plantations. The feast of ingathering. Called elsewhere, and more commonly, \"the feast of tabernacles\" (Leviticus 23:34; Deuteronomy 16:13; Deuteronomy 31:10; John 7:2), from the circumstance that the people were commanded to make themselves booths, and dwell in them during the time of the feast. The festival began on the 15th of Tisri, or in the early part of our October, when the olives had been gathered in and the vintage was completed. It lasted seven, or (according to some) eight days, and comprised two holy convocations. In one point of view it was a festival of thanksgiving for the final getting in of the crops; in another, a commemoration of the safe passage through the desert from Egypt to Palestine. The feast seems to have been neglected during the captivity, but was celebrated with much glee in the time of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 8:17). In the end of the year - i.e., the end of the agricultural year - when the harvest was over - as explained in the following clause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThree times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord God. This seems to moderns a very burthensome enactment. But we must remember that Palestine is not bigger than Wales, and that great gatherings had great attractions for many in the ancient world, when they were the only means by which information was spread, and almost the only occasions on which friends and relations who lived far apart could expect to see each other. The European Greeks had, in their Olympian and other games, similar great gatherings, which occurred once or twice in each year, and, though under no obligation to do so, attended them in enormous numbers. It may be doubted if the religious Hebrews felt the obligation of attendance to be a burthen. It was assuredly a matter of great importance, as tending to unity, and to the quickening of the national life, that they should be drawn so continually to one centre, and be so frequently united in one common worship. Most students of antiquity regard the Greek games as having exerted a strong unifying influence over the scattered members of the Grecian family. The Hebrew festivals, occurring so much more frequently, and required to be attended by all, must have had a similar, but much greater, effect of the same kind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Law of the Paschal sacrifice. That the Paschal lamb is here intended by \"my sacrifice,\" seems to be certain, since the two injunctions to put away leavened bread, and to allow none of the victim's flesh to remain till the morning (see Exodus 12:10), are combined in the Paschal sacrifice only. Of all the offerings commanded in the law the Paschal lamb was the most important, since it typified Christ. It may therefore well be termed, in an especial way, \"God's sacrifice.\" By the fat of my feast some understand the fat of the lamb, others the best part of the feast (Keil) - i.e., the lamb itself. In Exodus 34:25, which is closely parallel to the present place, we read, for \"the fat of my feast,\" \"the sacrifice of the feast of the passover.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Law of first-fruits. The first of the first-fruits may mean either \"the best of the first-fruits\" (see Numbers 18:12), or \"the very first of each kind that is ripe\" (ib, verse 13). On the tendency to delay, and not bring the very first, see the comment on Exodus 22:29. The house of the Lord. Generally, in the Pentateuch we have the periphrasis\" the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to put his name there\" (Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14; Deuteronomy 16:16; Deuteronomy 26:2, etc.); but here, and in Exodus 34:26, and again in Deuteronomy 23:18, this \"place\" is plainly declared to be a \"house\" or \"temple.\" Law against seething a kid in the mother's milk. The outline of law put before the Israelites in the \"Book of the Covenant\" terminated with this remarkable prohibition. Its importance is shown -NEWLINENEWLINE1. By its place here; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. By its being thrice repeated in the law of Moses (see Exodus 34:26; and Deuteronomy 14:21). Various explanations have been given of it; but none is saris-factory, except that which views it as \"a protest against cruelty, and outraging the order of nature,\" more especially that peculiarly sacred portion of nature's order, the tender relation between parent and child, mother and suckling. No doubt the practice existed. Kids were thought to be most palatable when boiled in milk; and the mother's milk was frequently the readiest to obtain. But in this way the mother was made a sort of accomplice in the death of her child, which men were induced to kill on account of the flavour that her milk gave it. Reason has nothing to say against such a mode of preparing food, but feeling revolts from it; and the general sense of civilised mankind reechoes the precept, which is capable of a wide application - Thou shalt not seethe a kind in his mother's milk.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 23:20-31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-31. - THE REWARDS OF OBEDIENCE. God always places before men\" the recompense of the reward.\" He does not require of them that they should serve him for nought. The \"Book of the Covenant\" appropriately ends with a number of promises, which God undertakes to perform, if Israel keeps the terms of the covenant. The promises are: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That he will send an angel before them to be their guide, director, and helper (vers. 20 - 23).NEWLINENEWLINE2. That he will be the enemy of their enemies (ver. 22), striking terror into them miraculously (ver. 27), and subjecting them to other scourges also (ver. 28).NEWLINENEWLINE3. That he will drive out their enemies \"by little and little\" (ver. 30), not ceasing until he has destroyed them (ver. 23).NEWLINENEWLINE4. That he will give them the entire country between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean on the one hand, the Desert and the Euphrates on the other (ver. 31). AndNEWLINENEWLINE5. That he will bless their sustenance, avert sickness from them, cause them to multiply, and prolong their days upon earth (vers. 25, 26). At the same time, all these promises - except the first - are made conditional. If they will \"beware\" of the angel and \"obey his voice,\" then he will drive their enemies out (vers. 22, 23): if they will serve Jehovah, and destroy the idols of the nations, then he will multiply them, and give them health and long life (vers. 24-26), and \"set their bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river\" (ver. 31). So far as they fall short of their duties, is he entitled to fall short of his promises. A reciprocity is established. Unless they keep their engagements, he is not bound to keep his. Though the negative side is not entered upon, this is sufficiently clear. None of the promises, except the promise to send the angel, is absolute. Their realisation depends on a strict and hearty obedience. Verse 20. - Behold, I send a messenger before thee. Jewish commentators regard the messenger as Moses, who, no doubt, was a specially commissioned ambassador for God, and who might, therefore, well be termed God's messenger. But the expressions - \"He will not pardon your transgressions,\" and \"My name is in him,\" are too high for Moses. An angel must be intended - probably \"the Angel of the Covenant,\" - whom the best expositors identify with the Second Person of the Trinity, the Ever-Blessed Son of God. To keep thee in the way is not simply \"to guide thee through the wilderness, and prevent thee from geographical error,\" but to keep thee altogether in the right path. s, to guard thy going out and thy coming m, to prevent thee from falling into any kind of wrong conduct. The place which I have prepared is not merely Palestine, but that place of which Palestine is the type - viz., Heaven. Compare John 14:2: - \"I go to prepare a place for you.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Provoke him not. On the disobedience of the Israelites to this precept, see Numbers 14:11; Psalm 78:17, 40, 56, etc. My name is in him. God's honour he will not give to another. He does not set His Name in a man. The angel, in whom was God's Blame, must have been co-equal with God - one of the Persons of the Blessed Trinity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - If thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak. The change of persons in the latter clause - \"all that I speak,\" instead of \"all that he speaks\" - implies the doctrine of the perienchoresis or circuminsessio, that God the Father is in the Son and the Spirit, as they are in him. An adversary to thy adversaries. Rather \"an afflictor of thy afflictors.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - The Amorites, and the Hittites, etc. The nations of Canaan proper, to whom the Gergashites are sometimes added. See the comment on 2 Samuel 3:8. I will cut them off. Or \"cut them down,\" i.e., destroy them from being any longer nations, but not exterminate them, as is generally supposed. David had a \"Hittite\" among his \"mighty men\" (2 Samuel 23:39), and was on friendly terms with Araunah the \"Jebusite\" (2 Samuel 24:18-24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works. It is always to be borne in mind that with the idolatries of the heathen were connected \"works of darkness,\" which it is shameful even to speak cf. The rites of Baal and Ashtoreth, of Chemosh, Molech, Rimmon, and the other Canaanite and Syrian deities were at once defiled by the abomination of human sacrifices, and polluted with the still more debasing evil of religious impurity. \"The sacrifice offered to Ash-toreth,\" says Dr. Dollinger, \"consisted in the prostitution of women: the women submitted themselves to the visitors of the feast, in the temple of the goddess or the adjoining precinct. A legend told of Astarte (Ashtoreth) having prostituted herself in Tyre for ten years: and in many places matrons, as well as maidens, consecrated themselves for a length of time, or on the festivals of the goddess, with a view of propitiating her, or earning her favour as hieroduli of unchastity... In this way they went so far at last as to contemplate the abominations of unnatural lust as a homage rendered to the deity, and to exalt it into a regular cultus. The worship of the goddess at Aphaca in Lebanon was specially notorious in this respect. The temple in a solitary situation was, as Eusebius tells us, a place of evil-doing for such as chose to ruin their bodies in scandalous ways... Criminal intercourse with women, impurity, shameful and degrading deeds, were practised in the temple, where there was no custom and no law, and no honourable or decent human being could be found.\" (Jew and Gentile, vol. 1. pp. 428, 429; Darnell's translation.) Thou shalt utterly overthrow them. The heathen gods are identified with their images. These were to be torn from their bases, overthrown, and rolled in the dust for greater contempt and ignominy. They were then to be broken up and burnt, till the gold and the silver with which they were overlaid was calcined and could be stamped to powder. Nothing was to be spared that had been degraded by idolatry, either for its beauty or its elaborate workmanship, or its value. All was hateful to God, and was to be destroyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - He shall bless thy bread and thy water. If the Israelites were exact in their obedience, and destroyed the idols, and served God only, then he promised to bless \"their bread and their water\" - the food, i.e., whether meat or drink, on which they subsisted, and to give them vigorous health, free from sickness of any kind, which he pledged himself to take away from the midst of them. Though Christians have no such special pledge, there is, no doubt, that virtuous and godly living would greatly conduce to health, and take away half the sicknesses from which men suffer, even at the present day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - There shall nothing out their young, nor be barren in thy land. This blessing could not have followed upon godly living in the way of natural sequence, but only by Divine favor and providential care. It would have rendered them rich in flocks and herds beyond any other nation. The number of thy days I will fulfil. There shall be no premature deaths. All, both men and women, shall reach the term allotted to man, and die in a good old age, having fulfilled their time. Godly living, persisted in for several generations, might, perhaps, produce this result.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I will send my fear before thee. The fear which fell upon the nations is seen first in the case of Balak and the Moabites. \"Moab was sore aft-aid of the people, because they were many\" (Numbers 22:3). Later it is spoken of by Rahab as general (Joshua 2:9, 11). A very signal indication of the alarm felt is given in the history of the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:3, 27). I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. For the fulfilment of this promise see Numbers 21:3, 24, 35; Numbers 31:7; Joshua 8:20-24; Joshua 10:10, etc. Had their obedience been more complete, the power of the Canaanitish nations would have been more thoroughly broken, and the sufferings and servitudes related in the Book of Judges would not have had to be endured.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And I will send hornets before thee. This is scarcely to be taken literally, since no actual plague of hornets is mentioned in the historical narrative. \"Hornets\" here, and in Deuteronomy 7:20; Joshua 24:12, are probably plagues or troubles of any kind, divinely sent to break the power of the heathen nations, and render them an easier prey to the Israelites, when they made their invasion. Possibly, the main \"hornets\" were the Egyptians, who, under Rameses III., successfully invaded Palestine about the time of Israel's sojourn in the wilderness, and weakened the power of the Hittites (Khita). The Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite. By a common figure of speech, a part is put {or the whole - three nations for seven. The three names seem to be taken at random, but include the two nations of most power - the Canaanites and the Hittites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - I will not drive them out from before thee in one year. The Divine action is for the most part \"slack, as men count slackness\" - it is not hasty, spasmodic, precipitate, as human action is too often. Men are impatient; God is strangely, wonderfully patient. He would not drive out the Canaanitish nations all at once -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Lest the land should become desolate, there being an insufficient population to keep down the weeds and maintain the tillage; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. Lest the beast of the field should multiply so as to become a danger to the new-comers. It is related that when the kingdom of Samaria was depopulated by the removal of the Ten Tribes, there was a great increase of lions, which preyed upon the scanty remnant left (2 Kings 17:25). Even in France, after the Franco-German war, it was found that in many districts wolves increased. A third reason why the nations were not subdued all at once, not mentioned here, is touched in Judges 2:21-23 - \"The Lord left those nations, without driving them out hastily, that through them he might prove Israel, whether they would keep the way of the Lord to walk therein, or not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines. This passage by itself would be sufficient to confute Dr. Brugsch's notion, that the Yam Suph (or \"Red Sea\" of our translators) is the Lake Serbonis, which is a part of the Mediterranean or \"Sea of the Philistines,\" and cannot stand in contrast with it. The \"Sea of the Philistines\" and the \"Red Sea\" mark the boundaries of the Holy Land East and West, as the \"Desert\" and the \"River\" (Euphrates) do its boundaries North and South. That Moses here lays down those wide limits which were only reached 400 years later, in the time of David and Solomon, and were then speedily lost, can surprise no one who believes in the prophetic gift, and regards Moses as one of the greatest of the Prophets. The tract marked out by these limits had been already promised to Abraham (Genesis 15:18). Its possession by Solomon is distinctly recorded in 1 Kings 4:21, 24; 2 Chronicles 9:26. As Solomon was \"a man of peace,\" we must ascribe the acquisition of this wide empire to David. (Compare 2 Samuel 8:3-14; 2 Samuel 10:6-19.) The river (han-nahar) is in the Pentateuch always the Euphrates. The Nile is ha-y' or. A powerful kingdom established in Syria is almost sure to extend its influence to the Euphrates. I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand. Compare Joshua 21:44, for the first fulfilment of this prophecy. Its complete fulfilment was reserved for the time of David. Thou shalt drive them out. The mass of the Canaanites were no doubt \"driven out\" rather than exterminated. They retired northwards, and gave strength to the great Hittite kingdom which was for many centuries a formidable antagomst of the Egyptian and Assyrian empties.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 23:32-33NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - FINAL WARNING AGAINST IDOLATRY. The \"Book of the Covenant\" ends as it began, with a solemn warning against idolatry. (See Exodus 20:23.) \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods.\" Thou shalt not even suffer them to dwell side by side with thee in the land, on peaceable terms, with their own laws and religion, lest thou be ensnared thereby, and led to worship their idols and join in their unhallowed rites (ver. 33). The after history of the people of Israel shows the need of the warning. From the exodus to the captivity, every idolatry with which they came into close contact proved a sore temptation to them. As the author of Kings observes of the Ten Tribes\" - The children of Israel did secretly those things which were not right against the Lord their God, and they built them high places in all their cities... And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree; and there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the Lord carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the Lord to anger; for they served idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, \"Ye shall not do this thing\" (2 Kings 17:9-12). Verse 32. - Thou shalt make no covenant with them. See below, Exodus 34:12-15. According to the forms usual at the time, a treaty of peace would have contained an acknowledgment of the gods of either nation, and words in honour of them. (See the \"Treaty of Rameses II. with the Hittites,\" given in the Records of the Past, vol. 4. pp. 27-32.) This would have been equivalent to \"making a covenant with their gods.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus23:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - They shall not dwell in the land. This law did not, of course, affect proselytes; nor was it considered to preclude the continuance in the land of the enslaved Gibeonites. It forbade any Canaanite communities being suffered to remain within the limits of Palestine on friendly terms with the Hebrews. The precaution was undoubtedly a wise one.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.24":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - THE RATIFICATION OF THE COVENANT. The giving of the Book of the Covenant being now completed, Moses, having received directions with respect to another ascent into the mount (vers. 1, 2), descended to the people, and in the first instance declared to them the main heads of the Covenant, which they received with favour, and expressed their willingness to obey (ver. 3). Not, however, regarding this as a sufficiently formal ratification, the Prophet proceeded to write out in a \"Book\" the whole of the commands which he had received, He then built an altar, erected twelve pillars, offered sacrifice, and having collected half the blood of the victims in basins, summoned the people to an assembly. At this, he read over solemnly all the words of the Book to them, and received their solemn adherence to it (ver. 7); whereupon, to complete the ceremony, and mark their entrance into covenant, he sprinkled the blood from the basins on the twelve tribes, represented by their leaders, and declared the acceptance complete (ver. 8). The ceremony was probably modelled on some customary proceedings, whereby important contracts between man and man were ratified among the Hebrews and Syrians. Verses 1, 2. - It has been supposed that these verses are out of place, and suggested to remove them to the end of verse 8. But no change is necessary. It is quite natural that God should have given the directions before Moses descended from the mount, and that he should have deferred executing them until the people had accepted the covenant. Nadab and Abihu were the two eldest of Aaron's sons, and so his natural successors in the priesthood, had they not sinned by offering \"strange fire\" (Leviticus 10:1, 2). They had been mentioned previously, in Exodus 6:23. Seventy of the elders. On the elders of Israel, see Exodus 3:16, and Exodus 18:21. The \"seventy\" eiders may, together with Nadab and Abihu, have represented the twelve tribes, six from each. Worship ye afar off. Though all were to ascend the mount to a certain height, only Moses was to go to the top. The others, being less holy than Moses, had to worship at a distance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And Moses came. Moses descended from the mount, and reported to the people all the words of the Lord - all the legislation contained in the last three chapters and a half (Exodus 20:19, to Exodus 23:33), not perhaps in extenso, but as to its main provisions. And all the people answered with one voice, promising obedience. In times of excitement, a common impulse constantly animates an entire multitude, and an exaltation of feeling leads them to make pledges, which they are very unwilling to stand by afterwards. Hence Moses requires something more than a verbal assent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Moses wrote all the words of the Lord. We may presume that they were miraculously brought to his remembrance by that Spirit of Truth which guided all the Prophets (2 Peter 1:21; John 14:26). Having written the words, he waited till the next day, and then rose up early and builded an altar, in preparation for the sacrifice without which no covenant was regarded as binding. And twelve pillars. Symbolical of the twelve tribes.

The Levitical priesthood not being as vet instituted, either all the people were regarded as holy, and so any one might offer sacrifice, or the \"young men\" selected may have been of the number of the first-born, who were priests in their respective families until the appointment of Aaron and his sons to be priests of the nation (Exodus 28:1). No doubt young men were selected as most competent to deal with struggling animals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Moses took half of the blood. The blood, which symbolised the life of the victim, was the essential part of every sacrifice, and was usually poured over the altar, or at any rate sprinkled upon it, as the very crowning act of offering. (See Leviticus 1:5; Leviticus 3:8; etc.) On this occasion Moses retained half of the blood, and put it in basins, for the purpose of so uniting all the people in the sacrifice, and thereby the more solemnly pledging them to the covenant, which the sacrifice at once consecrated and consummated. (See Hebrews 9:18-20.) The other half of the blood was, according to the usual practice, sprinkled upon the altar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And he took the Book of the Covenant. In this book we have the germ of the Holy Scriptures - the first \"book\" actually mentioned as written in the narrative of the Bible. Genesis may contain other older documents, inserted by Moses, under the sanction of the Holy Spirit, in his compilation. But his own composition, if we except the burst of poesy called forth by the passage of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-18), would seem to have commenced with \"the Book of the Covenant.\" Upon this nucleus the rest of the law was based; and it was to explain and enforce the law that Moses composed the Pentateuch. In the audience of the people, Literally, \"in the ears of the people,\" which is equally intelligible, and more graphic. And they said, etc The people made the same answer as before (ver. 3), adding a general promise of obedience to all that God might command in future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moses then proceeded to the final act - He took the blood from the basins, and sprinkled it - not certainly upon all the people, who numbered above two millions - but upon their leaders and representatives, the \"elders\" and other chief men, drawn up at the head of each tribe, and thus brought within his reach. It has been supposed by some that he merely sprinkled the blood on the twelve pillars, as representing the twelve tribes; but, had this been the case, the expression in the text would probably have been different. We read, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that he \"sprinkled both the book, and all the people\" (Hebrews 9:19). As he sprinkled, he said, Behold the blood of the covenant, etc. It was a common practice among the nations of antiquity to seal covenants with blood. Sometimes the blood was that of a victim, and the two parties to the covenant prayed, that, if they broke it, his fate might be theirs (Hom. 1l. 3:298; 19:252; Leviticus 1:24; 21:45; etc.). Sometimes it was the blood of the two parties themselves, who each drank of the other's blood, and thereby contracted a blood-relationship, which would have made their breaking the covenant more unpardonable (Herod. 1:74; 4:70; Tacit. Ann. 12:47). Moses seems to have followed neither practice at all closely, but, adopting simply the principle that a covenant required to be sealed with blood, to have arranged the details as he thought best. By the sprinkling of both the altar and the people the two parties to the covenant were made partakers of one and the same blood, and so brought into a sort of sacramental union.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 24:9-11NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - THE SACRIFICIAL FEAST AND THE VISION OF GOD. After the covenant had been ratified by the unanimous voice of the people, Moses proceeded to carry out the injunctions with respect to Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the elders, which he had received while still in the mount (see the comment on vers. 1, 2). Taking them with him, he ascended Sinai once more to a certain height, but clearly not to the summit, which he alone was privileged to visit (vers. 2 and 12). The object of the ascent was twofold.NEWLINENEWLINE1. A sacrificial meal always followed upon a sacrifice; and the elders might naturally desire to partake of it as near the Divine presence as should be permitted them. This was their purpose in ascending.NEWLINENEWLINE2. God desired to impress them with a sense of his awful majesty and beauty, and was prepared for this end to manifest himself to them in some strange and wonderful way as they were engaged in the solemn meal (ver. 11). This was his purpose in inviting their presence. The manifestation is described in ver. 10. It was a \"vision of God,\" but of what exact nature it is impossible to say. Having recorded it, the author parenthetically notes that the Divine vision did not destroy any of those who beheld it, or cause them any injury, as might have been expected. Verse 9. - Then went up. Compare ver. 1. The mountain was to be partially ascended, but not to any great height. Nadab, Abihu, and the elders were to \"worship God afar off.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - They saw the God of Israel. These words can scarcely mean less than that they saw with their bodily eyes some appearance of the Divine being who had summoned them to his presence for the purpose. Moses, we know, saw a \"similitude of God\" (Numbers 12:8). Isaiah \"saw the Lord sitting upon his throne \"(Isaiah 6:1). Ezekiel saw upon the throne \"the appearance of a man\" (Ezekiel 1:26). It does not follow from Deuteronomy 4:12, 15, that the elders saw no similitude, since in that passage Moses is speaking, not to the elders, but to the people, and referring, not to what occurred at the sacrificial feast after the ratification of the covenant, but to the scene at the giving of the Ten Commandments previously (Exodus 20:1-18). What the form was which the elders saw, we are not told; but as it had \"feet,\" it was probably a human form. It may have been hazy, indefinite, \"too dazzling bright for mortal eye\" to rest upon. But it was a true \"vision of God\" - and, as Keil says, \"a foretaste of the blessedness of the sight of God in eternity.\" There was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a sapphire stone. Rather, \"and under his feet was, as it were, a work of clear sapphire.\" Nothing is said concerning a pavement, but only that below the feet of the figure which they saw was something, which looked as if it were made of bright blue sapphire stone, something as clear and as blue as the blue of heaven. Canon Cook supposes the actual sky to be meant; but the expression, \"as it were, the body of heaven,\" or \"like the very heaven,\" makes this impossible. A thing is not like itself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The nobles - i.e., the notables - the seventy elders, and other persons, already mentioned (vers. 1, 9). He laid not his hand. God did not smite them with death, or pestilence, or even blindness. It was thought to be impossible to see God and live. (See above, Genesis 32:30; Exodus 32:20; Judges 6:22, 23, etc.) Man was unworthy to draw near to God in any way; and to look on him was viewed as a kind of profanity. Yet some times he chose to show himself, in vision or otherwise, to his people, and then, as there could be no guilt on their part, there was no punishment on his. It is generally supposed that, in all such cases, it was the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity who condescended to show himself. Also they saw God. Rather, \"they both saw God, and did eat and drink.\" The two were simultaneous. As they were engaged in the sacrificial meal, God revealed himself to them.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 24:12-18NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-18. - MOSES' ENTRY INTO THE CLOUD, AND FORTY DAYS' COMMUNE WITH GOD. It was necessary now that Moses should receive full directions for the external worship of God, the sanctuary, and the priesthood. Every religion has something tangible and material about it - holy places, holy things, rites, ceremonies, rules, forms, regulations. If man sets himself to devise these things of his own head, he may very easily go wrong, and find his elaborate inventions \"an offence\" to God. To avoid this - to secure the result that all should be pleasing and acceptable to \"the High and Holy One which inhabiteth eternity,\" it was thought fitting that \"patterns\" should be shown to Moses of all that was to be made for the worship (Hebrews 8:5), and exact details given him with respect to the material, size, shape, and construction of each. The results are put before us in seven chapters (chs. 25-31.). For the purpose of allowing ample time for the communications which had to be made and of securing that undivided attention which was requisite in order that all should remain fixed in the memory, God summoned his servant to a long and solitary colloquy, on the mountain summit whereon the cloud rested (Exodus 19:18), apart from all his people. Moses, of course, obeyed; but before ascending, arranged with the elders that in his absence Aaron and Hur should have the direction of affairs, and decide all doubtful questions (ver. 14). He then went up the mountain, accompanied for part of the way by Joshua, who is now spoken of as his \"minister,\" or \"attendant\" (ver. 13). Joshua probably remained with him for six days, while Moses waited for a summons to enter the cloud. On the seventh day the summons came: and Moses, leaving Joshua, entered the cloud, and was hid from the sight of all men. Verse 12. - Come up to me. Moses, apparently, had descended again into the plain, with Aaron and the seventy elders, after the festival was over. (See ver. 14, and compare Exodus 32:1.) He is now commanded to reascend, and be there - i.e., \"And continue there\" - foreshadowing the length of the stay. Tables of stone, and a law, and commandments, etc. Literally, \"Tables of stone, and the law and the commandments which I have written.\" The three expressions alike refer to the Decalogue, which alone God wrote. That thou mayest teach them. Rather,\" to teach them.\" God wrote the commandments on stone, in order to inculcate them with the greater force upon his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Moses went up. Prompt to obey, Moses, though he had only just descended from the mount, immediately made ready to set forth and again ascend it. This time he was attended by his minister, Joshua, whose arm he had employed on a former occasion against the Amalekites (Exodus 17:9-13). The name, Joshua, is, however, still given him by anticipation, since he did not receive it until he was sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (Numbers 13:8, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And he said unto the elders. Before taking his departure for the long sojourn implied in God's address to him, \"Come up to me into the mount, and be there\" (ver. 12), Moses thought it necessary to give certain directions to the elders as to what they should do in his absence -NEWLINENEWLINE1. They were to remain where they were - i.e., in the plain at the foot of Sinai, until his return, however long it should be delayed.NEWLINENEWLINE2. They were to regard Aaron and Hur as their leaders, and his (Moses') representatives. In case of any difficulty arising, they were to refer the matter to them. On Hur see the comment upon Exodus 17:12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Moses went up into the mount. Having made the necessary arrangements for the government of the people during his absence, Moses ascended, in company with Joshua, to the upper part of the mountain, and there waited for some further summons. A cloud, or, rather, the cloud previously mentioned (Exodus 19:16), stood gathered upon the highest eminence, and marked the special presence of God there. Moses, though called up into the mount, would not intrude into this inner sanctuary, until specially bidden to enter it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Now occurred a remarkable pause. The summons had been given to Moses, and he had obeyed it. He was there on the platform a little below the summit, ready, but waiting for a further call. The call was not made for six days. A holy calm reigned upon Sinai - the cloud rested upon the summit, and in the cloud was the glory of the Lord. Moses and Joshua waited near - but for six days there was no sign. God thus taught Moses, and through him the world, that near approach to him requires long and careful preparation. Moses, no doubt, was occupied during the six days in continual prayer. At last, on the seventh day, the call, which Moses had expected, came. God called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. God summoned him to a closer approach - bade him enter the cloud - and draw as nigh to him as possible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17 - Meanwhile, to those below in the plain, \"the glory of the Lord\" on the summit above them, was like devouring fire on the top of the mount. They had but to lift their eyes thither, and they saw his wonderful glory - showing like a huge fire - on the spot from which he had spoken to them (Exodus 20:18). This manifestation continued certainly for the first six days; whether it lasted longer or not is open to question.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And Moses went into the midst of the cloud. Quitting Joshua, Moses at last, in obedience to the call out of the midst of the cloud, entered within its shadow and disappeared from human vision In this abnormal condition, alone with God, he continued for thirty-four days, making, together with the six days before he entered the cloud, the forty days and forty nights of the text before us. It is noted in Deuteronomy 9:9, that during the whole of this time he was without food. Compare Elijah's fast (1 Kings 19:8), and our blessed Lord's (Matthew 3:2).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - THE TABERNACLE AND THE GIFTS FOR IT. The great principles of the moral law had been given in the Ten Commandments uttered by God amid the thunders of Sinai. The \"Book of the Covenant,\" or short summary of the main laws, civil, political, and social, had been communicated to Moses, and by him reduced to a written form (Exodus 24:4). A solemn league and covenant had been entered into between God and his people, the people undertaking to keep all the words of the Lord, and God to be their Protector, Guide, and King. But no form of worship had been set up. Abstract monotheism had been inculcated; and worship had been so far touched upon that an \"altar\" had been mentioned, and certain directions, chiefly negative, had been given with respect to it (Exodus 20:24-26). It remained that the abstract monotheism should be enshrined in forms, obtain a local habitation, and be set forth before the eyes, and so fixed in the heart and affections of the people. God was now about to declare to Moses what the character of the habitation should be, its size, form, and materials. But before doing this, as a first and fitting, if not necessary, preliminary, he required of the people to bring of the best of their possessions for the service which he was about to institute, enumerating the substances which he would condescend to receive at their hands, and especially enjoining upon them that all should be offered willingly and from the heart (ver. 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Speak unto the children of Israel that they bring me an offering. The word translated \"offering\" is that commonly rendered\" heave-offering;\" but it seems to be used here (as in Exodus 30:13; Exodus 35:5, etc.) in a generic sense. The propriety of the people, when God was about establishing his habitation among them, presenting to God all the materials needed, is self-evident and requires no comment. Of every man that giveth it willingly. Literally, \"of every man whose heart drives him.\" God will have no gifts but such as are freely offered. He \"loveth a cheerful giver. If a man gives grudgingly or of necessity,\" God rejects the gift. On the noble spirit which the people showed when the appeal was made to them, see Exodus 35:21-29; and Exodus 36:37NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This is the offering - gold and silver and brass. Gold was needed for the overlaying of the boards, whereof the ark was composed (ver. 11); for the \"crown of gold,\" which surmounted it (ibid.); for the \"rings\" (ver. 12); the \"mercy-seat\" (ver. 17) - the cherubim (ver. 18); the dishes, the spoons, the covers, the bowls (ver. 29); the candlestick (ver. 31); the tongs and snuff dishes (ver. 28); the hooks and taches (Exodus 26:6, 32); for the covering of the table of shew bread (Exodus 25:24); and of the staves and pillars (ib, 28: Exodus 26:32, 37); and also for many parts of the dress of the High Priest (Exodus 28:6, 8, 11, 14, etc.). Silver was required for the sockets which supported the hoards of the Tabernacle (Exodus 26:19); and for the \"hooks\" and \"fillets\" of the pillars of the court (Exodus 27:10) Brass, or rather bronze, was wanted for the \"taches\" which coupled together the curtains of the tent (Exodus 26:11); for the \"sockets\" which received the pillars or tent-poles (ib, 37); for the external coating of the altar (Exodus 27:2); for the vessels and utensils of the altar (ib, 3); for the covering of its staves (ib, 6); for the sockets of the pillars of the Court (Exodus 27:10); for the \"pins\" of the Court (ib, 19); and generally for the vessels of the Tabernacle (ibid.). To understand how the Israelites could supply all that was wanted, we must remember,NEWLINENEWLINE1. That they had a certain amount of ancestral wealth, as that which Joseph had accumulated, and what Jacob and his sons had brought with them into Egypt.NEWLINENEWLINE2. That they had received large presents of gold and silver from the Egyptians just before their departure (Exodus 12:35); andNEWLINENEWLINE3. That they had recently defeated, and no doubt despoiled, the Amalekites (Exodus 16:8-13). Whether they had further made money by trade since they entered the Sinaitic peninsula, may be doubted. The supposition is not at all needed in order to account for their wealth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And blue, and purple, and scarlet. Cloths of these three colours seem to be meant. The material was probably wool; the blue dye probably indigo, which was the ordinary blue dye of Egypt; the purple was no doubt derived from one or other of the shell-fish so well-known to the Syrians (of which the one most used was the Murex trunculus), and was of a warm reddish hue, not far from crimson; the scarlet (literally, \"scarlet worm\" or \"worm scarlet,\") was the produce of the Corcus ilicis, or cochineal insect of the holm oak, which has now been superseded by the Coccus cacti, or cochineal insect of the prickly pear, introduced into Europe from Mexico. And fine linen. The word used is Egyptian. It seems to have designated properly the fine linen spun from flax in Egypt, which was seldom dyed. and was of a beautiful soft white hue. The fineness of the material is extraordinary, equalling that of the best Indian muslins (Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. 3. p. 121). It would seem that the Israelite women spun the thread from the flax (Exodus 35:25), and that the skilled workmen employed by Moses wove the thread into linen (ib, 35). And goat's hair. The soft inner wool of the Angora goat was also spun by the women into a fine worsted (ib, 26), which was woven into cloths, used especially as coverings for tents.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And rams' skins dyed red. The manufacture of leather was well-known in Egypt from an early date, and the Libyan tribes of North Africa were celebrated for their skill in preparing and dyeing the material (Herod. 4:189). Scarlet was one of the colours which they peculiarly affected (ibid.). We must suppose that the skins spoken of had been brought with them by the Israelites cut of Egypt. And badgers' skins. It is generally agreed among moderns that this is a wrong translation. Badgers are found in Palestine, but not either in Egypt or in the wilderness. The Hebrew takhash is evidently the same word as the Arabic tukhash or dukhash, which is applied to marine animals only, as to seals, dolphins, dugongs, and perhaps sharks and dog-fish. \"Seals' skins\" would perhaps be the best translation. (Compare Plin. H. N. 2:55; Sueton. Octav § 90.) Shittim wood. It is generally agreed that the Shittah (plural Shittim) was an acacia, whether the seyal (Acacia seyal) which now grows so abundantly in the Sinaitic peninsula, or the Acacia Nilotica, or the Serissa, is uncertain. The seyal wood is \"hard and close-grained of an orange colour with a darker heart, well-adapted for cabinet work;\" but the tree, as it exists nowadays, could certainly not furnish the planks, ten cubits long by one and a half wide, which were needed for the Tabernacle (Exodus 35:21). The Serissa might do so, but it is not now found in the wilderness. We are reduced to supposing either that the seyal grew to a larger size anciently than at present, or that the serissa was more widely spread than at the present day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Oil for the light. That the sanctuary to be erected would require to be artificially lighted is assumed. Later, a \"candlestick\" is ordered (vers. 31-37). The people were to provide the oil which was to be burnt in the \"candlestick.\" In Exodus 27:20, we are told that the oil was to be \"pure oil olive beaten.\" Spices for anointing oil. Anointing oil would be needed for the sanctification of the Tabernacle, the ark, and all the holy vessels, as also for the consecration of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood. The spices required are enumerated in Exodus 30:23, 24. They consisted of pure myrrh, sweet cinnamon, sweet calamus, and cassia. And for sweet incense. The spices needed for the incense were, according to our translators, stacte, onycha, galbanum and frankincense (ib, 34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Onyx stones. On the need of onyx stones, see Exodus 28:9, 20. Stones to be set in the ephod, etc. Rather, \"stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastplate.\" The only stones required for the ephod were two large onyx stones; for the breastplate twelve jewels were needed (ibid. 17-20), one of them being an onyx. It has been proposed to translate the Hebrew shoham by \"beryl\" instead of \"onyx;\" but onyx, which is more suitable for engraving, is probably right.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 25:8-9NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - GENERAL DIRECTIONS. After the gifts which God will accept have been specified, and the spirit in which they are to be offered noted (ver. 2), God proceeds to unfold his purpose, and declare the object for which the gifts are needed. He will have a \"sanctuary\" constructed for him, an habitation in which he may \"dwell.\" Now, it is certainly possible to conceive of a religion which should admit nothing in the nature of a temple or sanctuary; and there are even writers who tell us that a religion has actually existed without one (Herod. 1:131, Strab. 15. pp, 1039-41) That God should \"dwell\" in a house, as a man does, is of course impossible; and the Hebrews were as deeply impressed with this truth as any other nation (1 Kings 8:27; 2 Chronicles 2:6; Isaiah 56:1; Jeremiah 23:24, etc.). But a religion without a temple was probably unknown in the days of Moses; and, with such a people as the Hebrews, it is inconceivable that religion could have maintained its ground for long without something of the kind. \"It was,\" as Kalisch says, \"above all things necessary to create a firm and visible centre of monotheism, to keep perpetually the idea of the one omnipotent God alive in the minds of the people, and so to exclude for ever a relapse into the pagan and idolatrous aberrations\" (Comment on Exodus, p. 365). A sanctuary was therefore to be constructed; but, as the nation was in the peculiar position of being nomadic, without fixed abode, that is, and constantly on the move, the usual form of a permanent building was unsuitable under the circumstances. To meet the difficulty, a tent-temple was designed, which is called mishkan, \"the dwelling,\" or ohel, \"the tent,\" which was simply an Oriental tent on a large scale, made of the best obtainable materials, and guarded by an enclosure. The details of the work are reserved for later mention. In the present passage two directions only are given: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. A sanctuary is to be constructed; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. Both it, and all its vessels, are to be made after patterns which God was about to show to Moses. Verse 8. - A sanctuary well expresses the Hebrew micdash, which is derived from cadash - \"to be holy.\" It is a name never given to the temples of the heathen deities. That I may dwell among them. Compare Exodus 29:45; Numbers 35:34. There is a sense in which \"God dwelleth not in temples made with hands\"(Acts 7:48; Acts 17:24) - i.e., he is not comprehended in them, or confined to them; but there is another sense in which he may be truly said to dwell in them, viz., as manifesting himself in them either to the senses, or to the spirit. In the tabernacle he manifested himself sensibly (Exodus 40:34, 35, 38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The patterns. Many of the old Jewish commentators supposed, that Moses was shown by God a real material structure, which actually existed in the heavens, far grander than its earthly copy, after which he was to have the tabernacle fashioned. Some recent Christian writers, without going these lengths, suggest that \"an actual picture or model of the earthly tabernacle and its furniture was shown to him\" (Keil). But the words of the text, as well as those of Acts 7:44, and Hebrews 8:5, are sufficiently justified, if we take a view less material than either of these - i.e., if we suppose Moses to have had impressed on his mind, in vision, the exact appearance of the tabernacle and its adjuncts, in such sort that he could both fully understand, and also, when necessary, supplement, the verbal descriptions subsequently given to him. It is unnecessary to inquire how the impression was produced. God who in vision communicated to Ezekiel the entire plan of that magnificent temple which he describes in ch. 40-42, could certainly have made known to Moses, in the same way, the far simpler structure of the primitive Tabernacle.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 25:10-22NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-22. - THE PATTERN OF THE ARK. - Moses is first shown, not the pattern of the tabernacle, but the patterns of those things which it was to contain - the ark, the table of shew-bread, and the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp-stand, with its appurtenances. The ark, as the very most essential part of the entire construction, is described first. Verse 10. - Thou shalt make an ark of shittim wood. Arks were an ordinary part of the religious furniture of temples in Egypt, and were greatly venerated. They usually contained a figure or emblem, of some deity. Occasionally they were in the shape of boats; but the most ordinary form was that of a cupboard or chest. They were especially constructed for the purpose of being carried about in a procession, and had commonly rings at the side, through which poles were passed on such occasions. It must be freely admitted, that the general idea of the \"Ark,\" as well as certain points in its ornamentation, was adopted from the Egyptian religion. Egyptian arks were commonly of sycamore wood. Two cubits and a half, etc. As there is no reason to believe that the Hebrew cubit differed seriously from the cubits of Greece and Rome, we may safely regard the Ark of the Covenant as a chest or box, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide, and two feet three inches deep.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou shalt overlay it with pure gold. Or, \"cover it with pure gold.\" As gilding was well known in Egypt long before the time of the exodus, it is quite possible that the chest was simply gilt without and within. It may, however, have been overlaid with thin plates of gold (a practice also known in Egypt, and common elsewhere) - which is the view taken by the Jewish commentators. The crown of gold was probably an ornamental moulding or edging round the top of the chest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Four rings of gold. These rings were to be fixed, not at the upper, but at the lower corners of the chest, which are called pa'amoth, literally \"feet\" or \"bases.\" The object was, no doubt, that no part of the chest should come in contact with the persons of the priests when carrying it (see ver. 14). As Kalisch notes, \"the smallness of the dimensions of the ark rendered its safe transportation, even with the rings at its feet, not impossible.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Staves of shittim wood. Similar staves, or poles, are to be seen in the Egyptian sculptures, attached to arks, thrones, and litters, and resting on the shoulders of the men who carry such objects.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - That the ark may be borne with them. The Hebrew ark was not made, like the Egyptian arks, for processions, and was never exhibited in the way of display, as they were. The need of carrying it arose from the fact, that the Israelites had not yet obtained a permanent abode. As soon as Canaan was reached, the ark had a fixed locality assigned to it, though the locality was changed from time to time (Joshua 18:1; 1 Samuel 4:3; 1 Samuel 7:1; 2 Samuel 6:10, etc.); but in the desert it required to be moved each time that the congregation changed its camping-ground.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The staves, when once inserted into the rings of the ark, were never to be taken from them. The object probably was that there might be no need of touching even the rings, when the ark was set down or taken up. The bearers took hold of the staves only, which were no part of the ark. On the danger of touching the ark itself, see 2 Samuel 6:6, 7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The testimony which I will give thee, is undoubtedly the Decalogue, or in other words, the two tables of stone, written with the finger of God, and forming his testimony against sin. (Compare Deuteronomy 31:26, 27.) The main intention of the ark was to be a repository in which the two tables should be laid up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou shalt make a mercy seat. Modern exegesis has endeavoured to empty the word kapporeth of its true meaning, witnessed to by the Septuagint, as well as by the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 9:5). It tells us that a kapporeth is simply a cover, \"being derived from kaphar, to cover,\" - used in Genesis 5:14, with respect to covering the ark with pitch. But the truth is that kapporeth is not derived from kaphar, but from kipper, the Piel form of the same verb, which has never any other sense than that of covering, or forgiving sins. In this sense it is used in the Old Testament some seventy times. Whether the mercy seat was the real cover of the ark of the covenant, or whether that had its own lid of acacia wood, as Kalisch supposes, is uncertain. At any rate, it was not called kipporeth because it was a cover, but because it was a seat of propitiation. On the importance of the mercy seat, as in some sort transcending the ark itself, see Leviticus 16:2, and 1 Chronicles 28:11. Atonement was made by sprinkling the blood of expiation upon it (Leviticus 16:14, 15). Of pure gold, Not of wood, plated with metal, or richly gilt, but of solid gold - an oblong slab, three feet nine inches long, two feet three inches wide, and probably not less than an inch thick. The weight of such a slab would be above 750 lbs. troy, and its value above 25,000l. of our money. The length and breadth were exactly those of the ark itself, which the mercy seat thus exactly covered (ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Two cherubims. The form \"cherubims,\" which our translators affect, is abnormal and indefensible. They should have said either \"cherubim,\" or \"cherubs.\" The exact shape of the Temple cherubim was kept a profound secret among the Jews, so that Josephus declares - \"No one is able to state, or conjecture of what form the cherubim were\" (Ant. Jud. 8:3, § 3). That they were winged figures appears from verse 28 of this chapter, while from other parts of Scripture we learn that cherubim might be of either human or animal forms, or of the two combined (Ezekiel 1:5-14; Ezekiel 10:1-22). These last have been with some reason compared to the symbolical composite figures of other nations, the andro-sphinxes and crio-sphinxes of the Egyptians, the Assyrian winged bulls and lions, the Greek chimaerae, and the griffins of the northern nations. But it is doubtful whether the cherubim of Moses were of this character. The most sober of recent inquirers (Bp. Harold Browne, Canon Cook, Kalisch, Keil),while admitting the point to be doubtful, come to the conclusion that they were in all probability, \"winged human figures, with human face too.\" In this case their prototype would seem to have been the winged figures of Ma, the Goddess of Truth, frequently seen inside Egyptian arks, sheltering with their wings the scarabaeus or other emblem of the deity. (See Lepsius, Denkmaler, pt. 3. pl. 14; Wilkinson in Rawlinson's Herodotus, vol. it. p. 85, 2nd edition; Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 1. p. 3040 Of beaten work shalt thou make them. Not cast, i.e., but hammered into shape (LXX. τορευτά. The word \"cherub\" is thought to be derived from an Egyptian root, karabu, signifying \"to hammer\" (Speaker's Commentary, vol. 4. p. 207). In the two ends. Rather, \"From the two ends\" - i.e., \"rising,\" or, \"standing up from the two ends.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - On the one end on the other end... on the two ends. The preposition used is in every case the same as that of the last clause of ver. 18 - viz., min, \"from.\" The idea is that the figures rose from the two ends.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high. Compare Exodus 37:9. It would seem that the two wings of both cherubs were advanced in front of them, and elevated, so as to overshadow the mercy seat. This was a departure from the patterns furnished by the figures of Ma (see the comment on ver. 18), since in them one wing only was elevated, and the other depressed. It is clear that in no case was any part of the Hebrew sacred furniture a mere reproduction of Egyptian models. Whatever was made use of was so transformed or modified as to acquire a new and independent character. Their faces, etc. The words are not without difficulty; but the generally received meaning appears to be correct that the faces were bent one towards the other, but that both looked downwards, towards the mercy seat. Thus the figures, whether they were standing or kneeling, which is uncertain, presented the appearance of guardian angels, who watched over the precious deposit below - to wit, the two tables.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thou shalt put the mercy seat above the ark. Rather, \"upon the ark\" - \"thou shalt cover the ark with it.\" This had not been expressed previously, though the dimensions (ver. 17), compared with those of the ark (ver. 10), would naturally have suggested the idea. In the ark thou shalt put the testimony. This is a mere repetition of verse 16, marking the special importance which attached to the provision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And there I will meet with thee. The whole of the foregoing description has been subordinate to this. In all the arrange-meats for the tabernacle God was, primarily and mainly, providing a fit place where he might manifest himself to Moses and his successors. The theocracy was to be a government by God in reality, and not in name only. There was to be constant \"communing\" between God and the earthly ruler of the nation, and therefore a place of communing. Compare Exodus 29:42-45. The special seat of the Divine presence was to be the empty space above the mercy seat, between the two cherubim, and above the ark of the covenant.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 25:23-30NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-30. - THE TABLE OF SHEW-BREAD. From the description of the ark, which constituted the sole furniture of the most holy place, God proceeded to describe the furniture of the holy place, or body of the tabernacle, which was to consist of three objects -NEWLINENEWLINE1. A table, called the table of shew-bread (\"bread of presence\" or \"bread of setting-forth\").NEWLINENEWLINE2. A candelabrum, or lamp-stand; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. An altar for the offering of incense. Of these the table seems to have been regarded as of primary importance; and its description is therefore made to follow immediately on that of the ark. It was of acacia wood, overlaid with pure gold, and was of the most ordinary shape - oblong-square, i.e., with four legs, one at each corner. The only peculiar features of the table, besides its material, were the border, or edging, which surrounded it at the top, the framework which strengthened the legs (ver. 25), and the rings by which it was to be carried from place to place. Verse 23. - Two cubits shall be the length thereof, etc. The table was to be three feel long, one foot six inches broad, and two feet three inches high. It was thus quite a small table, narrow for its length, and about two inches below the ordinary height.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thou shalt overlay it with pure gold. Again, gilding may be meant; but a covering with thin plates of gold is perhaps more probable. A crown of gold round about. A border, or edging round the top, which would prevent anything that was placed on the table from readily falling off. (Compare ver. 11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - A border of a hand-breadth. Rather \"a band\" or \"framing.\" This seems to have been a broad flat bar, placed about hallway down the legs, uniting them and holding them together. It was represented in the sculpture of the table which adorned the Arch of Titus. (See the Speaker's Commentary, vol. 1. p. 363.) A golden crown to the border - i.e., an edging at the top of the bar, which could be only for ornament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The four corners that are on the four feet, is scarcely an intelligible expression. Pe'oth, the word translated \"corners,\" means properly \"ends;\" and the direction seems to be, that the four rings should be affixed to the four \"ends\" of the table; those ends, namely, which are \"at the four feet.\" It is a periphrasis, meaning no more than that they should be affixed to the feet, as Josephus tells us that they were. (Ant. Jud. 3:6, § 6.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOver against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Over against the border. Rather \"opposite the band\" or \"framing\" - i.e., opposite the points at which the \"band\" or \"framing\" was inserted into the legs. Bishop Patrick supposes that the table \"was not carried up as high as the ark was, but hung down between the priests, on whose shoulders the staves rested.\" But it is carried upright in the bas-relief on the Arch of Titus, and might have been as easily so carried as the ark. (See the comment on ver. 12.) Of the staves. Rather, \"for staves.\" Staves for the table had not yet been mentioned; and naturally the word has no article.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The dishes thereof. Literally\" its dishes,\" or rather perhaps, \"its bowls\" (LXX. τρύβλια). They were probably the vessels in which the loaves were brought to the table. Loaves are often seen arranged in bowls in the Egyptian tomb decorations (Lepsius, Denkmaler, pt. 2, pls. 5, 19, 84, 129, etc.). Spoons thereof. Rather, \"its incense cups\" - small jars or pots in which the incense, offered with the loaves (Leviticus 24:5), was to be burnt. Two such were represented in the bas-relief of the table on the Arch of Titus. Covers thereof and bowls thereof. Rather, \"its flagons and its chalices\" (LXX. σπονδεῖα καὶ κύαθοι) - vessels required for the libations or \"drink offerings\" which accompanied every meat-offering. To cover withal Rather, as in the margin, \"to pour out withal.\" So the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and most of the Targums.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Thou shalt set upon the table shew-bread before me alway. Here we have at once the object of the table, and its name, explained. The table was to have set upon it continually twelve loaves, or cakes, of bread (Leviticus 24:5), which were to be renewed weekly on the sabbath-day (ibid. ver. 8), the stale loaves being at the same time consumed by the priests in the holy place. These twelve loaves or cakes were to constitute a continual thank-offering to God from the twelve tribes of Israel in return for the bless-Lugs of life and sustenance which they received from him. The bread was called \"bread of face,\" or \"bread of presence,\" because it was set before the \"face\" or \"presence\" of God, which dwelt in the holy of holies. The Septuagint renders the phrase by ἄρτοι ἐνώπιοι \"loaves that are face to face\" - St. Matthew by ἄρτοι τῆς προθέσεως, \"loaves of setting-forth\" - whence the Schaubrode of Luther, and our \"shew-bread,\" which is a paraphrase rather than a translation.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 25:31 THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK (vers. 31-40). Though the holy of holies was always dark, unless when lighted by. the glory of God (Exodus 40:34, 35), the holy place, in which many of the priests' functions were to be performed, was to be always kept light. In the day-time sufficient light entered from the porch in front; but, as evening drew on, some artificial illumination was required. In connection with this object, the golden candlestick, or rather lamp-stand, was designed, which, together with its appurtenances, is described in the remainder of the chapter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - A candlestick. The golden candlestick is figured upon the Arch of Titus, and appears by that representation to have consisted of an upright shaft, from which three curved branches were carried out on either side, all of them in the same plane. It stands there on an octagonal pedestal, in two stages, ornamented with figures of birds and sea-monsters. This pedestal is, however, clearly Roman work, and no part of the original. Of beaten work. Not cast, but fashioned by the hand, like the cherubim (ver. 18). His shaft. Rather, \"its base\" (literally \"flank\"). His branches. Our version follows the Septuagint; but the Hebrew noun is in the singular number, and seems to designate the upright stem, or shaft. The \"branches are not mentioned till ver. 32, where the same noun is used in the plural. His bowls, his knops, and his flowers. Rather, \"its cups, its pomegranates, and its lilies.\" The \"cups\" are afterwards likened to almond flowers (ver. 33); they formed the first ornament on each branch; above them was a representation of the pomegranate fruit; above this a lily blossom. The lily-blossoms supported the lamps, which were separate (ver. 37). The remainder were of one piece with the candlestick.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Six branches. The representation on the Arch of Titus exactly agrees with this description. It was a peculiarity of the \"candlestick,\" as compared with other candelabra, that all the branches were in the same plane.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThree bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Three bowls made like unto almonds. Cups shaped like almond blossoms seem to be intended. Each branch had three of these in succession, then a pomegranate and a lily-flower. The lily probably represented the Egyptian lotus, or water-lily. In the other branch. Rather, \"on another branch.\" There were six branches, not two only. The ornamentation of two is described; then we are told that the remainder were similar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - In the candlestick: i.e., in the central shaft or stem, which is viewed as \"the candlestick\" par excellence. Here were to be twelve ornaments, the series of cup, pomegranate, and lily being repeated four times, once in connection with each pair of branches, and a fourth time at the summit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - A knop under two branches of the same. The branches were to quit the stem at the point of junction between the pomegranate (knop) and the lily.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - All it. Rather, \"all of it.\" Shall be one beaten work. Compare ver. 31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The seven lamps. The lamps are not described. They appear by the representation on the Arch of Titus to have been hemispherical bowls on a stand, which fitted into the lily-blossom wherewith each of the seven branches terminated. They shall light the lamps. The lamps were lighted every evening at sunset (Exodus 27:21; Exodus 30:8; Leviticus 24:3, etc.), and burnt till morning, when the High Priest extinguished them and \"dressed\" them (Exodus 30:7). That they may give light over against it. The candlestick was placed on the southern side of the holy place, parallel to the wall, the seven lamps forming a row. The light was consequently shed strongly on the opposite, or northern wall, where the table of show-bread stood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - The tongs thereof. Tongs or pincers were required for trimming the wicks of the lamps. Compare 1 Kings 7:49; 2 Chronicles 4:21. Snuff-dishes were also needed for the reception of the fragments removed from the wicks by the tongs. \"Snuffers,\" though the word is used in Exodus 37:23, in the place of tongs, had not been indented, and were indeed unknown to the ancients.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it. The candlestick, with all its appurtenances, was to weigh exactly a talent of gold. The value of the Hebrew gold talent is supposed to have been between 10,000l. and 11,000l. of our money.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus25:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount. Compare ver. 9, and the comment ad loc. It would seem from this passage that the \"patterns\" were shown to Moses first, and the directions as to the making given afterwards.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.26":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-37. - THE TABERNACLE. The sacred furniture which the tabernacle was to contain having been described, with the exception of the \"altar of incense\" the description of which is reserved for ch 30. (vers. 1-10)-directions were next given for the sacred structure itself. This was to consist of three main things -NEWLINENEWLINE1. A quadrangular enclosure thirty cubits long by ten broad, open at one end, and on the other three sides enclosed by boards of acacia-wood overlaid with gold - called the mishkan, or \"the dwelling-place,\" in our version usually translated \"tabernacle.\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. A tent of goat's hair, supported upon poles, and stretched by means of ropes and tent-pegs in the ordinary manner over the mishkan. This is called the ohel - which is the usual word for a \"tent\" in Hebrew, and is so translated generally (Genesis 4:20; Genesis 9:21; 13:31; 18:1, etc.), though in this chapter, unfortunately, \"covering\" (ver. 7); andNEWLINENEWLINE3. A \"covering\" - mikseh, to be placed over the ohel, composed of rams' skins dyed red, and seals' skins (ver. 14). Subordinate parts of the structure were -NEWLINENEWLINE(a) The sockets, or bases, which were to receive and support the upright boards (vers. 19-25);NEWLINENEWLINE(b) The bars which were to hold the boards together (vers. 26-29);NEWLINENEWLINE(c) The veil, stretched on pillars, which was to be hung across the\" dwelling-house,\" and to separate it into two parts, the \"holy place\" and the \"holy of holies\" (vers. 31-33); andNEWLINENEWLINE(d) The curtain or \"hanging\" at the open end of the \"dwelling-place,\" where there were no boards, which was intended to close that side of the structure when necessary (vers. 36, 37). The fine linen covering (vers. 1-6). Verse 1. - Thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains. These \"ten curtains\" are explained in the verses which follow to be ten \"breadths,\" so fastened together as to form practically a single curtain or awning, which constituted the cieling or inner covering of the tabernacle. The mode of its arrangement is not quite certain. Some suppose that it was really a part of the \"tent,\" being laid over the same framework as the goats' hair curtain (Fergusson, Cook); others believe it to have been strained across the mishkan and fastened to the top of the boards on either side, thence depending, either inside or outside (Bahr, Keil). The former supposition appears the more probable. Fine twined linen is linen the threads of which are formed of several fine strands twisted together. This is often the case with Egyptian linen. On blue and purple and scarlet, see the comment upon Exodus 25:4. Cherubims of cunning work. Rather, \"cherubim, the work of a skilled weaver.\" Figures of cherubs were to be woven into the hangings in the loom itself, not embroidered upon them afterwards.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Eight and twenty cubits. This is the exact length required for a rectangular tented roof over such a space, which should descend (as tent roofs usually do) within about seven feet of the ground. The comparison made in vers. 12, 13, between the fine linen covering of the mishkan and the goats' hair covering of the \"tent,\" implies that the one was directly under the other, and that both were arranged in the same way. The breadth of four cubits. This gives for the entire length of the curtain (4 by 10), 40 cubits, or ten cubits more than the length of the boarded space. The roof must thus have been advanced some distance in front of the tabernacle proper, or rectangular boarded space. Every one of the curtains shall have one measure. They shall all, i.e., have the same measure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When the ten \"breadths\" had been woven, five were to be sewn together to form one portion of the awning, and the other five to form another portion, the reason for this being, probably, that if all the ten breadths had been sewn together, the awning would have been too cumbrous to have been readily folded together, or easily conveyed when the people journeyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Authorised Version gives the sense fairly. The two curtains, each composed of five \"breadths,\" were to be united by means of one hundred loops, fifty on each curtain, which were to be coupled together by fifty \"taches\" or clasps. The loops were to be of the \"blue\" material used generally in the textile fabrics of the tabernacle (Exodus 25:4; Exodus 26:1, 31, 36), and the \"taches\" or clasps were to be of gold. In this way the covering of the mishkan was to be completed. The goat's skin tent-cloth (vers. 7-13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - From the inner covering of the tabernacle the directions proceed to the external covering, or rather coverings, which constituted the real strength of the structure, and its protection from wet or stormy weather. Curtains of goats' hair, such as the Arabs still use, as the ordinary covering of their tents (Layard, Nin. and Bab., p. 171), were to form a true \"tent\" (ohel) above the tabernacle, being supported by tent-poles, and kept taut by means of cords and pegs (Exodus 27:19; Exodus 35:18). See the representation in Dr. W. Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 3. p. 1454, which is reproduced in the Speaker's Commentary, vol. 1. p. 376. To be a covering. In Exodus 36:14, we have - \"he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle,\" which is far better. The word used in both places is the same (ohel). Eleven curtains - i.e., \"eleven breadths.\" Compare ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The length... shall be thirty cubits. A tent with a rectangular roof, over such a chamber as the mishkan, brought down, as tents usually are, within six or seven feet of the ground, would have required a covering of this length. If the slope of the roof had been greater, the covering must have been longer. The breadth... four cubits. This gives for the entire covering, when made up, a width of forty-four cubits, or sixty-six feet. As the entire length of the mishkan was only thirty cubits, or forty-five feet, it is evident that the tent projected considerably beyond the tabernacle, either at both ends, or, at any rate, at one end. Probably the projection was at one end only - viz., in front; where it constituted a porch, eighteen or twenty feet deep. The temple, which was modelled after the tabernacle, had a porch fifteen feet deep.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Thou shalt couple, etc. As with the inner awning of linen, so with the goats' hair tent-cloth. The whole when made up was to be in two pieces, for convenience of transport. (See the comment on ver. 3.) The number of breadths in the tent-cloth being uneven, the two pieces were to be of different sizes, one containing five, and the other six, \"breadths.\" Thou shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle. \"Tabernacle\" here is a mistranslation; since the Hebrew word is ohel, \"tent.\" The meaning may be, either that the sixth breadth was to be doubled back upon the fifth, or that half of it was to be doubled back upon the other half. The latter view is to be preferred, since otherwise the extra breadth would have been superfluous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that coupleth the second. Rather, \"fifty loops at the edge of the second curtain of coupling.\" The two portions of the goats' hair covering were to be united in exactly the same way as those of the inner awning of linen. Fifty loops were to be sewn on to the edge of the extreme, or outermost, breadth of each portion, and these loops were to be connected by clasps or links. The outermost breadth on which the loops are sewn, is called the curtain of coupling.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Fifty taches of brass. Rather \"of bronze.\" The links of the inner curtain were of gold (ver. 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The remnant which remaineth, etc. Both this and the next verse presume a very close connection between the fine linen covering of the mishkan and the goats hair tent-cloth which protected it. \"The remnant that remaineth\" is the half-breadth by which the tent-cloth would overlap the linen covering at the back of the tent, when at the front half of the eleventh breadth had been turned back upon the other half (see comment on ver. 9). This \"remnant\" was to be 'allowed to hang down over the back part of the tabernacle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And a cubit. Rather, \"And the cubit.\" The cubit by which the goats' hair tent-cloth, which was thirty cubits across (ver. 8), would exceed the linen covering, which was twenty-eight cubits (ver. 2), on either side of the tabernacle, was to be allowed to hang down, like a valance, hiding so far the golden boards of the tabernacle. The outer protection (ver. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And thou shalt make a covering for the tent. Nothing is said of the size of this covering; but, as its object was clearly to protect the roof of the tent from penetration by wet, it seems reasonable to suppose that it extended at least as far as the boards of the tabernacle. To do this, it must have been thirty cubits long, and fourteen broad. The boarding of the tabernacle (vers. 15-30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Boards... of shittim wood. These boards were to be fifteen feet long by two feet three inches broad, and, if they were each of a single plank, can scarcely have been furnished by any of the acacias which now grow in the Sinaitic peninsula. It is possible, however, that they were made up of two or more planks, since the name by which they are designated, kereth, is thought to be applied in Ezekiel 27:6, to the \"deck of a ship.\" Standing up. The way in which they were to be made to \"stand up\" is explained in vers. 17 and 19. They were not to have one end sunk in the ground, but to be fitted by means of \"tenons\" into silver \"sockets.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTen cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTwo tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Two tenons. Literally, \"hands.\" Projecting rods, such as those common in our dinner tables, seem to be meant. They may have been of metal, let into the boards to a certain depth, and projecting several inches beyond them. Or, possibly, they may have been of acacia wood. In one board - i.e. \"In each board\" - no doubt, at the bottom of each. Set in order one against the other. Arranged, i.e., at regular intervals, the position of each corresponding to the position of its fellow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Twenty boards. Each board being a cubit and a half in width (ver. 16), the length of the chamber was, necessarily, thirty cubits. On the south side southward. Literally, \"On the south side, to the right.\" The Orientals regarded it as natural to look to the east, and spoke of the east as \"in front,\" the west as \"behind,\" the north as \"on the left,\" and the south as \"on the right hand.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Forty sockets of silver. Nothing is said of the shape of these \"sockets.\" They were certainly very massive, as each contained a silver talent (Exodus 38:27), and thus weighed from eighty to ninety pounds. It has been supposed that they stood on the ground, and formed a sort of continuous base, out of which the planks rose. But this would have constituted a very unsafe structure. Kalisch is probably right in his view, that the sockets were let into the ground resembling those at the bottom of a gate, into which the bolt is pressed down. Each socket received one of the \"tenons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The second side... the north side. The north side, or left hand, was always regarded as less honourable than the south side or right hand (see Genesis 48:13-20), probably because in the northern hemisphere the sun illumines the south side. It showed the superior dignity of the south side that the golden candlestick was set against it (Exodus 40:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six boards.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - For the sides of the tabernacle westward. Rather, \"for the back\" (τὰ ὀπίσω - LXX.). Here there were to be six boards only, which would give the abnormal and improbable width of nine cubits. The additional cubit required was no doubt obtained from the corner boards, or posts, each of which added to the (internal) width half a cubit (see ver. 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They shall be coupled together beneath... unto one ring. This is very obscure, and might be explained in several ways. Perhaps it is best to suppose that the coupling was by the \"bars,\" cf. vers. 26-29, the ends of which fitted into a sort of double ring, like the figure 8, attached to the corner posts. Above the head. Rather \"at\" or near the head.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And they shall be eight boards. Counting in the two comer boards, or posts, the boards of the back would be eight. Each of them was to have two \"tenons,\" like the boards of the sides, and every \"tenon\" was to have its own silver \"socket.\" Thus the \"sockets\" would be sixteen, two under each board.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-28. - Bars of shittim wood. To give greater stability to the structure, to keep the boards in their places, and to prevent there being any aperture between them, five bars were to be made for each side, and the same number for the end, of the mishkan, which were to be passed through rings attached to the boards - one at least to each - and thus to hold the boards firmly together. The middle bar in each case was to extend the whole length of the enclosure (ver. 28), and thus in two cases to be thirty cubits, or forty-five feet long. The exact length, and the disposition of the other bars is not indicated; but it is with reason conjectured that two were above and two below the \"middle bar\" that all were horizontal - and that each coupled together one half of the boards of each side. The length of each was probably fifteen cubits; and the ends which reached the two comer posts at the back ran into the corner rings, which were shaped so as to receive the two bars (see ver. 24). It is not said whether the bars were inside or outside the mishkan; but the best authorities suppose them to have been outside.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The rings were to be of solid gold; the boards and the bars of acacia wood overlaid with gold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - According to the fashion. Where the description was incomplete (and it could not but be incomplete in many points), Moses was to follow his recollection of the \"pattern,\" which either in vision, or otherwise - he had seen in the mount This would be his best guide, forNEWLINENEWLINE\"Segnius irritant animum demissa per aures,NEWLINEQuam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-35. - The veil and the ordering of the holy places.

The veil was to be of the same material and workmanship as the inner covering extended over the mishkan, and like that, was to have figures of cherubim woven into its texture by a skilled weaver.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Four pillars. The contrast between these four pillars of the interior, and the \"five pillars\" at \"the door of the tent\" (vers. 36, 37), is striking, and justifies the supposition that the veil in the tabernacle did not completely divide the holy of holies from the holy place, but formed a screen, above which the space was open. If the veil had been hung from the top of the tented roof, so as completely to separate the two places, there must have been fire pillars, or at any rate an odd number, m the interior. Their hooks shall be of gold. These are hooks attached to the pillars, for the purpose of their having the curtains hung upon them. Upon the four sockets. The word \"sockets\" has no article. Translate - \"Thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold, with their hooks of gold, and standing upon four sockets of silver.

If the \"taches\" of ver. 6 or even of ver. 11, are intended, and\" under\" is to be taken strictly as\" immediately under,\" the mishkan must have been divided by the veil into two equal, or very nearly equal parts; and the tabernacle must in an important particular have completely differed from the temple. In the temple the holy place was twice the length of the holy of holies (1 Kings 6:16, 17). It is possible that \"under \"may be used vaguely, or that the \"taches\" of this verse are the \"hooks\" of ver. 32. That thou mayest bring in. Rather, \"And thou shalt bring in.\" The clause is directive. The most holy. Literally, \"the holy of holies\" - the inner chamber, that within the veil, which constituted the adytum, or innermost recess of the tabernacle. The ark and the mercy-seat were the special furniture of this inner sanctuary. To these is added later (Exodus 30:1-10) the altar of incense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in the most holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus26:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on the north side.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The table here is, of course, \"the table of shew-bread\" described in the preceding chapter (vers. 23-30), immediately after the mercy-seat It was to be set \"without the veil,\" in the holy place or outer chamber, against the north wall. The candlestick is the seven-branched lamp-stand described in Exodus 25:31-39.

The central pillar was, no doubt, as Mr. Fergusson long ago pointed out, one of two tent-poles, which supported between them a ridge-pole, over which were thrown the coverings that formed the roof of the tent. Its height was probably fifteen cubits, so as to give a due slope to the roof. The two pillars nearest to the central one probably measured ten cubits, and stood in line with the two walls of the mishkan. The outer pair would then have a height of five cubits, and support the two extremities of the goats' hair covering. Their hooks. The hooks whereby the \"hanging\" was attached to the pillars.

From the description of the tabernacle, or sacred tent in which worship was to be offered by the priests, it followed in natural sequence, that directions should be given concerning the court, or precinct, within which the tabernacle was to stand Ancient temples were almost universally surrounded by precincts, which the Greeks called τεμένη, whereto a sacred character attached; and this was particularly the case in Egypt, where the temenos seems to have been a regular adjunct to the temple (Wilkinson in Rawlinson's Heradotus, vol. 2. p. 202, 2nd edition). Among the chief uses of such an open space, was the offering of victims on altars, as these could not be conveniently consumed elsewhere than in the open air, on account of the clouds of smoke and the fumes of the sacrifices. As in the description of the tabernacle, the furniture was first described, then the structure, so now the altar takes precedence of the court which was to contain it. Verse 1. - Thou shalt make an altar. Rather, \"the altar.\" God had already declared that he would have an altar made to him in the place where he should \"record his name\" (Exodus 20:24). And, even apart from this, an altar would be regarded as so essential an element in Divine worship, that no place of worship could be without one. Of shittim wood. God had required (1. s. c.) that his altar should be \"of earth,\" or else of unhewn stones (Exodus 20:25). The command now given was to make, not so much an altar, as an altar-case (see ver. 8). There can be no doubt that Jarchi is right in supposing that, whenever the tabernacle for a time became stationary, the hollow case of the altar was rifled up with earth, and that the victims were burnt upon this. Four-square. Altars were commonly either square or round. An Assyrian triangular one was found by Mr. Layard at Nineveh; but even this had a round top. The square shape is the most usual, and was preserved, probably in all the Temple altars, certainly in those of Solomon (2 Chronicles 4:1) and Herod (Joseph. Bell. Jud. 5:05, § 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The horns of it. Literally, \"its horns.\" Horns were not usual adjuncts of altars; indeed they seem to have been peculiar to those of the Israelites. They were projections at the four top comers, probably not unlike the horns of bulls, whence their name. Criminals clung to them when they took sanctuary (1 Kings 1:50; 1 Kings 2:28); and the blood of sin-offerings was smeared upon them (Exodus 29:12; Leviticus 8:15; Leviticus 9:9; Leviticus 16:18, etc.). Victims also were sometimes, when about to be sacrificed, bound to them (Psalm 118:27). According to Kalisch, \"The horns were symbolical of power, of protection and help; and at the same time of glory and salvation.\" His horns shall be of the same. Part and parcel of the altar, that is, not extraneous additions. Thou shalt overlay it with brass. A solid plating of bronze is no doubt intended, such as would protect the shittim wood and prevent it from being burnt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - His pans to receive his ashes. Literally, \"to cleanse it from fat' - i.e., to receive what remained after burning the victims, which would be ashes mixed with a good deal of fat. His shovels. Those would be used in removing the ashes from the altar, and depositing them in the pans. His basins. Vessels for receiving the blood of the victims and from which it was poured on the altar. Compare Exodus 24:6. His flesh hooks. So the Septuagint, and our translators again in 1 Samuel 2:13. They would seem by the latter passage to have been three-pronged forks, the proper use of which was, no doubt, to arrange the various pieces, into which the victim was cut, upon the altar. His fire-pans. The word used is generally translated \"censers\" (Leviticus 10:1; Leviticus 16:12; Numbers 4:14: 16:6, 17, etc.), but sometimes \"snuff-dishes\" (Exodus 25:38; Exodus 37:23). It here perhaps designates the vessels used for carrying burning embers from the altar of burnt-offering, to the altar of incense on certain occasions (Leviticus 16:12). Etymologically, it means simply \"a receptacle.\" All the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass. Rather, \"of bronze.\" Bronze was the usual material of utensils and implements in Egypt (Birch, Guide to British Museum, pp. 13-21; 28, 29; 35-41; etc.). Copper was scarcely used without the alloy of tin which converts it into bronze; and brass was wholly unknown. A trace of iron is sometimes found in Egyptian bronzeNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Thou shalt make for it a grate. Rather, \"a grating.\" This was probably a protection for the lower part of the altar, and prevented it from being touched by the feet of the ministrant priests. It was outside the altar, and had the rings attached to it, by which the altar was carried when the Israelites journeyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thou shalt put it under the compass. The \"compass\" (karkob) is spoken of as if it were something well-known; yet it had not been previously mentioned. Etymologically the word should mean \"a cincture\" or \"band\" round the altar; and thus far critics are generally agreed. But its position, size, and object, are greatly disputed. Some hold that it was a broad bench, or step, on which the officiating priests stood at the time of a sacrifice, and that its position was about the middle of the altar. Others think that it was a mere border round the top, from which the net-work depended, and that the object of both was to catch anything that might fall from the altar. Others again, while placing it mid-way in the altar, regard it as a mere ornament, only projecting slightly, and forming a sort of finish to the net-work. This, which is the view of Knobel, seems to be, on the whole, the most probable one. That the net may be even to the midst of the altar. If the\" compass\" was at the top, the net must have extended thence to the middle. If it was mid-way in the altar, the net must have covered the lower half. To us this latter seems the more probable view. But the point is uncertain.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Staves, or polos, were needed for the carriage of the altar from place to place, as for the ark (Exodus 25:13) and the table of shew-bread (ib, ver. 28). They were to be inserted into the rings mentioned in ver. 4. As the altar was of bronze, so the rings were to be of bronze, and the staves overlaid with bronze. There is a gradual descent in the preciousness of the materials from the holy of holies to the holy place, and from that to the court.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the mount, so shall they make it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Hollow with boards shalt thou make it.

The description of the altar is (as already observed) naturally followed by that of the court which was to contain it, and in which it was to be the most conspicuous object. This is given with great clearness in ten verses, and presents scarcely any problem for solution. The court was an oblong square, three hundred feet in length and seventy-five in breadth. It was enclosed by curtains, hung on sixty pillars, placed at intervals of seven feet and a half apart. The pillars were connected by rods, and each of them fitted into a socket. There was but one entrance, which was at the eastern side, midway in it. It was thirty feet wide, and had its own curtains and its own pillars. These curtains were of similar material with those at the entrance to the tabernacle, but the hangings round the rest of the court were merely of fine white linen. Verse 9. - Thou shalt make the court. Rather, \"a court.\" For the south side southward. Rather,\" For the south side, upon the right.\" Compare the comment on Exodus 26:18. Hangings. The word used is a rare one in this sense, quite different from those which have been employed for \"curtains\" or \"hangings \"previously (Exodus 26:1, 7, 36). The LXX. translate by ἱστία \"sails;\" and the Jewish commentators believe a loosely woven sail-cloth to be intended. Fine twined linen. See the comment on Exodus 26:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And the twenty pillars thereof, etc. Literally, \"And its pillars, twenty (in number), and their sockets, twenty (in number, shall be) of bronze.\" The hooks of the pillars are loops whereto the curtains were to be attached. See Exodus 26:32. Their fillets. It is now generally agreed that the word used designates \"connecting rods,\" which joined the pillars at the top, and probably helped to support the \"hangings.\" These, and the \"hooks,\" were of solid silver.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The north side of the court is to be exactly similar to the south in all respects.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The west side is also to be similar, except that it is to be half the length, fifty cubits - and, therefore, requires only half the number of pillars and sockets.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be fifty cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The breadth of the court on the east side eastward.

Hence, they said, the four cardinal points received the names of kedem, \"in front\" (the east); yamin, \"the right hand\" (the south); akhor, \"behind\" (the west); and shemol, \"the left hand\" (the north).

The word used is the common one for \"gate;\" but here it rather signifies \"entrance.\" Strictly speaking, there was no \"gate;\" the worshippers entered by drawing aside the curtain. This was a hanging of similar material, colours, and workmanship to that which hung in front of the tabernacle (Exodus 26:36). By its contrast with the white linen screen which surrounded the rest of the court, it would show very clearly where men were to enter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Filleted with silver.

What this verse adds is the height of the pillars, which was five cubits, or seven feet six inches.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 27:19NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - THE VESSELS OF THE TABERNACLE. There were many \"vessels of the tabernacle\" which have not hitherto been mentioned, as the great laver in the court (Exodus 30:18; Exodus 40:30) with the basins for washing which must have belonged to it; the pins or pegs whereby the various curtains were extended and supported; and probably much sacrificial apparatus besides what is enumerated in ver. 3. All these were to be of bronze, the commonest metal of the time, but one very suitable for the various purposes, being, as the Egyptians manufactured it, of great hardness, yet exceedingly ductile and ready to take all shapes. Its usefulness and convenience caused it to retain its place, even in the gorgeous and \"magnificent\" temple of Solomon (1 Chronicles 29:2, 7), where it was employed for the two great pillars, Jachin and Boaz, for the great laver or \"brazen sea,\" for the mailer layers upon wheels, for the pots, the shovels, the basins, the snuffers, the spoons, and many other sacred vessels (1 Kings 7:15-45; 2 Kings 25:13, 14). Though \"common,\" it was never reckoned \"unclean,\" or less fitted for the service of the sanctuary than silver or gold. It had, however, its own proper place, an inferior place to that held by the more precious metals. Verse 19. - All the pins thereof. The \"pins\" of the tabernacle are undoubtedly the pegs or tent-pins, whereby the tent-cloth wherewith it was covered was extended and kept taut. There were also probably similar pegs or pins for cords used to keep the \"pillars\" (Exodus 26:37) or tent-poles in place. The pins of the court supported in the same way the pillars of the court (vers. 10-15).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 27:20-21NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - THE OIL FOR THE LAMP. It has been observed that this paragraph is somewhat out of place. It would more appro priately, according to human ideas, have terminated ch. 25. But \"God's ways are not as man's ways, nor his thoughts as man's thoughts.\" It is frequently difficult - some-times impossible - for the keenest human intellect to trace the connecting links between one portion of God's word and the next. In such cases it is best not to speculate on the nature of the connection, but to content ourselves with laying to heart the lesson which each portion teaches separately. Verse 20. - Thou shalt command. Compare Exodus 25:6, where the general command had been given. Here certain additions are made as to the quality of the oil which was to be brought. The oil was to be pure olive oil beaten that is to say, it was to be olive oil purified from any admixture of that watery juice which the Romans called amurca; and it was to be of the kind which is obtained by mere beating or pounding in a mortar, and not by crushing in a mill. Oil of this kind, which is usually made from the unripe fruit, is reckoned much the best; it is clear and colourless, and gives a bright pure light with little smoke. To cause the lamp to burn always. It has been supposed from this expression that the lamp must have been kept constantly burning both day and night; and Josephus declares that this was actually so, at least with three out of the seven lights (Ant. Jud. 3:7, 7). But there are several places m Scripture which state, or imply, the contrary. (See especially Exodus 30:8; and 1 Samuel 3:3.) It seems to have been the duty of the high-priest to light the lamps every evening, and to give them a sufficient supply of oil to last till daybreak, at which time \"the lamp of God went out\" (1 Samuel l.s.c.) The supposition that \"one light at least was always burning\" (Kalisch), because no daylight could penetrate into the structure through the fourfold covering, ignores the fact that light would enter through the single curtain at the entrance, as well as the probability that some portion of that curtain may generally have been looped up. If we regard the lamp as extinguished during the daytime, we must understand \"always\" here to mean \"regularly every night.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. The tabernacle of the congregation. Rather, \"the tent of meeting\" - the tent where God would meet the earthly ruler of the people (Exodus 25:22), and give him commands and directions - not the place of meeting for the people themselves, who might in no case go beyond the entrance to the structure. The testimony - i,e., the ark which contained the \"testimony,\" or two tables of stone written with the finger of God. Aaron and his sons. Compare Exodus 24:1. The intention to confer the priesthood on the descendants of Aaron, first openly revealed in the next chapter (vers. 1-43), is tacitly assumed from time to time in the earlier narrative. Shall order it from evening to morning. See the comment on ver. 20. It is difficult to assign these words any distinct meaning unless we accept the view, that the lamp burnt during the night only. It shall be a statute for ever. This expression is not at all common. In Exodus it occurs only here and in four other places. In Leviticus it is met with some six or seven times. The portions of the law thus characterised must be regarded as of special importance. (See the homiletics on this verse.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-12. - THE HOLY GARMENTS. The special object of the present chapter is to prescribe the form, materials, colour, etc., of the holy garments - or the attire of those who were to minister in the tabernacle at the time of their ministration. As the service of the tabernacle was about to be committed to Aaron and his sons, their selection for this office is mentioned in verse 1, and their investiture and consecration briefly touched in verse 41. Otherwise the whole chapter is concerned with the attire That of Aaron is first prescribed (vers. 4-39). It consists of an ephod (vers. 6-12); a breastplate (vers. 13-30); a robe (vers. 31-35); a mitre (vers 36-38); a coat, or tunic; and a girdle (ver. 39). The dress of his sons follows. It comprises drawers (ver. 42), tunics, girdles, and caps or turbans (ver. 40). Incidentally it is mentioned in verse 43, that drawers are also to be worn by Aaron; and, in conclusion, the neglect of this ordinance in the case of either Aaron or his sons is forbidden under penalty of death Verse 1. - Take thou unto thee. Literally, \"Make to draw near to thee.\" Moses had hitherto been of all the people the one nearest to God, the medium of communication. He was now to abdicate a portion of his functions, transferring them to his brother and his brother's sons. By this act he would draw them nearer to him than they were before. It is worthy of remark that he makes no remonstrance or opposition, but carries out God's will in this matter as readily and willingly as in all others. (See Leviticus 8:4-30.) From among the children of Israel. The LXX. reads \"And from among the children of Israel,\" as if others besides the family of Aaron had been admitted to the priesthood. But this is contrary to the entire tenor of the later narrative. The existing Hebrew text is correct. Nadab and Abihu, and again, Eleazar and Ithamar, are always coupled together in the Pentateuch (Exodus 24:1; Leviticus 10:1, 12; etc.), while a marked division is made between the two pairs of brothers. It is probably the sin and early death of the two elder (Leviticus 10:1-2) that causes the separation. Of Ithamar after the death of his brothers, nothing is known. Eleazar became high priest (Numbers 34:17; Joshua 14:1; Joshua 17:4; etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and for beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Holy garments have provoked an extreme aversion and an extreme affection at different periods of the world's history. In Moses' time probably no one thought of raising any objection to them. Priestly dresses of many different kinds were worn in Egypt, and some costume other than that of ordinary life, was probably affected by the priest class of every nation. Without entering into any elaborate \"philosophy of clothes,\" we may say that the rationale of the matter would seem to be that expressed with great moderation by Richard Hooker - \"To solemn actions of royalty and justice their suitable ornaments are a beauty. Are they in religion only a stain?\" (See Eccl. Pol. 5:29, § 1.) The garments ordered to be made for Aaron and his sons (ver. 41), are said to have been for glory and for beauty.NEWLINENEWLINE1. \"For glory.\" To exalt the priestly office in the eyes of the people - to make them look with greater reverence on the priests themselves and the priestly functions - to place the priests in a class by themselves, in a certain sense, above the rest of the nation.NEWLINENEWLINE2. \"For beauty.\" As fit and comely in themselves - suitable to the functions which the priests exercised - in harmony with the richness and beauty of the sanctuary wherein they were to minister. God, himself, it would seem, is not indifferent to beauty. He has spread beauty over the earth, fie will have beauty in his earthly dwelling-place. He requires men to worship him \"in the beauty of holiness\" (Psalm 29:2; Psalm 96:9; 1 Chronicles 16:29). He ordains for his priests rich and splendid dresses \"for glory and for beauty.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Wise-hearted. In modern parlance the heart is made the seat of the affections and emotions, the brain of the intellect. But the Hebrew idiom was different. There the heart was constantly spoken of as the seat of wisdom. (See below, Exodus 31:6; Exodus 35:10, 25; Exodus 36:1, 2; Job 9:4; Proverbs 11:29, etc.) The spirit of wisdom might seem to be scarcely necessary for the work of constructing a set of priestly garments; but where \"glory and beauty\" are required, high artistic power is needed; and this power is regarded by the sacred writers, as indeed it is by most of those who have written on the human understanding - notably Plato and Aristotle - as a very important part of the intellect. Techne, says Aristotle, involves theoria, as well as aesthesis and genesis, requires, i.e., a knowledge of high abstract truths, as well as the perceptive faculty which we commonly call \"taste,\" and the constructive one known as \"power of execution.\" (See Eth. Nic. 6:4, § 4.) It is, with him, one of the five chief intellectual excellences. To consecrate him. Investiture in the holy garments was made a part of the ceremony of consecration (Exodus 29:5-9; Leviticus 8:7-9, 13), as it is in the English Ordinal in the consecration of a bishop.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - These are the garments. The enumeration does not follow the same order exactly as the description. The two agree, however, in giving the precedence to the same three articles of apparel out of the six - viz., the breast-plate, the ephod, and the robe. His sons - i.e., his successors in the office of high priest, The materials of the priestly garments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The materials for the priestly garments were to be limited to six - precious stones, which are not here mentioned, as being ornamental, rather than essential, parts of the apparel; a blue thread, known as \"blue\" (compare Exodus 25:4); a purple or crimson one, known as \"purple;\" a scarlet one, known as \"scarlet;\" and a white one, which is called \"fine linen.\" These were the same materials as those used for the veil (Exodus 26:31), and curtains (ib, 1, 36) of the sanctuary; but probably the fabric was of a more delicate quality. They shall take - i.e.,\" They,\" the wise-hearted men to whom the work was to be entrusted - \"shall take,\" or receive from Moses - \"the (necessary) gold, blue, purple,\" etc. In the original all these words have the definite article prefixed. The Ephod,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They shall make the ephod The word ephod signifies etymologically any \"vestment\" or \"garment;\" but in its use it is confined to the special vestment here described, the great object of which was to be a receptacle for the \"breast-plate.\" The ephod was a sort of jerkin or waistcoat, consisting of two pieces, one to cover the chest and the other the back, joined together probably by a seam, above the shoulders, and united at the waist by a band called \"the curious girdle of the ephod.\" This band was of one piece with the ephod, being woven on either to the front or the back part; it held the other part in place, and was passed round the body and fastened either with a clasp, or with buttons, or strings. Of gold, of blue, of purple, etc. - i.e., \"of the same materials as the curtains and veil of the sanctuary, with the addition of gold.\" The gold was probably in the shape of gold thread, or wire of extreme tenuity, and was introduced by the needle after the fabric bad been woven, as was commonly done in Egypt (Herod. 3:47; Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, vol. 3. p. 128: compare below, Exodus 39:3). The white, blue, purple, and scarlet threads were doubtless woven into a pattern of some kind; but it is impossible to say what the pattern was. In Egypt patterns were not much affected, the dress worn being commonly white, with a stripe sometimes at the edge; but the Semitic tribes, who bordered Egypt on the East, affected gay colours and. varied designs, if we may trust the Egyptian wall-paintings. With cunning work. Literally, \"work of the skilled (workman).\" Some of the Hebrews had evidently carried on the trade of weaving in Egypt, and had brought their looms with them. The Egyptian looms were hand-looms, and of no great size; they admitted of easy transport.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The two shoulder-pieces thereof, Literally, \"Two shoulder-pieces.\" There is no article, and no possessive pronoun.

Female dresses were made in this way among the Greeks, but fastened with a brooch or buckle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The curious girdle. Josephus says of the ephod, ζώνῃ περισφίγγεται βάμμασι διαπεποικιλμένῃ χρυσοῦ συνυφασμένου, \"it is fastened with a girdle dyed of many hues, with gold interwoven in it.\" Hence its name, khesheb, which means properly \"device\" or \"cunning work.\" Of the ephod. Rather \"of its girding\" - i.e. \"wherewith it (the ephod) was to be girded.\" Shall be of the same. Compare above, Exodus 25:19. The girdle was to be \"of one piece\" with the ephod, woven on to it as part of it, not a separate piece attached by sewing. According to the work thereof. Rather, \"of like workmanship with it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of the children of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Two onyx stones. The correctness of this rendering has been much disputed. The LXX. give σμάραγδος, \"emeraid.\" as the Greek equivalent in the present passage, while many argue for the beryl (Winer, Rosenmuller, Bollermann), and others for the sardonyx. This last rendering has the support of Josephus and Aquila. The sardonyx is, in fact, nothing but the best kind of onyx, differing from the onyx by having three layers - black, white, and red - instead of two - black and white - only. When large, it fetches a high price, as much as a thousand pounds having been asked for one by a dealer recently. The probability is, that it is the stone here intended. It is an excellent material for engraving. With respect to the possibility of Moses having in the congregation persons who could engrave the sardonyx, we may remark that the Egyptians cut stones quite as hard, from a date long anterior to the exodus. Grave on them the names of the children of Israel. Egyptian names are frequently found engraved on rings and amulets in hard stone; these rings and amulets date from the time of the twelfth dynasty. The names here intended are evidently the Israelite tribe names, which are reckoned as twelve, the double tribe of Joseph counting as one only.

Rather, \"an artificer.\" The engravings of a signet. Signets in Egypt were ordinarily rings, on the bezel of which the name of the owner was inscribed. Some were of solid gold; others with cylindrical bezels of glass or hard stone. On the early use of such signet rings in Egypt see Genesis 41:42. Cylinders, strung round the wrist and engraved with a name and titles, were common in Mesopotamia from B.C. 2000. Ouches of gold. Settings in open-work or filagree seem to be intended - a kind of setting which is very common in Egyptian ornaments.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Stones of memorial unto the children of Israel. Rather \"for the children of Israel\" - stones, i.e. which should serve to remind God that the high priest represented the twelve tribes, officiated in their name, and pleaded on their behalf.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 28:13-30NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make ouches of gold;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-30. - THE BREAST-PLATE. It has been noticed that the ephod had for its main object or purpose to be a receptacle for the breast-plate which was attached to it after it had been put on, and formed its principal ornament. The Hebrew word khoshen, which is translated \"breast-plate,\" means \"ornament;\" and the khoshen must certainly have been the most striking and brilliant object in the whole attire of the high priest. Externally, it did but repeat the symbolism of the ephod, exhibiting the high priest as the representative of the twelve tribes, whose names were engraved upon its twelve stones, as well as upon the onyxes of the ephod. Internally, it had, however, another, and a deeper import. It contained within it the Urim and the Thummim (ver. 30), by means of which God was consulted, and signified his will to his people. This must be regarded as its main end and use. It was from the decisions thus given that it received the name of \"the breastplate (or ornament) of judgment.\" Verse 13. - Ouches of gold. \"Buttons\" according to one view (Cook): \"sockets,\" according to another (Kalisch): \"rosettes,\" according to a third (Keil). Some small ornament of open-work (see the comment on ver. 11), which could be sewn on to the ephod, and whereto a chain might be attached, seems to be intended. The object was to fasten the \"breast-plate\" firmly to the ephod.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - At the ends. The meaning of the Hebrew word migaloth is very doubtful. Jarchi and Rosemuller approve of the rendering of our translators. Geddes, Boothroyd, and Dathe render \"chains of equal length.\" Gesenius, Kalisch, Canon Cook, and others, believe the true meaning to be \"wreathed,\" or \"of wreathen work,\" so that the next clause, \"after the manner of a rope,\" would be simply exegetic. Of wreathen work. Literally, \"after the manner of a rope.\" Cords of twisted gold wire were frequently used, instead of chains, by the Egyptians.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The breast-plate. As the khoshen was to be worn upon the breast (ver. 29), this name is appropriate; but it is not a translation of khoshen. Of judgment. See the introductory paragraph to this section. Kalisch translates \"the breast-plate of decision.\" It was to be made, so far as its main fabric was concerned, of exactly the same materials as the ephod. See ver. 6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFoursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Four square... being doubled. It has been generally supposed that the doubling was merely for the purpose of giving additional strength to the work, which was to receive twelve heavy gems; but Gesenius and others are of opinion that the object was to form a bag, in which the Urim and Thum-mira, which they regard as material objects, might be kept. A span. Half a cubit, or about nine inches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Settings of stones. These were similar to those of the two shoulder stones - i.e. of filagree or cloisonne work - as appears from Exodus 39:13. The first row of the stones is said to have been composed of a sardius, or sard, a topaz, and a carbuncle. Of these names the first only would seem to be tolerably certain. The second cannot be right, since the topaz was too hard a stone to be engraved by the ancient engravers. We may conjecture that the chrysolite, a pale stone not unlike the topaz, but far less hard, was the Genesis intended. The \"carbuncle\" is also thought to be wrong; and the \"beryl\" is suggested by some; by others \"a sort of precious corundum.\" Emerald, to which the \"smaragdus\" of the LXX. and Josephus would seem to point, cannot be right, since that stone is fully as hard as the topaz.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The second row an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. Here all the names must be wrong, for none of these three stones could be cut by the ancient engravers. Probably, carbuncle (or garnet), lapis lazuli, and onyx are intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. The term \"ligure\" is unknown in modern mineralogy; and it is to the last degree uncertain what stone the ancients intended by their lingurium or lapis ligurius Some think that \"jacinth,\" others that \"tourmaline,\" is the stone here meant. A few suggest amber, but amber cannot receive an engraving. \"Agate\" and \"amethyst\" are generally allowed to be right translations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their inclosings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper. If the identifications above suggested are allowed, two at least of these translations must be rejected. We have supposed the third stone in the first row to have been the \"beryl,\" and the third in the second the \"onyx.\" Perhaps we should translate, \"a turquoise, a sardonyx, and a jasper.\" (See the comment on ver. 9.)

They describe very minutely, and with some tautology, the mode in which the breast-plate was to be fastened to the ephod. It was to have four rings, two at its two upper corners (ver. 23), and two just behind its two lower corners (ver. 20); a gold twist or cord was to be passed through each of the two upper rings, and then attached to the\" ouches\" or settings of the shoulder stones (ver. 25; compare vers. 11-14). A blue lace or ribbon was to be passed through each of the two lower rings, and these laces were to be tied to two rings, sewn for the purpose on to the front of the ephod a little above the \"curious girdle\" (vers. 26, 27). By these four fastenings at its four corners, the breast-plate was securely attached to the ephod, and could not readily get loose from it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the side of the ephod inward.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Over against the other coupling thereof. Rather, \"near its joining.\" The \"joining\" of the ephod is perhaps the place where the 'curious girdle\" was woven on to it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And Aaron shall bear, etc. \"Aaron,\" i.e., \"shall not only bear the names of the twelve tribes upon his shoulders (ver. 12), but also upon his heart.\" He shall thus make a double presentation of them to God continually. The explanation is somewhat fanciful, that the names on the shoulder-stones indicated that the people were a burthen to him, while those on the stones of the breast-plate, being upon his breast, indicated that he bore them affection. The breast and the shoulder were probably chosen as being conspicuous and honourable positions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Thou shalt put in the breast-plate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim. The words Urim and Thummim mean respectively \"Lights \"and\" Perfections,\" or perhaps \"Light\" and \"Perfection - the plural form being merely a plural of honour. They were well translated by Aquila and Symmachus, φωτισμοὶ καὶ τελειότητες: less well by the LXX. ἡ δήλωσις καὶ ἡ ἀλήθεια: still worse by the Vulgate, Doctrina et Veritas. What exactly the two words represented is doubtful in the extreme. It has been supposed by some that they were not material objects, but a method by which God communicated his will; e.g., a miraculous light, or a miraculous voice. But such things as these could not have been put by Moses either \"in,\" or \"on the breastplate of judgment.\" Modern critics are generally agreed that the Urim and Thummim must have been material objects of one kind or another. The objects suggested are -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The engraved stones of the breast-plate.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Two small images, like the teraphim.NEWLINENEWLINE3. A gold plate, engraved with the name of Jehovah.NEWLINENEWLINE4. Three plates or slips; one blank, one engraved with \"yes,\" and one with \"no.\"NEWLINENEWLINE5. Diamonds, cut and uncut, with marks engraved on them.NEWLINENEWLINEAgainst the first of these views it is urged with very great force that the present passage shows the Urim and Thummim to be something quite distinct from the breast-plate - something which was to be added to the breast-plate after all the stones had been set in it; and which Aaron was to bear upon his breast in addition to the breast-plate and its jewels (compare ver. 29 with ver. 30). Against the fourth and fifth, it is sufficient to observe that they are pure conjectures, without any basis of authority, either in Scripture or tradition. The second and the third remain. The third has important Jewish names in its favour, but is open to the objection that it makes a single object correspond to both words. The second alone seems to have any basis in Scripture, which certainly connects the use of teraphim with the use of an ephod (Judges 17:5; Judges 18:14, 17, 20; Hosea 3:4). On the whole, while admitting that there is no sufficient evidence to determine the question, we incline to regard the Urim and Thummim as small images, kept in the bag of the \"breast-plate\" (ver. 16), by means of which the high priest gave a decision when he was consulted. How the decision was arrived at, is an even more difficult problem than the one which we have attempted to solve. Some suppose the two images to have been used as lots, one giving an affirmative and the other a negative answer. Others imagine, that by gazing attentively upon them, and fixing his thoughts on the qualities which they symbolised - illumination and perfection - the high priest was thrown into an ecstatic state which enabled him to prophesy aright. The notion has even been started, that an angel spoke by their lips, and answered any question that was put to them. The truth seems to be that no theory on the subject can be more than a theory - quite arbitrary and conjectural - neither Scripture nor tradition furnishing any hint on the matter. If we knew how men divined from teraphim (2 Kings 23:24; Ezekiel 21:21; Zechariah 10:2), we might thence obtain some inkling of the truth, since there is much probability in the view, that the teraphim were employed as an unauthorised substitute for the Urim and Thummim. (See Judges 17:5; Judges 18:5, 6, 14-20.) But the method of this divination is wholly unknown. It is not however likely to have been a mere casting of lots, which is a very simple process, and requires no images; nor can this explanation of the decision by Urim and Thummim be regarded as having probability m its favour. Perhaps, of all the theories, that which supposes the Urim and Thummim to have been objects gazed at by the high priest until he entered the ecstatic state, is the least objectionable. It must not, however, be considered an essential part of this theory, that the material objects were derived from the religion of Egypt (Plumptre). The objects must have been well known to Moses and to those for whom he wrote; otherwise, they could not have been introduced, without any account of their nature, as,\" The Urim\" and \"The Thummim.\" They had probably been long possessed and consulted by the nation, which was accustomed to believe that it received enlightenment from them. Perhaps they were a sort of teraphim, but unconnected with any idolatrous worship. It is quite conceivable that an old usage, hitherto un-authorised, but not debased by any flagrant corruption, should have been adopted by Divine command into the Mosaic ritual, purified of any evil that attached to it, and consecrated to an important purpose.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 28:31-35NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-35. - THE ROBE OF THE EPHOD. Underneath the ephod and breast-plate the high priest was to wear a robe, or frock, wholly of blue. This robe was to have a hole for the head at the top, and was to be woven without seam (Exodus 39:22). It was put on over the head, like a habergeon or coat of mail, and probably reached below the knee. Josephus says that it had no sleeves. Verse 31. - All of blue. This plainness and uniformity offered a strong contrast to the variegated hues of the breast-plate and ephod, and threw those portions of the attire into greater prominence. If the blue used was indigo, the effect of the contrast must have been heightenedNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - An hole in the top of it. A mere circular hole for the head to go through, unaccompanied by a slit or longitudinal opening. In the midst of it. Midway between the two arm-holes. A binding of woven work round about the hole of it. This would strengthen the edge of the opening) and prevent it from tearing or fraying. The binding was probably sewn on after the frock was woven. As it were the hole of an habergeon. Linen corselets or habergeons have been found in Egypt. They were sometimes covered with metal scales, and were of the make here indicated. (See the author's History of Egypt, vol. 1. p. 446.) The word here used for \"habergeon\" (takharah) is Egyptian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Upon the hem of it. Literally \"at its edge\" Pomegranates. Tassels in the shape of pomegranates, of three colours, seem to be intended. An ornament of the kind is common in Assyria, but not in Egypt. Bells of gold between them. The bell is not often found in Egypt, and seems certainly not to have born in common use there. It was, however. often hung round the necks of horses in Assyria (Ancient Monarchies, vol. it. pp. 8, 14, 15, 27), and is so simple an object that its invention was probably very early. The Assyrian bells are shaped almost exactly like our own. as are the classical ones.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34, 35. - A golden bell and a pomegranate. Hebrew tradition gives a most uncertain sound with respect to the number of the bells. According to some, they were 12 only; according to others, 72; according to a third school, 3651 Equally conflicting are the explanations given of their symbolism -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) that they typified the proclamation and expounding of the law by the high-priest -NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that they were a musical offering of praise -NEWLINENEWLINE(3) that they marked kingly dignity, since Oriental kings sometimes wore bells - andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) that they were a call to vigilance and attention. This last view is supported by the words of verse 35 - it shall be upon Aaron to minister, and his sound shall be hoard, or \"that its sound may be heard.\" The bells were a means of uniting priest and people in one common service - they enabled the people to enter into and second what the priest was doing for them, and so to render his mediation efficacious - they made the people's worship in the court of the sanctuary a \"reasonable service.\" And hence the threat, which certainly does not extend to all the priestly garments, implied in the words, \"that he die not.\" If the high priest neglected to wear the robe with the bells, he separated himself off from the people; made himself their substitute and not their mouthpiece; reduced their worship to a drear formality; deprived it of all heartiness and life and vigour. For thus abusing his office, he would deserve death, especially as he could not do it unwittingly, for his ears would tell him whether he was wearing the bells or not.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 28:36-38NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36-38. - THE MITRE. Josephus tells us that the head-dress of the high priest was \"not a conical cap, but a sort of crown, made of thick linen swathes\" (Ant. Jud. 3:7, § 3). It was thus really a species of turban. The colour was white; and the only ornament on it was the gold plate, with its blue ribbon or fillet. Verse 36. - Thou shalt make a plate of pure gold. The plate, though a mere ornament of the mitre, was, at once, its most conspicuous and its most significant feature. Placed directly in front, right over the forehead, and probably of burnished gold, it would attract universal attention, and catch the eye even more than the breast-plate. Its position made it \"the culminating point of the whole priestly attire\" (Kalisch) - and its inscription gave to that position extraordinary force and significance. For it taught that \"holiness to the Lord\" is the very highest crown and truest excellence of religion - that to which all ceremonial is meant to conduce - that without which all the paraphernalia of worship must ever be in God's sight a mockery. It set this truth conspicuously before the eyes, and was apt to impress it upon the hearts of all. It taught the high priest himself not to rest upon outward forms, but to aim in his own person, and teach the people to aim continually, at internal holiness. The extreme importance of this, causes the putting forward at once of the plate and its inscription before any account of the \"mitre\" is given.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Thou shalt put it on a blue lace. In Exodus 39:31, it is explained that the blue lace, or ribbon, was \"tied to it,\" probably at either end. That it may be upon the mitre - i.e., \"that it may be kept in place, and not slip from its position on the mitre.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - It shall be upon his forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the sacred things. Imperfection attaches to everything that man does; and even the sacrifices that the people offered to God required to be atoned for and purified. It was granted to the high priest in his official capacity to make the necessary atonement, and so render the people's gifts acceptable. For this purpose he was invested with an official holiness, proclaimed by the inscription upon the plate, which exhibited him as the type and representative of that perfectly Holy One, through whom alone can any real atonement be made to the Father. It shall be always upon his forehead - i.e., whenever he ministers.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 28:39NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - THE TUNIC AND GIRDLE. From the outer garments, which were the most important and distinctive, a transition is now made to the inner ones, in which there was nothing very remarkable. The linen drawers are for the present omitted, as not peculiar to the high priest. Directions are given for the tunic and the girdle. The former is to be woven in some peculiar way - so as to be diapered, as some think - and the latter is to be \"the work of the embroiderer.\" Verse 39. - Thou shalt embroider. This is certainly not the meaning of the Hebrew. Some peculiar mode of weaving the coat is intended. The coat. Rather, \"the tunic\" or \"shirt.\" The keloneth was a long linen gown or cassock, worn immediately over the drawers. It reached to the feet, and had tightly-fitting sleeves (Joseph. Ant. Jud. 3:7, § 2). Whether it showed beneath the \"robe of the ephod,\" or not, is uncertain; but the sleeves must certainly have been visible. The keloneth was white. Thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen. This direction had not been previously given. It is a little out of place. Thou shalt make the girdle of needlework. Literally, \"of the work of the embroiderer.\" The girdle was worn directly over the linen shirt, and under \"the robe of the ephod.\" It would seem that it was not seen at all, unless its ends hung down below \"the robe of the ephod.\" It was however to be artistically embroidered (See Exodus 39:29.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 28:40-43NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 40-43. - THE APPAREL OF THE ORDINARY PRIESTS. The chapter concludes with brief directions concerning the official attire of the ordinary priests. This was to consist of linen drawers like those of the high priest; of a tunic, also of linen (Exodus 39:27), shaped like his, but not diapered; of a linen girdle, the exact character of which is not stated; and of a close-fitting cap. The entire dress, with perhaps the exception of the girdle, was white. The linen drawers were regarded as of primary necessity, and the priest who did not wear them was threatened with death. Verse 40. - For Aaron's sons. His actual sons at this time - his descendants afterwards, to whom the priesthood was rigidly confined. Thou shalt make coats. The verb is different from that used in ver 39, and seems to imply that the priests' tunics were not to be patterned. Girdles. It has generally been supposed that these were of the same material and workmanship as the high priest's; but this is nowhere stated. In Exodus 39:29, the high priest's girdle alone is spoken cf. Bonnets. Certainly not \"bonnets \"in the modern sense. Plain, close-fitting caps, shaped like a cup, or rather basin, seem to be meant. Such caps were often worn in Egypt, but not by the priests. For glory and for beauty. See above, ver. 2. It is very noticeable, that the extremely simple attire of the ordinary priests - a dress of pure white, without anything ornamental about it, unless it were the girdle - is still regarded as sufficient \"for glory and for beauty.\" White robes have certainly a vast amount of scriptural testimony in their favour (Leviticus 16:4; Mark 9:3; John 20:12; Acts 1:10; Revelation 4:4; Revelation 6:11; Revelation 7:9, 14, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, etc. These words serve to connect the present chapter with the following one. They contain the first intimation that Moses is not only to cause the holy garments to be made, but to invest the priests in them, and further to consecrate both Aaron and his sons by anointing. On this point, see the comment on Exodus 29:7-9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Linen breeches. Rather, \"linen drawers\" (Kalisch), such as we see worn by the Egyptians generally, reaching from the waist to a little above the knee. (See Wilkinson in Rawlinson's Herodotus, vol. 2. p. 113, 2nd ed.) This also was of linen (Herod. 2:83). Unto the thighs - i.e., to the bottom of the thighs where they adjoin on the knee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus28:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation. Literally,\" when they go into the tent of meeting - i.e., the place where God and the high priest were to meet. The holy place. The \"holy place\" seems in this passage to include the court of the tabernacle, wherein the altar was situated. That they bear not iniquity. To \"bear iniquity\" is to incur guilt, or have sin imputed to one. If even through forgetfulness a priest entered the sanctuary without this necessary article of clothing, and so risked an unseemly, exposure of his person, he was to be accounted guilty, and punished by death. This was to be a \"statute for ever,\" and to apply both to the high priest and the ordinary priests. Compare Exodus 20:26.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.29":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-37. - THE CONSECRATION OF THE PRIESTS. From the description of the priestly attire, the Divine Law-giver passed to the form of priestly consecration, whereof investiture in the \"holy garments\" was a part. The ceremony of consecration was to consist of four things: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Ablution;NEWLINENEWLINE2. Investiture;NEWLINENEWLINE3. Chrism or Anointing with oil; andNEWLINENEWLINE4. Sacrifice.NEWLINENEWLINEIn the directions given, we have, first, the preparation of the offerings (vers. 1-3); secondly, directions for the ablutions (ver. 4); thirdly, directions for the investiture of Aaron (vers. 5, 6), of his sons (vers. 8, 9); fourthly, directions for the anointing (ver. 7); and fifthly, directions as to the mode in which the sacrifices should be offered and disposed of (vers. 10-34). A command is then given that the ceremonies should be repeated every day for a week (ver. 35); and another, that the altar should receive consecration at the same time as the priests (vers. 36, 37). Additional light is thrown on most of these matters by the account contained in Leviticus (ch. 8.), of the manner in which Moses carried oat the directions here given to him. Verse 1. - This is the thing that thou shalt do to them - i.e., \"This is the ceremonial that thou shalt use on the occasion.\" There is a tacit reference to verse 41 of ch. 28, which had announced that the priests were to be consecrated. Take one young bullock. The offerings were to be provided beforehand, so as to be in readiness when the investiture and anointing were over. Hence they are mentioned first. Rams without blemish. Literally \"perfect.\" On the offence to God of offering him blemished offerings, see Malachi 1:6-14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2 - Unleavened bread was regarded as purer than leavened, since fermentation is a sort of corruption.

Literally, \"mixed with oil,\" i.e., having oil as one of their ingredients, in contrast with the wafers, which had oil poured over them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou shalt bring them in the basket. Rather, \"Thou shalt offer them.\" A preliminary offering of the animals and of the \"meat-offerings,\" in the lump seems to be intended. This, apparently, preceded the ablution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Ablution. Verse 4. - Unto the door of the tabernacle. The great laver was to be placed between the entrance to the tabernacle and the altar of burnt-offering (Exodus 30:18). It was to this probably that Aaron and his sons were to be brought. Its main purpose was to be a lustral vessel, placed ready for the various ablutions which the law required (ib, 19-21). Thou .... shalt wash them with water. Ablutions were an important part of the ceremonial of almost all ancient religions. In Egypt, the priests were compelled to wash themselves from head to foot in cold water twice every day, and twice every night (Herod. 2:37). In the religion of Zoroaster frequent washing with water was prescribed for many kinds of impurity (Zendavesta, 8. p. 271, et seq.). The Greeks were particularly addicted to ceremonies of which ablution formed a part; and it is to Rome that we are indebted both for the word and for the idea of \"lustration.\" It is a true instinct which has taught men the analogy between physical and moral purity, and led them to typify the removal of spiritual, by the cleansing from physical, defilement. The religion given at Sinai set a stamp of approval in many points on what may be called \"the religion of nature;\" and among them on this. Ablutions were required of the priests, not only at consecration, but every time that they entered the tabernacle, or sacrificed on the altar of burnt-offering (Exodus 30:20). Washing was a main feature in the cleansing of leprosy (Leviticus 13:54, 58) and of the leper. (Leviticus 14:8). It was also employed for the purification of many minor defilements (Leviticus 11:25; Leviticus 15:5; Leviticus 17:15, etc.). At what date it first came into use in the admission of proselytes is uncertain. Whether the washing of consecration extended to the whole body, or was limited to the hands and feet, is also a point on which critics have disagreed, but one of no great importance. (See John 13:9, 10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - The Investiture of Aaron. Verse 5. - Thou shalt take the garments. The directions, as here given, are incomplete, and not quite in the right order. In the LXX. they are still more incomplete. For the full process of investiture, we mast look to Leviticus 8:7-9. There we find that the process included nine acts. -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The putting on of the linen tunic.NEWLINENEWLINE2.

The plate of gold with its blue ribbon, or lace, formed a species of diadem, such as in the East seems to have been always regarded as the special emblem of royalty. An ornament of the kind seems to have been introduced into Egypt by Khuenaten or Amenophis IV. It marked the royal character of the high priest, who, as the main type of Christ in the Mosaic law, was bound to be \"Prophet, Priest, and King.\" (Compare Leviticus 8:9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The Chrism or Anointing. Verse 7. - The anointing oil had been mentioned previously in Exodus 25:6, when \"spices\" had been required from the congregation to form a portion of it. Its composition is given in Exodus 30:23-25; a passage from which we gather that it was exceedingly rich and costly. And pour it upon his head. Compare Psalm 133:2. While ablution is a rite common to many religions, the religious use of unction is peculiar to the Mosaic and the Christian. In the Mosaic it was applied to initiate into their office the prophet, the priest, and the king. In Christianity it was originally a rite by which sick persons were miraculously cured (James 5:14, 15), from which use it was afterwards extended by ecclesiastical authority to other important ceremonies. The typical meaning under Christianity is clear; the oil represents the Holy Spirit, and the anointing the outpouring of that Spirit on those who are the objects of it. Christ himself obtained his title of Christ (or Messiah), because he was \"anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power\" (Acts 10:38). Under Mosaism this idea was, at most, latent. Unction was understood to markNEWLINENEWLINE(1) Dignity, because the olive was the first of trees (Judges 9:9); andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) Continuance, because oil preserves things for a long time from corruption. Unction with the holy oil of the sanctuary no doubt further signified consecration to God's service. It was applied not only to the priests, but to the tabernacle, the ark, the table of shew-bread with its vessels, the seven branched candlestick, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering, and the laver, all of which thereupon became \"most holy\" (Exodus 30:26-29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The Investiture of Aaron's sons.

Rather \"caps.\" There is no article. Thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. Literally, \"Thou shalt fill the hand of Aaron and the hand of his sons.\" Installation in an office was usually effected among the Eastern nations by putting into the hand of the official the insignia which marked his functions. In this particular case certain portions of the offerings were used as the insignia. See ver. 24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-34. - The Consecration Offerings. Verse 10. - Thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought. Rather, \"the bullock,\" - i.e., \"the bullock mentioned in ver. 1, which was to be made ready before the ceremonies commenced.\" Aaron and his sons were to put their hands upon the head of the bullock, in order to identify themselves with it, and transfer to it the guilt of their own sins and imperfections, since it was to be a \"sin-offering\" (ver. 14; compare Leviticus 4:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou shalt take of the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar. The virtue of the altar was regarded as residing especially in its horns. Here expiation was obtained by the blood - \"which is the life \" - of the victim being first smeared upon the four horns, and then the remainder poured out at the altar's base. Such was the usual practice with \"sin-offerings\" (Leviticus 4:7) whereof this was to be the first example.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou shalt take all the fat, etc. Among all nations who have offered sacrifices, it has been very usual to select certain parts of the victim only for burning upon the altar, and to dispose otherwise of the remainder. The Greeks commonly burnt on the altar the thighs and the fat only. The Romans burnt certain parts of the intestines only, and called them prosecta, prosiciae, or ablegmina. In Egypt, according to Herodotus, the greater part of the body was burnt; but the head, the neck, the shoulders, and the lower part of the legs, as well as the paunch, were reserved and not burnt (Herod. 2:40). The fat was generally regarded as the best part of the offering, and most acceptable to the gods. This was probably on account of its burning with a bright flame and helping to consume the rest of the offering. The caul that is above the liver. Probably the membrane which covers the upper part of the liver, sometimes called \"the small omentum.\" (reticulum jecoris, Vulg.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The flesh... shalt thou burn with fire without the camp. Such was the rule with sin-offerings generally (Leviticus 4:11, 12). The curse of sin which was on them, made them unfit for food and even unworthy of burial within the camp. On the symbolism of the burial, see Hebrews 13:11-13. His dung. That which the bowels contained at the time of death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - One ram. Literally \"the one ram\" - i.e., \"one of the two rams mentioned in verse 1. Put their hands. Here, again, the object was to identify themselves with the victim, and make it their representative; though now, as the ram was to be a burnt offering, self-sacrifice, rather than expiation, was the leading thought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Thou shalt take his blood and sprinkle it. Rather, \"and cast it.\" The blood was to be thrown from a basin, not sprinkled with the hand or with hyssop. Rabbinical tradition says that it was so cast at two of the corners, and thus moistened all the four sides. This was regarded as casting it \"on the altar round about.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou shalt cut the ram in pieces. Literally, \"into its pieces,\" which Kalisch supposes to mean \"into its natural limbs.\" Egyptian sculptures show us animals thus cut up, and offered at sacrificial feasts to ancestors. Wash its inwards - i.e., its \"intestines\" - probably the stomach and bowels only. Its legs. The lower joints of the leg, with the foot, to which it was likely that dust might attach. Put them unto his pieces - i.e., \"replace them after washing with the other pieces,\" or joints, into which the animal had been cut.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar. This became the general law of the burnt-offering (Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17). It indicated that self-sacrifice was wholly acceptable to God; whereas in sin-offerings there was a taint of evil which rendered all but certain parts of the victim unacceptable (ver. 14). A sweet savour. This is not to be understood in the coarse sense in which heathen writers used similar expressions, meaning by them (as it would seem) that the gods were really pleased with the odour of sacrifices. No candid mind can ascribe to the Hebrews such anthropomorphism. Evidently no more is meant than that the offering would be pleasing to God. See Genesis 8:21; Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The other ram. Compare ver. 15; and see also vers. I and 3, where two rams had been mentioned. This second ram is called, \"the ram of consecration\" in ver. 22, and again in Leviticus 8:22. It was \"by far the most peculiar part of the whole ceremony\" (S. Clark). It must be viewed as a \"peace-offering\" (Leviticus 3:1-17), but one of a peculiar character. The application of the blood to the persons of the priests was altogether unique, and most significant. It was the crowning act of consecration, and implied the complete dedication of their life and of all their powers to the service of the Almighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The victim having been offered and accepted, its blood had a sanctifying power. Placed upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons, it sanctified that organ, which was to be ever open to the Divine voice; placed upon the thumb of their right hand, it sanctified their ministerial actions; placed upon the great toe of their right foot, it sanctified their whole walk in life, their \"going out,\" and their \"coming in.\" The consecrated life of the victim which they had offered \"was given back to them, in order that it might be devoted to the service of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Thou shalt take of the blood... . and of the anointing oil. Apparently, this is the only unction that the ordinary priests were to receive. (Compare Leviticus 8:30.) The mixture of the blood with the oil is unusual, and presents some difficulties; but perhaps it is best to view it as symbolising the intimate union which exists between justification and sanctification - the atoning blood, and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit. And sprinkle it. The verb is different from that used in ver. 16, and is rightly rendered, \"sprinkle.\" He shall be hallowed and his garments. As the garments shared in the sprinkling, they shared also, so far as was possible, in the consecration. It was hence especially that they became \"holy garments.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The rump. Rather, \"the tail.\" Oriental sheep have very commonly a broad fat tail, which weighs from six to twenty pounds, and is sometimes laid upon a little cart with two wheels, which the sheep drags after it (Herod. 3:113; Leo African. 9. p. 293 A; Fellows, Asia Minor, p. 10; Gesenius ad voc. אליה). There is no doubt that a \"tail\" of this kind is here meant. The caul. Rather, \"the membrane.\" See the comment on ver 13. The right shoulder. Or \"leg,\" according to some. The difference is not important.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - One cake of oiled bread - i.e., one of the \"unleavened cakes tempered with oil,\" mentioned in ver. 2. Out of the basket of the unleavened bread. See ver. 3.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Thou shalt put all in the hands, or \"on the hands.\" The offerings were to be laid first, on the hands of Aaron, and then on those of his sons, which were to support them; while Moses, putting his hands under theirs, made a waving motion with them towards the four corners of the heavens, to indicate that the gifts were offered to the omnipresent God. This process was that \"filling of the hand,\" by which the actual installation in office took place. Moses, by the act, transferred the priestly functions, which he had hitherto exercised, to his brother and his brother's descendants. He made them by his muscular energy perform their first priestly act.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Thou shalt receive them at their hands and burn them. Moses was still to continue the priestly acts, and to complete the peace-offering by burning the selected parts (ver. 22) on the brazen altar. (See Leviticus 3:3-5.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Thou shalt take the breast. Henceforth Aaron and his sons were to have the breast of all wave-offerings (Leviticus 7:31-34); but on this occasion, as Moses officiated, the breast was to be his.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - A short digression is here made, from this particular offering, to all future offerings for consecration. For the future both the breast and the right shoulder are to belong to the priests. The shoulder, moreover, is to be \"heaved,\" and only the breast \"waved; .... heaving\" being a single lifting up of the offering towards heaven, while\" waving\" was a repeated movement in a horizontal direction. Wave and heave offerings are always connected with the portions of the priests, or with things dedicated to God's service. (See Exodus 25:2; Exodus 35:22, 24; Exodus 38:24, 29; Leviticus 7:30-34; Numbers 18:11, 19, 24, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - Here we have a second digression, also concerning future consecrations. The holy garments made for Aaron were to be preserved after his death, and used at the consecration of each successive high priest, who was to be anointed and consecrated in them, and to wear them for seven days from the time that he entered upon his office. Eleazar's investment in them is mentioned (Numbers 20:28); but not that of any later high priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The ram of consecration - i.e., the part of the ram that was left and had not been burnt (ver. 25). Seethe his flesh in the holy place. This was understood to mean boiling at the door of the tabernacle (Leviticus 8:31). A sacrificial meal followed on every peace-offering, in which the offerers participated. (See above, Exodus 18:12.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The bread that is in the basket - i.e., the loaf, cake, and wafer which still remained in the basket after one of each had been subtracted (see ver. 23, and compare vers. 2, 3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - They shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made. An atoning force pervaded all sacrifice. Sin-offerings were wholly expiatory; burnt-offerings and peace-offerings partially so (Leviticus 1:4). A stranger shall not eat thereof. \"A stranger\" in this place does not mean a foreigner, but anyone who is not a priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Thou shalt burn the remainder with fire. Compare above, Exodus 12:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-37. - The repetition of the ceremonial, and the consecration of the altar. Verse 35. - Seven days shalt thou consecrate them. The repetition of the ceremony seven times on seven separate days seems to be intended. Thus was an ideal completeness given to it. Compare the seven days' compassing around of Jericho (Joshua 6:3, 4,), the seven washings in Jordan by Naaman (2 Kings 5:14), the seven ascents to the top of Carmel by the servant of Elijah (1 Kings 18:43, 44), etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it. Rather, \"thou shelf purify the altar by making an atonement for it.\" The sin-offering for the altar was the same bullock which served for Aaron and his sons. Its virtue was applied to the altar by smearing the blood upon its horns and pouring the remainder at its base (ver. 12). See Leviticus 8:15: - \"And Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it.\" And thou shalt anoint it. In his execution of these directions, Moses separated the anointing of the altar from the cleansing, placing it even before the anointing of Aaron. He anointed it by sprinkling the holy oil upon it seven times (Leviticus 8:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Seven days shalt thou make an atonement. All the ceremonial was to be repeated seven times, not only the atonement for the altar (Leviticus 8:33). An altar most holy. Literally, \"holiness of holinesses,\" as in Exodus 40:10. Whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy. Rather, \"must be holy.\" Nothing that is not holy must touch it (Kalisch).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 29:38-42NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 38-42. - THE DAILY SACRIFICE. The consecration of the altar, which is made a part of the consecration of the priests, is to be followed immediately by the establishment of the daily sacrifice. Two lambs are to be offered day by day to the Lord, one in the morning and the other in the evening, as \"a continual burnt-offering\" (ver. 42), in acknowledgment that the life of the people belonged to Jehovah (Cook), aria that they were bound to offer perpetually \"themselves, their souls and bodies, to be a reasonable holy, and lively sacrifice\" to him. The burnt-offerings were to be accompanied by appropriate \"meat and drink-offerings\" - i.e., by a certain quantity of flour mingled with olive oil for the one, and a certain quantity of wine for the other - indications of the debt of gratitude which the nation owed to God for his continual benefits Verse 38. - Lambs of the first year. Compare Exodus 12:5. The LXX. add \"without blemish.\" But this is unnecessary, as all victims were to be without blemish (Leviticus 22:20: Deuteronomy 15:21, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - At even. Literally, \"between the two evenings.\" (See the comment on Exodus 12:6.) Josephus says (Ant. Jud. 14:4, § 3) that the hour in ordinary use was three.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - A tenth deal - i.e., a \"tenth part.\" The tenth part of an ephah is no doubt meant. This was sometimes called \"an omen\" (Exodus 16:36), and would be about three pounds weight of flour, or a little more. One fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. The word hin is said to be Egyptian. It occurs here for the first time. The bin was the sixth part of a bath, and probably contained about one pint and a half English. The fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink-offering. The application of the \"drink-offerings\" is uncertain. Josephus says (Ant. Jud. 3:9, § 4) that they were poured out round the brazen altar. But the analogy of the \"meat offering\" makes it probable that a portion only was thus treated, while the greater part belonged to the priests. In the entire provision by which burnt and peace-offering were to be necessarily accompanied with meat-offerings and drink-offerings, we can scarcely be wrong in seeing an arrangement made especially for the convenience of the priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Thou shalt do thereto according to the meat-offering, etc. \"Thou shalt offer\" - i.e., \"the same meat-offering and drink-offering with the evening as with the morning sacrifice.\" For a sweet savour, See the comment on ver. 18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Throughout your generations. Rather, \"for your generations.\" The tabernacle of the congregation. Rather, \"of meeting\" - \"the tabernacle of meeting, where I will meet you.\" The verb and substantive are modifications of the same word, ועד. It is this passage which definitely fixes the meaning of the phrase incorrectly rendered \"the tabernacle of the congregation\" by our translators.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 29:43-46NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 43-46. - GOD'S PROMISES. The chapter terminates with a parenthetic insertion of various promises, intended to cheer the Israelites under the hard circumstances of their wanderings in the wilderness, and growing out of the mention of the tabernacle as \"the tabernacle of meeting\" (ver. 42). \"There,\" says God, \"He will meet, not only Moses, to speak to him, but also the children of Israel, to receive their offerings, hear their prayers, and grant their requests. There will he meet them, and there his glory shall be; and the tabernacle shall be thereby sanctified. He will sanctify both the tabernacle and the altar; he will sanctify, moreover, both Aaron and his sons; and he will dwell among the children of Israel, and be their God; and they shall know him.\" Very precious and gracious promises, made absolutely; though, as the result showed (2 Chronicles 36:14-18), contingent on their obedience; and faithfully performed, as long as even a remnant was obedient, during a space of above seven hundred years from the Exodus to the Captivity! Verse 43. - There will I meet the children of Israel. Lay Israelites might not enter the tabernacle, and could only \"meet God\" at its entrance, when they brought their sacrifices to the altar. He promises, however, to meet them on these occasions with favour and. acceptance. The tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. Compare Exodus 40:34. The presence of the Shechinah was the true sanctification of the tabernacle - all the rest was mere type and figure. God not only \"put his name there,\" but put his presence there visibly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - I will sanctify... the altar. See Leviticus 9:24, where we learn that on the first occasion of Aaron's offering sacrifice upon the brazen altar, \"there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat.\" Thus the altar had its miraculous sanctification, as well as the tabernacle, and was not merely consecrated by human instrumentality. I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons. It would seem to follow, by parity of reasoning, that here also something more is intended than had been accomplished by the rites of consecration. The verb is in the future - \"I will sanctify\" - and must allude to something which has not yet taken place. Probably, sanctification of the spirit is intended - that Divine influence upon the heart which alone makes men really and truly \"holy.\" (Compare Leviticus 21:8, 15; Leviticus 22:9, 16.) But in this case the promise must have been conditional. God would sanctify them so far as they would allow him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - I will dwell among the children of Israel. Compare Exodus 25:8. Primarily, the indwelling of the Shechinah in the holy of holies is, no doubt, meant; but the expression need not be limited to this. God would be present with his people in manifold ways - to direct, sustain, enlighten, defend, and save them. And will be their God. Compare Exodus 6:7. What treasures of love, protection, bounty, tenderness, and pardon, are there in this phrase!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus29:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - And they shall know, etc. When they experience my protection, bounty, love, tenderness, pardon, they shall truly feel and know in their inmost hearts, that I am the same God who delivered them out of the bondage of Egypt, and brought them forth, for the very purpose of \"dwelling among them.\" I am Jehovah, their God. No other God could deliver after this sort. No other God could be so long-suffering to a \"stiff-necked people.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - THE BIRTH, ESCAPE, AND EDUCATION OF MOSES. Some years before the Pharaoh issued his edict for the general destruction of the Hebrew male children, Amram of the tribe of Levi, had married Jochebed, his kinswoman (Exodus 6:20). They had already had two children - Miriam, a daughter, born probably soon after the marriage, and Aaron, a son, born some twelve years later. Soon after the issue of the edict, Jochebed gave birth to her third child, a son, who therefore came under its terms. Knowing as she did what fate was in store for him, if his existence became known to the Egyptians, she \"hid him three months.\" Then, despairing of being able to keep him concealed much longer, she devised the plan related in vers. 3-4, which proved successful. Verse 1. - There went a man. The Hebrew language is deficient in tenses, and cannot mark pluperfect time. The meaning is, that \"a man of the house of Levi had gone, some time before, and taken to wife a daughter of Levi.\" Miriam must have been fourteen or fifteen at the time of the exposure of Moses. By a daughter of Levi, we must not understand an actual daughter, which is irreconcilable with the chronology, but one of Levi's descendants - \"a wife of the daughters of Levi,\" as the LXX. translates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And the woman conceived. Not for the first time, as appears from ver. 4, nor even for the second, as we learn from Exodus 7:7; but for the third. Aaron was three years old when Moses was born. As no difficulty has occurred with respect to him, we must regard the edict as issued between his birth and that of Moses. When she saw that he was a goodly child. Perhaps Jochebed would have done the same had Moses been ill-favoured, for mothers have often loved best their weakest and sickliest; but still it nard-rally seemed to her the harder that she was called upon to lose a strong and beautiful baby; and this is what the writer means to express - the clauses are not \"simply co-ordinate.\" She hid him - i.e, kept him within the house - perhaps even in the female apartments. Egyptians were mixed up with the Israelites in Goshen - not perhaps in any great numbers, but still so that no Hebrew felt himself safe from observation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - She took for him an ark of bulrushes. The words translated \"ark\" and \"bulrushes\" are both of Egyptian origin, the former corresponding to the ordinary word for \"chest,\" which is feb, teba, or tebat, and the latter corresponding to the Egyptian kam, which is the same in Coptic, and designates the papyrus plant. This is a strong-growing rush, with a triangular stem, which attains the height of from 10 to 15 feet. The Egyptian paper was made from its pith. The rush itself was used for various purposes - among others for boat-building (Plin. 'H. N.' 6:22; 7:16; Theophrast, 4:9; Pint. 'De Isid. et Osir.' § 18, etc.), as appears from the monuments. It would be a very good material for the sort of purpose to which Jochebed applied it. She daubed it with slime and with pitch. The word translated \"slime\" is the same as that used in Genesis 11:3, which is generally thought to mean \"mineral pitch\" or \"bitumen.\" According to Strabo and Dioderus, that material was largely used by the Egyptians for the embalming of corpses, and was imported into Egypt from Palestine. Boats are sometimes covered with it externally at the present day (Ker Porter, Travels, vol. 2. p. 260; Layard,'Nineveh and its Remains,' pt. 2. ch. 5.); but Jochebed seems to have used vegetable pitch- the ordinary pitch of commerce - for the purpose. Here again the Hebrew word is taken from the Egyptian. She laid it in the flags. \"Suph,\" the word translated \"flags,\" is a modification of the Egyptian tuff, which has that meaning. Water-plants of all kinds abound in the backwaters of the Nile. and the marshy tracts communicating with it. The object of placing the ark in a thicket of reeds probably was, that it might not float away out of sight. The river's brink. Literally, the lip of the river - an Egyptian idiom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His sister. There can be no reasonable doubt that this is the \"Miriam\" of the later narrative (Exodus 15:20, 21; Numbers 20:1), who seems to have been Moses' only sister (Numbers 26:59). She was probably set to watch by her mother.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The daughter of Pharaoh. Probably a daughter of Seti I. and a sister of Rameses the Great. Josephus calls her Thermuthis; Syncellus, Pharia; Artapanus, Merrhis, and some of the Jewish commentators, Bithia - the diversity showing that there was no genuine tradition on the subject. There is nothing improbable in an Egyptian princess bathing in the Nile, at a place reserved for women. (See Wilkinson, 'Manners and Customs of Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 389.) The Nile was regarded as sacred, and its water as health-giving and fructifying (Strab. 15. p. 695). Her maidens. Egyptian ladies of high rank are represented on the monuments as attended to the bath by a number of handmaidens. As many as four are seen in one representation (Wilkinson, 1.s.c.). Her maid is her special personal attendant, the others being merely women attached to her household.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The princess herself opened the \"ark,\" which was a sort of covered basket. Perhaps she suspected what she would find inside; but would it be a living or a dead child? This she could not know. She opened, and looked. It was a living babe, and it wept. At once her woman's heart, heathen as she was, went out to the child - its tears reached the common humanity that lies below all differences of race and creed - and she pitied it. \"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.\" This is one of the Hebrews' children. Hebrew characteristics were perhaps stamped even upon the infant visage. Or she formed her conclusion merely from the circumstances. No Egyptian woman had any need to expose her child, or would be likely to do so; but it was just what a Hebrew mother, under the cruel circumstances of the time, might have felt herself forced to do. So she drew her conclusion, rapidly and decidedly, as is the way of woman.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-9. - Then said his sister. Miriam had watched to some purpose. She had seen everything - she had drawn near as she beheld the \"maid\" go down to the water's edge, and take the ark out. She had heard the words of the princess; and thereupon she promptly spoke - \"Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women?\" No doubt, all had been prepared beforehand by the mother, who had selected the place and time of the exposure from a knowledge of the habits and character of the princess, had set her daughter to watch, and - so far as was possible - instructed her what she was to say. But Miriant at least carried out the instructions given her with excellent judgment and tact. She did not speak too soon, nor too late. She did not say a word too much, nor too little. \"Surely,\" exclaimed the princess, \"this is one of the Hebrews, children.\" \"Shall I fetch thee then a Hebrew mother to nurse him? is the rejoinder. Egyptians, it is implied, cannot properly nurse Hebrews - cannot know how they ought to be treated; an Egyptian nurse would mismanage the boy - shall I fetch one of his own nation? And the princess, feeling all the force of the reasoning, answers in one short pregnant word - \"Go.\" \"Yes,\" she means, \"do so; that will be best.\" And then the result follows - \"The maid (Miriam) went and called the child's mother.\" So the scheming of the loving mother, and the skilful performance of the part assigned her by the clever sister, were crowned with success - Moses' life was saved, and yet he was not separated from his natural guardian, nor given over to the tender mercies of strangers: the child went back to his own home, to his own apartment, to his own cradle; continued to be nourished by his own mother's milk; and received those first impressions, which are so indelibly impressed upon the mind, in a Hebrew family. Pharaoh's daughter said, \"Take this child away, and nurse it for me.\" \"Take him with you - take him to your own home for a while - and there nurse him for me, as long as he needs nursing.\" And to mark that he is mine, and not yours - to silence inquiry - to stop the mouths of informers - \"I will give thee thy wages.\" Jochebed was more than content, and \"took the child and nursed it.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The child grew. Compare Genesis 21:8, where the full phrase is used - \"The child grew, and was weaned.\" Jocbebed had saved her son's life by a transfer of her mother's right in him to Pharaoh's daughter. She had received him back, merely as a hired nurse, to suckle him. When the time came, probably at the end of the second year, for him to be weaned, she was bound, whatever the sufferings of her heart may have been, to give him up - to restore him to her from whom she had received him, as a child put out to nurse. And we see that she made no attempt to escape her obligations. No sooner was the boy weaned, than \"she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter\" - as it would seem, of her own accord. And he became her son. There is no evidence that formal \"adoption\" was a custom of the Egyptians; and probably no more is here meant than that the princess took the child into her family, and brought him up as if he had been her son, giving him all the privileges of a son, together with such an education as a princess's son usually received. We obtain the best general idea of what such an education was from the words of St. Stephen (Acts 7:21) - \"Now Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.\" This \"wisdom,\" though not perhaps very deep, was multiform and manifold. It included orthography, grammar, history, theology, medicine, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and engineering. Education began, as in most countries, with orthography and grammar. The hieroglyphical system was probably not taught, and the knowledge of it remained a special privilege of the priest-class: but the cursive character, known as the hieratic, was generally studied, and all tolerably educated persons could read it and write it. Style was cultivated, and though no great progress was made in the graces of finished composition, the power of expressing thought and relating facts in a simple and perspicuous prose was acquired by the greater number. Much attention was paid to letter-writing; and models of business and other letters were set before the pupil as patterns which he was to follow. By the more advanced, poetry was read, and poetic composition occasionally practised. Arithmetic and geometry, up to a certain point, were studied by all; and a plain morality was inculcated. But history, theology, astronomy, medicine, and engineering, were viewed as special studies, to be pursued by those intended for certain professions, rather than as included within the curriculum of an ordinary education; and it may well be doubted whether Moses' attention was much directed to any of them. He may indeed have been initiated into the mysteries, and in that case would have come to understand the esoteric meaning of the Egyptian myths, and of all that most revolts moderns in the Egyptian religion. But, on the whole, it is most probable that he was rather trained for active than for speculative life, and received the education which fitted men for the service of the State, not that which made them dreamers and theorists. His great praise is, that \"he was mighty in words and deeds \"(Acts, 1.s.c.); and he was certainly anything rather than a recluse student. We should do wrong to regard him as either a scientific man or a philosopher. His genius was practical; and his education was of a practical kind - such as fitted him to become the leader of his people in a great emergency, to deal on equal terms with a powerful monarch, and to guide to a happy conclusion the hazardous enterprise of a great national migration. And she called his name Moses. The Egyptian form of the name was probably Mesu, which signifies \"born, brought forth, child,\" and is derived from a root meaning \"to produce,\" \"draw forth.\" Egyptian has many roots common to it with Hebrew, whereof this is one. The princess's play upon words thus admitted of being literally rendered in the Hebrew - \"he called his name Mosheh (drawn forth); because, she said, I drew him forth (meshithi-hu) from the water.\" Mesu is found in the monuments as an Egyptian name under the nineteenth dynastyNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 2:11-15NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-15. - FIRST ATTEMPT OF MOSES TO DELIVER HIS NATION, AND ITS FAILURE. After Moses was grown up - according to the tradition accepted by St. Stephen (Acts 7:23), when he was \"full forty years old\" - having become by some means or other acquainted with the circumstances of his birth, which had most probably never been concealed from him, he determined to \"go out\" to his brethren, see with his own eyes what their treatment was, and do his best to alleviate it. He had as yet no Divine mission, no command from God to act as he did, but only a natural sympathy with his people, and a feeling perhaps that in his position he was bound, more than any one else, to make some efforts to ameliorate what must have been generally known to be a hard lot. It is scarcely likely that he had formed any definite plans. How he should act would depend on what he should see. Thus far, his conduct deserves nothing but praise. It only perhaps a little surprises us (if St. Stephen's tradition accords with fact) that he did not earlier in his life take some steps in the direction here indicated. We are bound to recollect, however, that we know very little of the restraints under which he would have been laid - whether a severe law of etiquette, or the commands of his benefactress, may not have hampered him, and caused the long delay which strikes us as strange. Living with the court - in Tunis probably - he would have been required to make a strong effort - to break through an established routine, and strike out for himself a new and unheard-of course, if he quitted the princess's household to make a tour of inspection among the enslaved Hebrews. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews seems to consider that his act in \"going out\" to \"look upon the burdens\" of his people involved a renunciation of his court life - a refusal to be called any more the son of Pharaoh's daughter (Hebrews 11:240; a casting-in of his lot with his brethren, so as thenceforth to be a sharer in their afflictions (ib. ver. 24). If this were so, we can well understand a long period of hesitation before the resolve was made to take the course from which there was no retreating. Verse 11. - When Moses was grown. \"When he had become a mall of vigour and intelligence\" (Kalisch). He went out. The expression is emphatic, and accords with the view above exhibited - that a complete change in the life of Moses was now effected, that the court was quitted, with its attractions and its temptations, its riches and its pleasures; and the position of adopted child of a princess forfeited. He spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew. It is not certain that this was one of the \"taskmasters\" (Exodus 1:11); but most probably he was either a taskmaster, or one of the officers employed by them. Such persons are on the Egyptian monuments represented as armed with long rods, said to be \"made of a tough pliant wood imported from Syria\" (Chabas, 'Voyage d'un Egyptien,' p. 119). It was their right to employ their rods on the backs of the idle, a right which was sure to degenerate in many cases into tyrannous and cruel oppression. We may assume that it was an instance of such abuse of power that excited the anger of Moses; \"seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed\" (Acts 7:24). For a light fault, or no fault at all, a heavy chastisement was being inflicted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He looked this way and that way. Passion did not so move him as to make him reckless. He looked round to see that he was not observed,, and then, when he saw there was no man, slew the Egyptian. A wrongful act, the outcome of an ardent but undisciplined spirit; not to be placed among the deeds \"which history records as noble and magnanimous (Kalisch), but among those which are hasty and regrettable. A warm sympathetic nature, an indignant hatred of wrong-doing, may have lain at the root of the crime, but do not justify it, though they may qualify our condemnation of it. (See the remarks of St. Augustine quoted by Keil and Delitzsch, 'Commentary on the Pentateuch,' vol. 1. p. 451: \"I affirm that the man, though criminal and really the offender, ought not to have been put to death by one who had no legal authority to do so. But minds that are capable of virtue often produce vices also, and show thereby for what virtue they would have been best adapted, if they had but been properely trained,\" etc.) And hid him in the sand. There is abundant \"sand\" in the \"field of Zoan,\" and in all the more eastern portion of the land of Goshen. (See the 'Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund' for July, 1880, p. 140.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The second day. i.e. \"the following day.\" See Acts 7:26. Him that did the wrong. Literally, \"the wicked one.\" Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? Literally \"thy neighbour.\" In interposing here Moses certainly did nothing but what was right. The strife was one in which blows were being exchanged, and it is the duty of everyone in such a case, by persuasion at any rate. to seek to stop the combat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? It was not his interference now, but his wrongful act of the day before, that exposed Moses to this rebuke. There was no assumption of lordship or of judicial authority in the bare inquiry, \"Why smitest thou thy neighhour?\" nor in the fuller phrase reported by St. Stephen, \"Sirs, ye are brethren. Why do ye wrong one to another?\" (Acts 7:26), unless as coupled with the deed of the preceding day. Thus the violence of today renders of no avail the loving persuasion of to-morrow; the influence for good which the education and position of Moses might have enabled him to exercise upon his nation was lost by the very act to which he had been urged by his sympathy with them; it was an act which could be thrown in his teeth, an act which he could not justify, which he trembled to find was known. The retort of the aggressor stopped his mouth at once, and made his interposition valueless.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Pharaoh heard. If we have been right in supposing the Pharaoh of the original oppression to have been Seti I., the present Pharaoh, from whom Moses flies when he is \"full forty years old\" (Acts 7:23), and who does not die till Moses is near eighty, must be his son, the Great Rameses, Rameses II. This prince was associated by his father at the age of ten or twelve (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2. pp. 24-5), and reigned sixty-seven years, as appears from his monuments. He is the only king of the New Empire whose real reign exceeded forty years, and thus the only monarch who fulfils the conditions required by the narrative of Exodus supplemented by St. Stephen's speech in the Acts. He sought to slay Moses. We need not understand from this expression that the Pharaoh's will was thwarted or opposed by anything but the sudden disappearance of Moses. As St. Stephen says (Acts 7:29), \"Then fled Moses at this saying,\" i.e. at the mere words of the aggressor, \"Writ thou slay me as thou didst the Egyptian?\" Moses fled, knowing what he had to expect, quitted Egypt, went to Midian; and the Egyptian monarch \"sought to slay him\" too late. The land of Midian is a somewhat vague expression, for the Midianites were nomads, and at different times occupied distinct and even remote localities. Their principal settlements appear to have been on the eastern side of the Elanitic Gulf (Gulf of Akabah); but at times they extended northwards to the confines of Moab (Genesis 36:35; Numbers 22:4, 7, etc.), and westward into the Sinaitic peninsula, which appears to have been \"the land of Midian whereto Moses fled (see below, Exodus 3:1). The Midianites are not expressly mentioned in the Egyptian inscriptions. They were probably included among the Mentu, with whom the Egyptians contended in the Sinaitic region, and from whom they took the copper district north-west of Sinai. And he sat down by a well. Rather \"and he dwelt by the well.\" He took up his abode in the neighbourhood of the principal well belonging to the tract here called Midian. The tract was probably one of no great size, an offshoot of the greater Midian on the other side of the gulf. We cannot identify the well; but it was certainly not that near the town of Modiana, Ñ spoken of by Edrisi and Abulfeda, which was in Arabia Proper, on the east of the gulf.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 2:16-22NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-22. - LIFE OF MOSES IN MIDIAN. Fugitives from Egypt generally took the northern route from Pelusium or Migdol to Gaza, and so to Syria, or the regions beyond. But in this quarter they were liable to be arrested and sent back to the Egyptian monarch. Rameses II: put a special clause to this effect into his treaty with the contemporary Hittite king (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2 p. 73). It was, perhaps, the fear of extradition which made Moses turn his steps southeastward, and proceed along the route, or at any rate in the direction, which he afterwards took with his nation. Though Egypt had possessions in the Sinaitic peninsula, it was not difficult to avoid them; and before Sinai was reached the fugitive would be in complete safety, for the Egyptians seem never to have penetrated to the southern or eastern parts of the great triangle. \"The well,\" by which Moses took up his abode, is placed with some probability in the neighbourhood of Sherm, about ten miles north-east of Ras Mahommed, the southern cape of the peninsula Verse 16. - The priest of Midian. Cohen is certainly \"priest\" here, and not \"prince,\" since the father-in-law of Moses exercises priestly functions in Exodus 18:12. His seven daughters drew water for his flock, in accordance with Eastern custom. So Rachel \"kept the sheep\" of her father Laban, and watered them (Genesis 29:9). Such a practice agrees well with the simplicity of primitive times and peoples; nor would it even at the present day be regarded as strange in Arabia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The shepherds came and drove them away. There is not much \"natural politeness\" among primitive peoples. The right of the stronger prevails, and women go to the wall. Even the daughters of their priest were not respected by these rude sons of the desert, who would not wait their turn, but used the water which Reners daughters had drawn. The context shows that this was not an accidental or occasional circumstance, but the regular practice of the shepherds, who thus day after day saved themselves the trouble of drawing. (See the next verse.) Moses stood up and helped them. Ever ready to assist the weak against the strong (supra, vers. 12, 13), Moses \"stood up\" - sprang to his feet - and, though only one man against a dozen or a score, by his determined air intimidated the crowd of wrong-doers, and forced them to let the maidens' sheep drink at the troughs. His dress was probably that of an Egyptian of rank; and they might reasonably conclude from his boldness that he had attendants within call.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Reuel their father. Reuel is called \"Raguel\" in Numbers 10:29, but the Hebrew spelling is the same in both places. The word means \"friend of God,\" and implies monotheisim. Compare Exodus 18:9-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - An Egyptian. Reuel's daughters judged by the outward appearance. Moses wore the garb and probably spoke the language of Egypt. He had had no occasion to reveal to them his real nationality. Drew water enough for us. The shepherds had consumed some of the water drawn by the maidens, before Moses could drive them off. He supplied the deficiency by drawing more for them - an act of polite attention.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Where is he? Reuel reproaches his daughters with a want of politeness - even of gratitude. Why have they \"left the man\"? Why have they not invited him in? They must themselves remedy the omission - they must go and \"call him\" - that he \"may eat bread,\" or take his evening meal with them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Moses was content to dwell with the man. Moses had fled from Egypt without any definite plan, simply to save his life, and had now to determine how he would obtain a subsistence. Received into Reuel's house, or tent, pleased with the man and with his family, he consented to stay with him, probably entered into his service, as Jacob into Laban's (Genesis 29:15-20), kept his sheep, or otherwise made himself useful (see Exodus 3:1); and in course of time Reuel gave Moses his daughter, accepted him for his son-in-law, so that he became not merely a member of his household, but of his family, was adopted probably into the tribe, so that he could not quit it without permission (Exodus 4:18), and, so far as his own intention went, cast in his lot with the Midianites, with whom he meant henceforth to live and die. Such vague ideas as he may previously have entertained of his \"mission\" had passed away; he had been \"disillusioned\" by his ill-success, and now looked forward to nothing but a life of peaceful obscurity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Gershom. An Egyptian etymology has been assigned to this name ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1, p. 488); but Moses in the text clearly indicates that his own intention was to give his child a name significant in Hebrew. \"He called his name Gershom, for he said, a stranger (ger) have I been,\" etc. The only question is, what the second element of the name, shom, means. This appears to be correctly explained by Kalisch and others as equivalent to sham \"there \" - so that the entire word would mean \"(I was) a stranger there\" - i.e. in the country where this son was born to me.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 2:23-25NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-25. - DEATH OF THE PHARAOH FROM WHOM MOSES FLED - CONTINUANCE OF THE OPPRESSION OF ISRAEL-ISRAEL'S PRAYERS - GOD'S ACCEPTANCE OF THEM. - After a space of forty years from the time of Moses' flight from Egypt, according to the estimate of St. Stephen (Acts 7:30), which is not, however, to be strictly pressed, the king whose anger he had provoked - Rameses II., as we believe - died. He had reigned sixty-seven years - about forty-seven alone, and about twenty in conjunction with his father. At his death, the oppressed Israelites ventured to hope for some amelioration of their condition. On his accession, a king in the East often reverses the policy of his predecessor, or at any rate, to make himself popular, grants a remission of burthens for a certain period. But at this time the new monarch, Menephthah I., the son of Rameses II., disappointed the hopes of the Israelites, maintained his father's policy, continued the established system of oppression, granted them no relief of any kind. They \"sighed,\" therefore, in consequence of their disappointment, and \"cried\" unto God in their trouble, and made supplication to him more earnestly, more heartily, than ever before. We need not suppose that they had previously fallen away from their faith, and \"now at last returned to God after many years of idolatrous aberration\" (Aben Ezra, Kalisch). But there was among them an access of religious fervour; they \"turned to God\" from a state of deadness, rather from one of alienation, and raised a \"cry\" of the kind to which he is never deaf. God therefore \"heard their groaning,\" deigned to listen to their prayers, and commenced the course of miraculous action which issued in the Exodus. (This section is more closely connected with what follows than with what went before, and would better begin ch. 3. than terminate ch. 2.) Verse 23. - In process of time. Literally, \"in those many days.\" The reign of Rameses II. was exceptionally long, as previously explained. He had already reigned twenty-seven years when Moses fled from him (Exodus 2:15). He had now reigned sixty-seven, and Moses was eighty! It had seemed a weary while to wait. The children of Israel sighed. If the time had seemed a weary while to Moses, how much more to his nation! He had escaped and was in Midian - they toiled on in Egypt. He kept sheep - they had their lives made \"bitter\" for them \"with hard bondage, in molter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field\" (Exodus 1:14). He could bring up his sons in safety; their sons were still thrown into the river. No wonder that \"an exceeding bitter cry\" went up to God from the oppressed people, so soon as they found that they had nothing to hope from the new king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - God heard their groaning. God is said to \"hear\" the prayers which he accepts and grants; to \"be deaf\" to those which he does not grant, but rejects. He now \"heard\" (i.e. accepted) the supplications of oppressed Israel; and on account of the covenant which he had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - a covenant always remembered by him - he looked upon his people, made them the objects of his special regard, and entered on a course, which was abnormal, irregular, miraculous, in order to carry out his purposes of mercy towards them It is observed that anthropomorphic expressions are here accumulated; but this is always the case when the love and tenderness of God towards man are spoken of, since they form the only possible phraseology in which ideas of love and tenderness can be expressed so as to be intelligible to bureau beings. And God regarded them.

The natural place for a description of the altar of incense - part of the furniture of the holy place (ver. 6) - would seem to have been Exodus 25:10-40, where we have the descriptions of the ark, the mercy-seat, the table of shew-bread, and the candlestick; the natural place for \"the ransom of souls,\" the earlier part of the same chapter (ver. 3), where the silver is required which was to be collected in this way; the natural place for an account of the bronze laver, ch. 27, where the bronze altar, near which it stood, is described; the natural place for the composition of the holy oil, ch. 29, where its use is commanded (vers. 7, 21); and the natural place for a description of the perfume the same as for the altar on which it was to be offered. Whether Moses made the omissions in writing his record, and afterwards supplied them in the present chapter, or whether Divine wisdom saw fit to give the directions in the order in which we now have them, cannot be determined. Hitherto certainly no sufficient reason has been shown for the existing order, which hence appears accidental. The altar of incense was to be in many respects similar to the altar of burnt-offering, but of smaller size and richer material. Both were to be \"four-square,\" and both of shittim wood cased with metal; but the former was to be taller, the latter shorter, than it was broad; and while the latter was to be cased with bronze, the former was to have a covering of gold. The place for the altar of incense was the main chamber of the tabernacle, a little in front of the veil; and its purpose was, as the name implied, the offering of incense to almighty God. This was to be done by the officiating priest, twice a day, morning and evening, and in practice was performed before the morning, and after the evening sacrifice. Verse 1 - An altar to burn incense upon. The offering of incense was an element in the religious worship of most ancient nations. In Egypt frankincense was especially used in the festivals of the god Ammon (Records of the Past, vol. 10. pp. 18, 19);. and on one occasion an Egyptian sovereign sent a naval expedition to Arabia for the express purpose of bringing frankincense and frankincense trees to Egypt, in connection with the Ammon feasts (Brugsch, History of Egypt, vol. 1. pp. 305-311). The Babylonians burnt a thousand talents' weight of frankincense every year at the great festival of Bal (Herod. 1:183). The Greeks and Romans offered frankincense, as a rule, with every offering; and in the early ages of Christianity it was made the test of a Christian whether he would do this or no. What exactly the religious notion was which underlay these acts, or whether it was the same everywhere, may be questioned. In the Mosaic religion, however, there can be little doubt that, in the main, incense symbolised prayer. (See Psalm 141:2; Luke 1:10.) Of shittim wood. Compare above, Exodus 27:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Four square shall it be. Like the altar of burnt-offering. See the comment on Exodus 27:1. Two cubits shall be the height thereof. Altars of this small size are often represented on ancient vases and other remains. (See Dr. Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, pp. 117 and 1174.) The horns thereof. It seems to be assumed that an altar must have horns. Those of the altar of incense were to have the blood of certain sin-offerings smeared upon them (Leviticus 4:7, 18). Shall be of the same - i.e. \"shall be of one piece with the top of the table\" - not projections added to it. Compare Exodus 27:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold - i.e., a border, or moulding, all round the top, to prevent anything from falling off. Compare what is said of the table of shew-bread, Exodus 25:24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - By the two corners. Rather, \"on its two sides.\" The ensuing clause is redundant. All that is meant is, that the altar should have two rings only - not four - one at each side, directly below the moulding. As it was so small, two rings were enough. For the staves. Rather, \"for staves.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The staves were to be of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, like those used for carrying the ark (Exodus 25:13) and the table of shew-bread (ib, 28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Thou shalt put it before the vail. It might have been doubtful from what is said here, which side of the veil the altar was to be placed. The doubt is precluded by the narrative of what Moses actually did in Exodus 40:21-29, which makes it clear that the altar was placed with the golden candlestick and the table of shew-bread, outside the veil, in the \"holy place,\" and not within the \"holy of holies.\" Where I will meet with thee. See above, Exodus 25:22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Sweet incense. Literally, \"incense of perfumes.\" For the composition of the incense, see vers. 34-38. When he dresseth the lamps. The lamps of the golden candlestick were to be trimmed and cleaned, their wicks looked to, and fresh oil added, if necessary, every morning, immediately after daybreak. See the comment on Exodus 27:21. The duty devolved on the priests.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - At even. Literally, \"between the two evenings.\" (See the comment on Exodus 12:6.) The offering of incense by the high priest twice a day, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifice, indicated that prayer was needed as constantly as expiation, and that neither might for a single day be intermitted. A perpetual incense. \"Perpetual,\" in the sense that it was to be burnt twice a day, as long as the religion lasted - not in the sense that it was to be kept burning constantly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - By strange incense is meant any which was not prepared according to the directions given in vers. 34-38. None such was ever to be offered. Nor was the altar to be used for burnt-offering, meat-offering, or drink-offering. For burnt-offering it was manifestly unfit; but the prohibition of the others seems to show a determination to keep its use markedly distinct from that of the brazen altar in the court, which was to receive all that was offered either for expiation, or for self-dedication, or in gratitude. On the sole exception made to this general law, see the comment on the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in the year. Once in the year, on the great day of atonement - the tenth day of the seventh month - the high priest, after burning incense within the veil, and sprinkling the blood of a bullock and a ram towards the mercy seat, was to take of the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar of incense \"to make an atonement for it - to cleanse it and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel\" (Leviticus 16:18, 19). This was not making it an altar of expiation, but merely expiating it. There was, however, another use for the altar, where it seems to have served for an altar of expiation. When the high priest had sinned in his official character, and offered a sin-offering for his cleansing (Leviticus 4:3-12), or when the whole congregation had committed an offence through inadvertence, and did the same (ib, 13-21), the high priest was to put of the blood of the sacrifice on the horns of the altar of incense, \"for the expiation of his own sin and the sin of the people\" (Keil). In these two cases, the altar of incense served the purpose of the altar of burnt-offering, on which was put the blood of private sin-offerings (ib, 22-35). It is most holy. There seems to be sufficient reason for considering the altar of incense as, next to the ark and mercy seat, the most sacred object in the furniture of the tabernacle. This precedence indicates the extreme value which God sets upon prayer.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 30:11-16NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-16. - THE RANSOM OF SOULS. The various commands given with respect to the tabernacle and its furniture would necessarily involve a very considerable outlay; and it was important that Moses should receive directions as to the source, or sources, whence this expenditure was to come. In Exodus 25:2-7, one source had been indicated, viz., the voluntary contributions of the people. To this is now added a second source. On occasion of rite numbering of the people - an event which is spoken of as impending (ver. 12) - Moses was told to exact from each of them, as atonement money, the sum of half a shekel of silver. The produce of this tax was to be applied to the work of the sanctuary (ver. 16), and it is found to have formed an important clement in the provision for the cost, since the total amount was above a hundred talents, or, more exactly, 301,775 shekels (Exodus 38:25). The requirement of atonement money seems to have been based on the idea, that formal enrolment in the number of God's faithful people necessarily brought home to every man his unworthiness to belong to that holy company, and so made him feel the need of making atonement in some way or other. The payment of the half-shekel was appointed as the legal mode under those circumstances. It was an acknowledgment of sin, equally binding upon all, and so made equal for all; and it saved from God's vengeance those who, if they had boon too proud to make it, would have been punished by some \"plague\" or other (ver. 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - When thou takest the sum. The sum had been taken roughly at the time of the exodus (Exodus 12:37). Moses was now, it would seem, about to take it again, more accurately. No command had ever been given that the people should not be numbered; and the Egyptian habit of compiling exact statistics naturally clung to one who had had an Egyptian training. (See the \"Statistical Tables of Karnak,\" in the \"Records of the Past,\" vol. 2. pp. 19-28.) A ransom. Rather \"an expiation,\" \"an atonement\" - (as in Exodus 29:33, 36) - something to show that he was conscious of sin, and of his not deserving to be numbered among God's people. That there was no plague. \"That they be not punished for undue pride and presumption. There is no thought of such a plague as was provoked by David's numbering (2 Samuel 24:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Half a shekel. The shekel of later times was a silver coin, about the size round of our shilling, but considerably thicker, and worth about one shilling and eightpence. But at the date of the exodus coins were unknown, and the \"shekel\" meant a certain weight. The burthen imposed by the tax was evidently a light one. The shekel of the sanctuary. A standard weight in the possession of the priests, equal probably to about 220 grains troy. Twenty gerahs. The word \"gerah\" means \"a bean;\" and the gerah must bare been a weight equal to about eleven grains troy, It remained in use to the time of the captivity (Ezekiel 45:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - From twenty years old and upward. Twenty was the age at which an Israelite was reckoned a man; at twenty he became liable to serve in the wars (2 Chronicles 25:5), and entered otherwise on the duties of citizenship. At twenty the Levites began their service in the temple (1 Chronicles 23:24, 27; 2 Chronicles 31:17; Ezra 3:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less. This is very emphatic testimony to the equal value of souls in God's sight. The payment was \"the ransom of a soul\" (ver. 12) - an acknowledgment of God's mercy in sparing those whose life was justly forfeit. As each soul that he has created is equally precious in his sight, and as he designs equally the salvation of all - it was fitting that the same exact sum should be paid in every case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The application of the \"atonement money\" is stated more distinctly in Exodus 38:27, 28. It was employed for the silver sockets that supported the boards of the tabernacle, and for the hooks, capitals, and connecting rods of the pillars which surrounded the court. Thus employed, it was a continual \"memorial\" in the eyes of the people, reminding each man of his privileges and dutiesNEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-21. - THE BRAZEN LAVER. That the tabernacle was to have an ample supply of water had been implied in the directions given for the washing of Aaron and his sons at its outer door (Exodus 29:4). That it would contain some provision of the kind is further indicated by the command to \"wash the inwards\" of victims (ib, 17). We have now, in this place, the special directions given to Moses on the subject. He was to provide a brazen, or rather a bronze laver, which was to stand on a separate \"foot,\" or base, of bronze, in the court of the tabernacle, between the entrance to the tabernacle and the \"brazen altar.\" This was to be kept constantly supplied with water, and was to furnish whatever might be needed for the various ceremonies. Among its other uses, it was to supply liquid for the constant ablution of the priests, who were to wash both their hands and their feet on every occasion of their entering the sacred tent, and even on every occasion of their ministering at the brazen altar (ver. 20). This law was to be \"a statute for ever\" (ver. 21), and its violation was to be punished by death.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18 - A laver. It is remarkable that nothing is said respecting either the shape or the size of the laver. In 1 Kings we have an elaborate description of the \"molten sea,\" which replaced it in Solomon's temple, as well as an almost equally elaborate one of ten other layers made by Hiram, Solomon's artist, at the same time. We may perhaps assume from these examples that the brazen laver of the tabernacle was a large bronze vase or basin, standing upon a stem, which was fixed into a base. It was probably fitted up with an apparatus of taps and cocks. Between the tabernacle .... and the altar. The Rabbinical commentators say that it was not exactly in the middle, but a little towards the south side.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19 Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet. Ablution by clear fresh water is so plain and simple a type of purity as to have been used in almost all religions. The hands and the feet would designate symbolically all a man's active doings, and even his whole walk in life - his \"goings out\" and his \"comings in,\" in the phraseology of the Hebrews. There would also be a special practical need for such ablutions in the case of persons who were employed about bloody sacrifices, who slew the victims, sprinkled, the blood, and even dashed it against the base of the altar. On some rare occasions the priests were required to bathe their whole persons, and not their hands and feet only (see above, ch. 29:4; and below, Leviticus 16:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20 - That they die not. Compare Exodus 28:35 and 43. Contempt of the simple and easy regulation to wash at the laver would imply contempt of purity itself; and so an entire hypocrisy of life and character, than which nothing could be a greater offence to God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21- It shall be a statute for ever. Compare Exodus 27:21; Exodus 28:43; Exodus 29:9: etNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-33. - THE HOLY OIL. The composition of the oil required for anointing the priests (Exodus 29:7), the altar (ib, 36), the tabernacle itself (ver. 26), and its furniture (vers. 27, 28), was a necessary matter for Moses to know, and is now declared with much minuteness; the exact weight of each spice, and the exact quantity of the olive oil being given (vers. 23, 240. Directions are added for its use (vers. 26-30): and finally, a warning is given against its application to any persons except the priests, or its composition for any other purpose besides the use of the sanctuary (vers. 31-33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23 - Principal spices. The ancients recognised a vast variety of spices. Pliny notices an ointment which was composed of twenty-six ingredients, chiefly spices (H.N. 13:2, § 18). Herodotus mentions five \"principal spices\" as furnished by Arabia (3:107), of which four seem to be identical with those employed in the holy oil. Pure myrrh. Literally, \"myrrh of freedom,\" or \"freely flowing myrrh.\" The shrub which yields myrrh (Balsamodendron myrrha) produces two kinds - one, which exudes spontaneously, and is regarded as the best (Plin. II. 4:12:35; Theophrast. De Odoribus, § 29); and another, of inferior quality, which flows from incisions made in the bark. It is the former kind which is here intended. Myrrh was among the ancients in high request as a spice. It was used by the Egyptians for embalming (Herod 2:86), in Persia as an odour (Athen. Deipn, 12. p. 514, A); by the Greeks for incense (Soph. Fr. 340) and in unguents (Aristoph Eq 1. 1332); by the later Jews in funerals (John 19:39); and was largely exported from Arabia and Ethiopia into various parts of Asia and Europe. Sweet cinnamon. Cinnamon was a far rarer spice than myrrh. It is only mentioned three times in the Old Testament (cf. Proverbs 7:16; Song of Solomon 4:14). I am not aware of any trace of it in Egypt; but Herodotus says that it was obtained by the Greeks from Arabia in his day (3:111). It is the inner bark or rind of a tree allied to the laurel, and called by some Laurus cinnamomum, by others Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The tree now grows only in India on the Malabar coast, in Ceylon, Borneo, Sumatra, Cochin China, and China. If its habitat has not suffered contraction, we must regard the mention of it here as indicative of a very early commerce of a very extensive character. Sweet calamus. Aromatic reeds, probably of several distinct kind, seem to have been the produce anciently of Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and India. It is impossible to say what exactly was the species here intended. Calamus is mentioned as a spice in Isaiah 43:24; Jeremiah 6:20; Ezekiel 27:17; and Song of Solomon 4:14; but the term used (kaneh, \"cane \") is vague; and it is not at all clear that one species only is alluded to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24 - Cassia. The modern cassia is the inner bark of a tree distinct from the cinnamon tree, known to botanists as Cinnamo-mum cassia, which is a native of India, Java, and the Malay peninsula. In taste and scent, it \"bears a strong resemblance to cinnamon, but is more pungent and of coarser texture\" (Cook). It is uncertain, however, if this is the spice here indicated. The Hebrew word used is kiddah, not ketsioth (as in Psalm 45:8); and it is very doubtful whether the two are identical On the shekel of the sanctuary. see the comment on ver. 13; and on the kin, see Exodus 29:40.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25- An oil of holy ointment. Literally, \"an oil of holy anointing,\" or \"a holy anointing oil,\" as our translators render in ver. 31, and also in the last clause of the present verse. Exodus 30:26NEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-29 - Thou shalt anoint the tabernacle. The first application of the holy oil was to be to the inanimate objects constituting the paraphernalia of worship - viz.,NEWLINENEWLINE1. The tabernacle itself as a whole;NEWLINENEWLINE2. The furniture of the holy of holies - the ark and mercy seat;NEWLINENEWLINE3. The furniture of the holy place - the show-bread table, the candlestick, and the altar of incense; andNEWLINENEWLINE4. The furniture of the court - the altar of burnt-offering, and the laver. After applying the oil to these, Moses was to proceed to the anointing of the priests.

The tent, the ark, the table, the candlestick, the altar of incense, the brazen altar, the laver, and its base, each and all were to be touched with the holy oil, and thereby formally dedicated to God's service (Leviticus 8:10, 11), and then at last was Moses to \"pour of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anoint him, to sanctify him\" (ib, 12). So God constantly prepares men's spheres for them before he inducts them into their spheres. Even in the next world our Blessed Lord \"prepares places for us.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUpon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32 - Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured - i.e., \"it shall not be used by any privately as a mere unguent, but shall be reserved wholly for sacred purposes.\" Neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it. Rather, \"after its proportion.\" The Israelites were not forbidden the use of the different materials in their unguents, or even the combination of the same materials, provided they varied the proportions. The object is simply that the holy oil should remain a thing separate and apart, never applied to any but a holy use.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33- Upon a stranger.

It remained to give directions concerning the composition of the incense, which, according to verse 7, was to be burnt upon the altar of gold. That it was to be of one and one only peculiar kind had been already implied in the prohibition to burn \"strange incense\" (ver. 9). Moses is now told exactly how it was to be composed. As the oil was to contain four spices, so was the incense to be made of a like number - stacte, onycha, galbanum, and frankincense - of each the same quantity (ver. 34). The art of the apothecary was to be called in for making it up (ver. 35). A portion of it was to be \"beaten very small,\" and placed in front of the ark of the covenant, probably on the golden altar outside the vail (ver. 36). A prohibition is added, similar to that given with respect to the holy oil: no one is to make any like it for private use, under pain of being \"cut off from his people\" (vers. 37, 38). Verse 34. - Take unto thee sweet spices. Rather, \"Take unto thee spices,\" or \"perfumes.\" The word has no epithet. Stacte. The Hebrew word used means simply \"a drop\" (Job 32:27), and might be applied to any gum or resin which exuded from a tree. We have no clue to the gum here intended but that which is furnished by the rendering of the LXX., στακτή, which our translators have followed. Now the Greeks seem to have called two gums by this name - one, the natural exudation from the myrrh tree, called above (ver. 23) \"pure myrrh,\" or \"the myrrh that flows freely;\" and the other gum storax. As it is not likely that the same substance has been given two names within the space of ten verses, we must suppose the latter to be meant. Gum storax is the produce of a tree allied to the poplar, and known as Styrax officinalis, which grows abundantly in Syria and Palestine. It was frequently used as a perfume by the ancients (Herod. 3:107; Plin. H. N. 12:17, §40). Onycha. The Hebrew word, she-kheleth, seems to mean a \"shell\" of some kind or other. The Greek ὄνυξ, Lat. onycha, was applied to the operculum - the \"nail\" or \"claw\" - of certain shell-fish of the genus Strombidae, which were common in the lied Sea, and elsewhere. The particular strombus which furnishes the onycha of the ancients is thought to have been the Unguis odoratus or Blatta Byzantina. The opercula of these shell-fish have, when burnt, a strong odour, \"something like castoreum.\" The onycha is, again coupled with galbanum and gum storax in Ecclesiates 24:15. Galbanum. The Hebrew word khelb'nah, is so near the Greek χαλβάιη and the Latin galbanum that it has with good reason been assumed to designate the same substance. Galbanum is a gum well known both to ancients and moderns. It is admitted into the pharmacopeia. Several plants seem to produce it, as the Opoidia galbanifera, the Galbanum Persicum, and a plant which grows in Northern Persia, very like the Ferula erubeseens. When burnt, galbanum has a strong pungent odour, which is said to be disagreeable by itself, but to improve and preserve other odours (Plin. H. N. 12:54). Frankincense. On the wide use of frankincense, see the comment on ver. 1. It was the produce of a tree which anciently flourished in Arabia, but which appears to have degenerated, and now produces only an inferior quality. The best frankincense comes now from the high lands of India. It exudes from a tree called salai (the Boswellia setrata or thurifera of botanists). Some think that the frankincense exported largely from Arabia to the neighbouring nations was in part the produce of this tree imported by the Arab merchants from Hindustan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus30:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - A confection after the art of the apothecary. Like the holy oil, the incense was to be artistically compounded by one accustomed to deal with such ingredients. It was actually, in the first instance, the work of Bezaleel (Exodus 27:29). Tempered together. This translation is supported by the authority of the Septuagint and the Vulgate, and is defended by Canon Cook. But the mass of modern critics is in favour of the translation \"salted,\" or \"with salt.\" (So Buxtorf, Gesenius, De Wette, Kalisch, Keil, etc.) If, nobel suggests \"comminuted,\" identifying malakh with marakh.

This is against Knobel's rendering of malakh, which would imply that all was broken into small pieces. A certain portion only was to be thus prepared from time to time and placed ready for offering. It was to be put before the testimony - i.e., opposite the m-k, but outside the vail.

The directions for the construction of the tabernacle and its furniture being now complete, and the composition of the holy oil and the holy incense having been laid down minutely, it only remained to designate the persons to whom the oversight of the work was to be especially entrusted. These were to be two - Bezaleel, of the tribe of Judah, as head and chief; Aholiab, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant. There can be no doubt that they were selected, primarily, as already possessing superior artistic powers and acquirements; but in appointing them God promised an infusion of special wisdom and knowledge, so that they were at once naturally and supernaturally fitted for their task. It is important to note that artistic ability is thus distinctly recognised as being quite as much a gift of God as any other, and indeed as coming to man through the Spirit of God (ver. 3). Artistic excellence is not a thing to be despised. It is very capable of abuse; but in itself it is a high gift, bestowed by God on a few only, with the special intent that it should be used to his honour and glory - not indeed in his direct service only - but always so as to improve, elevate, refine mankind, and thus help towards the advancement of God's kingdomNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSee, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I have called by name. God \"calls by name\" only those whom he appoints to some high office, as Moses (Exodus 3:4; Exodus 33:12), Cyrus (Isaiah 45:3, 4), and here Bezaleel and Aholiab. He honours us highly in even condescending to \"know us by name,\" still more in \"calling\" us. Bezaleel is traced to Judah in Chronicles through five ancestors - Uri, Hur, Caleb, Hezron, and Pharez, Judah's son by Tamar. The genealogy, though less contracted than most of those in Exodus, probably contains two or three omissions. The son of Hur. Hur, the grandfather of Bezaleel, is thought to be the person mentioned in Exodus 17:10, and Exodus 24:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The Spirit of God. There is no article in the Hebrew, any more than in Genesis 1:1; and some would therefore translate \"a Divine Spirit\"; but no change is needed. Ruakh elohim contains in itself the idea of singularity, since God has but one Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the medium of communication whereby God the Father bestows all gifts upon us. In wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge. By the first of these terms is meant the power to invent and originate; by the second ability to receive and appreciate directions and suggestions; by the third, such information as is acquired by experience and acquaintance with facts. Bezaleel was to have all these, and, in addition, was to be wise in all manner of workmanship; i.e. - to possess manual dexterity, the power of artistic execution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - The result of these gifts would be to enable him - 1.

It has been said that \"as everything that had to be done was prescribed in strict and precise detail, there was to be no exercise of original powers of invention nor of taste\" (Cook); but this was scarcely so. The forms of the cherubim, the patterns to be woven into the stuffs, or embroidered on them, the shapes of the vessels, of the capitals of the pillars, and of the laver were not prescribed in the directions. Bezaleel and Aholiab would have had to design them after such a description as Moses could give of the \"pattern\" which he had seen in the mount. In doing this, there would be much room for the exercise of inventive power and taste.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - In cutting of stones - i.e., \"in Genesis-curling.\" The fabric of the tabernacle was entirely of metal, cloth, and wood.

Yet the Danites were in general rather warlike and rude than artistic (Genesis 49:17; Deuteronomy 33:22; Judges 13:2; Judges 18:11, 27). In the hearts of all that are wise hearted have I put wisdom. \"Unto him that hath shall be given.

Various reasons have been given for this recurrence to the sanctity of the sabbath. Kurtz connects it with the giving of the two tables, in which \"the law of the sabbath held a particularly prominent place.\" Kalisch and others view it rather as the sequel to the directions concerning the tabernacle, and as designed to teach \"that the holy service in the tabernacle could not supersede the observance of the sabbath, but derived front that observance its true value.\" A third set of critics regard the recurrence to the subject as purely practical - being intended to meet an immediate danger - that of the people, in their zeal to erect the tabernacle, setting sabbath observance at nought. (So Jarchi, Aben-Ezra, Clark, Rosenmuller, Canon Cook, and others.) It is to be observed, however, that the present passage is not a mere repetition. It adds to former notices (Exodus 20:8-11; Exodus 23:12) two new points: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the sabbath was to be a sign between God and Israel, a \"distinguishing badge,\" a \"sacramental bond\" (Cook); andNEWLINENEWLINE2. That its desecration was to be punished with death (ver. 15). These were supplementary points of so much importance as to furnish ample reason against their announcement being delayed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Verily. Rosenmuller suggests, \"Nevertheless.\" But there is no need for any change. It is a sign. Hitherto circumcision had been the only visible \"sign\" that the Israelites were under a special covenant with God - his people, bound to him by special ties (Genesis 17:9-14; Acts 7:8). The adoption of circumcision by the Egyptians and other nations (Herod. 2:104) had produced the effect that this \"sign\" was no longer distinguishing. It might be still\" a sign of profession \"; but it had ceased to be \"a mark of difference \"; and some other mark was therefore needed. Such the observance of the sabbath by entire abstinence from servile work became. No other nation adopted it. It continued to Roman times the mark and badge of a Jew.(Juv. Sat. 6:159; 14:96). That ye may know, etc. By keeping the sabbath day as a day of holy rest the Israelites would know - i.e., would realise severally in their own per sons, that God was their sanctifier. Sanctification would be the fruit of their obedience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death. To defile the sabbath was to do any unnecessary servile work upon it. Works of mercy, works of necessity, and works connected with religious observance were not prohibited. (See Matthew 12:1-7; Matthew 10-12.) The penalty of death for breaking the sabbath seems to moderns over-severe; but the erection of sabbath-observance into the special sacramental sign that Israel was in covenant with God made non-observance an offence of the gravest character. The man who broke the sabbath destroyed, so far as in him lay, the entire covenant between God and his people - not only broke it, but annulled it, and threw Israel out of covenant. Hence, when the sin was committed, no hesitation was felt in carrying out the law. (See Numbers 15:32-36.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The sabbath of rest. Rather, \"a sabbath.\" There were other sabbaths besides that of the seventh day (Exodus 23:11; Leviticus 25:2-12; etc.). By the expression, \"a sabbath of rest\" - literally, \"a rest of resting\" - the idea of completeness is given. Perhaps the best translation would be - \"in the seventh is complete rest.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For a perpetual covenant.

See above, ver. 13. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth. See the comment on Exodus 20:11. And was refreshed. Literally,\" and took breath.\" The metaphor is a bold one, but not bolder than others which occur in holy scripture (Psalm 44:23; Psalm 78:65). It does but carry out a little further the idea implied in God's \"resting.\" We cannot speak of any of God's acts or attributes without anthropomorphisms.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 31:18NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus31:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - THE TABLES OF TESTIMONY. It had been assumed, in the directions given for the construction of the ark, that God would give, in some material form, a document to be called \"the testimony,\" which was to be laid up inside it (Exodus 25:16). It is not too much to say that the tabernacle, with its various appurtenances, was constructed for this purpose; the rest of the tabernacle was designed with a view to the holy of holies the holy of holies was designed as a receptacle for the ark - and the ark was designed as a receptacle for the tables of testimony. This section could, therefore, scarcely be concluded without some definite account of the document which was to give the ark and the tabernacle itself, its main significance. Verse 18. - When he had made an end of communing. Literally, \"when he had finished speaking.\" Two tables. Rather, \"the two tables\" - i.e., the tables promised when he went up into the mount (Exodus 24:12). Of stone. Stone was the ordinary material on which Egyptian documents were engraved, both at the time of the Exodus, and before and after. They were, however, for the most part, either inscribed upon the natural rock, or engraved on the walls of temples or tombs. Inscriptions upon slabs of stone are rare, more especially in the early times, and would scarcely have occurred to Moses himself. Written with the finger of God - i.e., \"inscribed supernaturally\" - not cut by any human hand. Compare Exodus 32:16. It is idle to speculate on the exact mode of the Divine operation.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.32":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-6. - THE IDOLATRY OF THE GOLDEN CALF. During the absence of Moses in Mount Sinai, an absence of nearly six weeks, the Israelites grew impatient, and regarding their leader as lost to them, and the Divine Presence which they had hitherto enjoyed as lost with him, insisted on having a symbol of that presence made for them, which should henceforth go in front of the host and so lead them on in their journeyings. It would seem that the pillar of the cloud, which had gone before them from Succoth to Sinai, was now removed from the camp, and resting upon the \"mount\" where Moses was (Exodus 24:15). Under these circumstances they wanted a visible tangible something, in which they could regard the Divine Presence as resting, and whereto they might offer worship and sacrifice (ver. 8). They therefore went to Aaron, whom Moses had bid them consult in any difficulty (Exodus 24:14), and requested him to \"make them a god.\" Aaron had not the courage to meet this request with a plain negative. As Augustine and Theodoret conjecture with much probability, he sought to turn them from their purpose by asking them to give up those possessions which he conceived that they most valued - viz, the personal ornaments of their wives and children. But he had miscalculated the strength of their fanaticism. The people immediately complied - the ornaments were brought in - and Aaron was compelled, either to fly from his word, or to lend himself to the people's wishes. He did the latter. Either looking to Egypt for a pattern, or falling back on some old form of Syrian or Chaldaean idolatry (see the comment on ver. 4), he melted down the gold and cast it into the form of a calf. The \"god\" being thus made, an altar was built to it (ver. 5) and sacrifice offered (ver 6). Such was the condition of affairs when Moses, having just received the two tables of stone, was warned by God of what had occurred, and bidden to descend from Sinai. Verse 1. - The people saw that Moses delayed to come down. He had been absent, probably, above a month. It was the first day of their worship when he descended; and a week would suffice for the collection of the ornaments, the formation of the mould, and the casting of the idol. Unto Aaron. It is not clear why no mention is made of Hur, who had been made co-regent with Aaron (Exodus 24:14); but perhaps Aaron was known to be the weaker of the two. Up, make us gods. Most moderns translate\" a god.\" But the word is vague, and the speakers did not themselves perhaps care whether one idol was made or more. Which shall go before us. The Israelites were apparently tired of their long delay at Sinai, and were anxious to proceed upon their journey. They wanted a visible god at their head, to give them confidence and courage. Compare 1 Samuel 4:3-8. We wot not what is become of him. He might, they thought, be dead - he might have returned to Egypt - he might be going to stay always with God in the mount which they did not dare to approach. At any rate, he was lost to them, and they might never see him again.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Break off. \"Take off\" would perhaps be a better translation. The ear-rings would not require any breaking. They were penannular, and could be removed by a smart pull. Your wives, your sons, and your daughters. See the comment on Exodus 3:22. It is implied that the men did not wear earrings. At an earlier date the household of Jacob, chiefly men, had worn them (Genesis 35:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All the people broke off the golden ear-rings. Thus, as is supposed, disappointing Aaron, who had counted on the refusal of the women to part with their finery, and the reluctance of the men to compel them. Had ear-rings been still regarded as amulets (Genesis 1.s.c.) it is not likely that they would have been so readily given up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And fashioned it with a graving tool. Rather, \"and bound it (the gold) in a bag.\" Compare 2 Kings 5:23, where the same two Hebrew words occur in the same sense. It is impossible to extract from the original the sense given in the Authorised Version, since the simple copula van cannot mean \"after.\" When two verbs in the same tense are conjoined by van \"and,\" the two actions must be simultaneous, or the latter follow the former. But the calf cannot have been graven first, and then molten. It is objected to the rendering, \"he bound it in a bag,\" that that action is so trivial that it would be superfluous to mention it (Keil). But it is quite consonant with the simplicity of Scripture to mention very trivial circumstances. The act of putting up in bags is mentioned both here and also in 2 Kings 5:23, and 2 Kings 12:9. They said. The fashioners of the image said this. These be thy gods. Rather, \"This is thy God.\" Why Aaron selected the form of the calf as that which he would present to the Israelites to receive their worship, has been generally explained by supposing that his thoughts reverted to Egypt, and found in the Apis of Memphis or the Mnevis of Hellopolis the pattern which he thought it best to follow. But there are several objections to this view.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The Egyptian gods had just been discredited by their powerlessness being manifested - it was an odd time at which to fly to them.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Apis and Mnevis were not molten calves, but live bulls. If the design had been to revert to Egypt, would not a living animal have been selected?NEWLINENEWLINE3. The calf when made was not viewed as an image of any Egyptian god, but as a representation of Jehovah (ver. 5).NEWLINENEWLINE4. The Israelites are never taxed with having worshipped the idols of Egypt anywhere else than in Egypt (Joshua 24:14; Ezekiel 20:8; Ezekiel 23:3). To us it seems probable that Aaron reverted to an earlier period than the time of the sojourn in Egypt, that he went back to those \"gods on the other side of the flood,\" which Joshua warned the Israelites some sixty years later, to \"put away\" (Joshua l.s.c.). The subject is one too large for discussion here; but may not the winged and human-headed bull, which was the emblem of divine power from a very early date in Babylon, have retained a place in the recollections of the people in all their wanderings, and have formed a portion of their religions symbolism? May it not have been this conception which lay at the root of the cherubic forms, and the revival of which now seemed to Aaron the smallest departure from pure monotheism with which the people would be contented?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - He built an altar before it. Aaron thus proceeded to \"follow a multitude to evil\" (Exodus 23:2), and encouraged the idolatry which he felt himself powerless to restrain. Still, he did not intend that the people should drift away from the worship of Jehovah, or view the calf as anything but a symbol of him. He therefore made proclamation and said, Tomorrow is a feast to the Lord (literally, \"to Jehovah \").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They rose up early on the morrow. The people were like a child with a new toy. They could scarcely sleep for thinking of it. So, as soon as it was day, they left their beds, and hastened to begin the new worship Burnt offerings and peace offerings. It is evident that both of these were customary forms of sacrifice - neither of them first introduced by the Law, which had not - except so far as the \"Book of the Covenant\" was concerned - been promulgated. Compare Jethro's offerings (Exodus 18:12). The people sat down to eat and drink. A feast almost always followed upon a sacrifice, only certain portions of the victim being commonly burnt, while the rest was consumed by the offerers. See the comment on Exodus 18:12. And rose up to play. This \"play\" was scarcely of a harmless kind. The sensualism of idol-worship constantly led on to sensuality; and the feasts upon idol-sacrifices terminated in profligate orgies of a nature which cannot be described. See the application of the passage by St. Paul in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 10:7), and compare verse Exodus 32:25NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 32:7-14NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-14. - THE INTERCESSION OF MOSES. Moses, in Sinai, was so far removed from the camp, and the cloud so shut out his vision of it, that he had neither seen nor heard anything unusual, and was wholly ignorant of what had happened, until God declared it to him (ver. 7, 8). After declaring it, God announced his intention of destroying the people for their apostasy, and fulfilling his promise to Abraham by raising up a \"great nation\" out of the seed of Moses (ver. 10). No doubt this constituted a great trial of the prophet's character. He might, without sin, have acquiesced in the punishment of the people as deserved, and have accepted the promise made to himself as a fresh instance of God's goodness to him. There would have been nothing wrong in this; but it would have shown that he fell short of the heroic type, belonged to the ordinary run of mortals, was of the common \"delf,\" not of \"the precious porcelain of human clay.\" God's trial of him gave him an opportunity of rising above this; and he responded to it. From the time that he reached full manhood (Exodus 2:11) he had cast in his lot with his nation; he had been appointed their leader (Exodus 3:10); they had accepted him as such (Exodus 4:31); he had led them out of Egypt and brought them to Sinai; if he had looked coldly on them now, and readily separated his fate from theirs, he would have been false to his past, and wanting in tenderness towards those who were at once his wards and his countrymen. His own glory naturally drew him one way, his affection for Israel the other. It is to his eternal honour that he chose the better part; declined to be put in Abraham's place, and generously interceded for his nation (vers. 11-13). He thereby placed himself among the heroes of humanity, and gave additional strength and dignity to his own character. Verse 7. - Go, descend - i.e., \"make haste to descend - do not tarry - there is need of thy immediate presence.\" Thy people, which thou broughtest, etc. Words calculated to awaken the tenderness between which and self-love the coming struggle was to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - They have turned aside quickly. A few weeks have sufficed to make them forget their solemn pledges (Exodus 19:8; Exodus 24:3), and fly in the face of a plain unmistakable commandment. A molten calf. In the contemptuous language of Holy Scripture when speaking of idols, such an emblematic figure as the Babylonion man-bull would be a mere \"calf.\" That the figure made by Aaron is called always \"a molten calf\" - literally, \"a calf of fusion\" - disposes of the theory of Keil, that it was of carved wood covered with gold plates hammered on to it. These be thy gods, which have brought thee. Rather, \"This is thy god, which has brought thee.\" The plural must be regarded as merely one of dignity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9.- A stiffnecked people. This epithet, which becomes epitheton usitatum, is here used for the first time.

This was not a command, but rather a suggestion; or, at any rate, it was a command not intended to compel obedience - like that of the angel to Jacob - \"Let me go, for the day breaketh\" (Genesis 32:26). Moses was not intended to take the command as absolute. He did not do so - he \"wrestled with God,\" like Jacob, and prevailed. That my wrath may wax hot. Literally, \"and my wrath will wax hot.\" I will make of thee a great nation. (Compare Numbers 14:12.) God could, of course, have multiplied the seed of Moses, as he had that of Abraham; but in that case all that had been as yet done would have gone for nought, and his purposes with respect to his \"peculiar people\" would have been put back six hundred years and more.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - Moses has three pleas wherewith he \"wrestles with God:\" -NEWLINENEWLINE1.

Egypt will be triumphant if Israel is swept away, and will misapprehend the Divine action.NEWLINENEWLINE3. The promises made to Abraham (Genesis 15:5; Genesis 17:2-6; etc.), Isaac (Genesis 26:4), and Jacob (Genesis 28:14; Genesis 35:11), which had received a partial fulfilment, would seem to be revoked and withdrawn if the nation already formed were destroyed and a fresh start made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth?

Changes of purpose are, of course, attributed to God by an \"economy,\" or accommodation of the truth to human modes of speech and conception. \"God is not a man that he should repent.\" He \"knows the end from the beginning.\" When he threatened to destroy Israel, he knew that he would spare; but, as he communicated to Moses, first, his anger, and then, at a later period, his intention to spare, he is said to have \"repented.\" The expression is an anthropomorphic one, like so many others, on which we have already commented. (See the comment on Exodus 2:24, 25; 3:7, 8; 31:17; etc.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 32:15-19NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15-19. - MOSES BREAKS THE TWO TABLES. The entire conference between God and Moses being now ended, Moses hastened to descend from the mount, and interpose in the crisis that had arisen, he took carefully the two tables of stone, which he had received, in his two hands (Deuteronomy 9:15), and set out on his return to the camp. On the way, he fell in with Joshua, who must have been on the watch for his descent, and the two proceeded together. When a certain portion of the distance had been traversed, the sounds of the festivity which was going on in the camp reached their ears; and Joshua, mistaking the nature of the shouts, suggested that fighting was in progress (ver. 17). Moses, however, better instructed in the actual nature of the proceedings (vers. 7, 8), caught their character more correctly, and declared that what he heard was nothing but shouting (ver. 18). Soon afterwards, the camp came into sight - a disorderly crowd, half stripped of their garments (ver. 25), was singing choruses and dancing round the figure which Aaron had cast - the sights and sounds were those of a dissolute orgy - Moses was struck with horror and in the frenzy of his indignation, dashed the two tables to the ground and broke them into fragments (ver. 19). The people, he felt, were utterly unworthy of the holy laws which he had brought them - they had \"altogether gone out of the way\" - they had become \"abominable\" - at the moment he perhaps despaired of obtaining mercy for them, and expected their entire destruction. God had not as yet told him whether he would \"turn from his fierce wrath,\" or not. Verse 15. - The two tables... were in his hand. In Deuteronomy 9:15, using greater particularity, Moses says that they were \"in his two hands.\" One was in each hand probably. Written on both their sides. This is the case generally with Assyrian and Babylonian tablets, but not with Egyptian ones, which are moreover scarcely found at this early date. Here we seem to have again an indication that some of the Israelitic civilisation had come to them from \"Ur of the Chaldees.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The tables were the work of God. Shaped, i.e., by the same power by which the commandments were inscribed upon them; not, necessarily, of matter newly created for the purpose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - When Joshua heard. This abrupt introduction of Joshua, who has not been mentioned for seven entire chapters, is curious. Probably he had considered himself bound, as Moses' minister (Exodus 24:13), to await his return, and had remained in the middle portion of the mount, where he may have fed upon manna, until Moses came down from the top. The noise of the people. It is noted by travellers, that in all the latter part of the descent from Sinai, the plain at its base is shut out from sight; and that sounds would be heard from it a long time before the plain itself would open on the view (Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 44). Sounds, however, which come circuitously, are always indistinct; and it is not surprising that Joshua, knowing nothing of the proceedings in the camp, should have fancied he heard a sound of war.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. This verse is difficult to translate, being markedly antithetical and at the same time idiomatic. Perhaps it would be best to render - \"It is not the voice of them who raise the cry of victory, nor is it the voice of them who raise the cry of defeat - the voice of them who raise a cry do I hear.\" The verb is the same in all the three clauses; and it would seem that Moses simply denied that there was any sound of war without making any clear suggestion as to the real character of the disturbance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The dancing. Rather \"dancing.\" There is no article; and as the subject had not been mentioned before, the use of the article would have been unmeaning. Dances were a part of the religious ceremonial in most ancient nations. Sometimes they were solemn and grave, like the choric dances of the ancient Dorians, and (probably) that of David in front of the Ark (2 Samuel 6:5-22); sometimes festive and joyous, yet not immodest, like the Pyrrhic and other dances at Sparta, and the dancing of the Salii at Rome; but more often, and especially among the Oriental nations, they were of a loose and lascivious character. In Egypt, the dancers appear to have been professionals of a degraded class, and the dancing itself to have been always sensual and indecent; while in Syria, Asia Minor, and Babylon, dancing was a wild orgy, at once licentious and productive of a species of phrenzy. We must suspect that it was this sort of dancing in which the Israelites were engaged - whence the terrible anger of Moses. He saw idolatry before his eyes, and idolatry with its worst accompaniments. In the extremity of his anger, he cast the tables out of his hands, dashed them violently against the ground, and brake them. For this act he is never reprehended. It is viewed as the natural outcome of a righteous indignation, provoked by the extreme wickedness of the people. We must bear this in mind when we come to consider the justice or injustice of the punishment which he proceeded to inflict on them for their sin (vers. 26-29).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 32:20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. MOSES DESTROYS THE GOLDEN CALF. The first vengeance which Moses took was upon the idol. It was probably hollow, and possibly of no great size. He might easily break it to pieces and subject the pieces to the action of fire, whereby they would be calcined, and might then be easily reduced to powder. This powder he caused to be mixed with the stream of the brook that flowed from Sinai, so that the Israelites were obliged to swallow with their drink particles of their own idol. Compare the action of Josiah with respect to the \"grove\" set up in the temple precincts by Manasseh (2 Kings 23:6), which was not identical, but still was similar. It has been suggested that this portion of the narrative is out of proper chronological order; and this may be so far true that the calcining and mixing with the water were at this point commanded rather than executed; but the destruction of the idol would naturally be the first thing which Moses would take in hand, and provide for, before proceeding to anything else. Only when the \"abomination\" was removed and. its destruction commenced, would he turn his attention to other points. Verse 20. - Burnt it and ground it to powder. Silver and gold subjected for a short time to a white heat, which may be easily produced by bellows, readily calcine, and are then easily crushed to a fine powder. Silver becomes detonating. I am not aware whether the case is the same with gold also. Strawed it - i.e., \"sprinkled it.\" We need not suppose Moses to have done the whole - or even any part - himself. It was enough that he directed it to be done. The water. The article shows some particular water to be meant. We learn from Deuteronomy that it was the water of \"the brook that descended out of the mount.\" Made the children of Israel drink of it. The brook being the only water readily accessible, the Israelites, if they drank at all, were compelled to risk swallowing particles of their \"god.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 32:21-24NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-24. - AARON TRIES TO EXCUSE HIMSELF. Having taken the needful steps for the destruction of the idol, Moses naturally turned upon Aaron. He had been left in charge of the people, to guide them, instruct them, counsel them in difficulties (Exodus 24:14). How had he acquitted himself of his task? He had led the people into a great sin - had at any rate connived at it - assisted in it. Moses therefore asks, \"What had the people done to him, that he should so act? How had they injured him, that he should so greatly injure them?\" To this he has no direct reply. But he will not acknowledge himself in fault - he must excuse himself. And his excuse is twofold: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. It was the people's fault, not his; they were \"set on mischief.\"NEWLINENEWLINE2. It was a fatality - he threw the gold into the fire, and \"it came out this calf.\" We are not surprised, after this, to read in Deuteronomy, that \"the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him,\" and was only hindered from his purpose by the intercession of Moses Verse 21. - What did this people unto thee? Moses does not suppose that the people had really done anything to Aaron. He asks the question as a reproach - they had done nothing to thee - had in no way injured thee - and yet thou broughtest this evil upon them. So great a sin. Literally, \"a great sin\" - the sin of idolatry. If Aaron had offered a strenuous opposition from the first, the idolatry might not have taken place - the people might have been brought to a better mind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let not the anger of my lord wax hot. Aaron's humility is extreme, and the result of a consciousness of guilt. He nowhere else addresses Moses as \"my lord.\" Set on mischief. Or \"inclined to evil\" (Kalisch).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Make us gods. Rather \"Make us a god.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - There came out this calf. Aaron speaks as if he had prepared no mould, but simply thrown the gold into the hot furnace, from which there issued forth, to his surprise, the golden calf. This was not only a suppressio veri, but a suggestio falsi. Having no even plausible defence to make, he is driven to the weakest of subterfuges.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 32:25-29NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-29. - MOSES PUNISHES THE RINGLEADERS. The presence of Moses in the camp - his impressive act in breaking the tables - even his seizure of the idol and consignment of it to destruction - did not arrest the licentious orgy in which the people had engaged before his coming. The \"play\" that had followed on the feasting still continued; though we may suppose that many had been impressed and had desisted. Moses felt that an example must be made, and a stop put to conduct which was more and more provoking the Almighty, and might at any moment bring down the judgment of complete destruction upon the whole people. He therefore took his station at the main gate of the camp (ver. 26), and shouted the words \"Who is on Jehovah's side? Here, to me!\" The sound of the words could not, of course, have reached very far - but they rallied to him those of his own tribe who stood near, and thus placed a strong force at his disposal. Moses bade them get their swords, and proceed through the camp from end to end, slaying the idolaters - not, we may be sure, indiscriminately, but executing God's judgment on those who were most conspicuous and persistent. They were especially bidden not to spare their own nearest and dearest, which implies that many Levites were among the ringleaders. The result was the destruction by the sword of three thousand men - and the suppression of the festival. It is not to be doubted that Moses had Divine sanction for what he did in this matter (ver. 27). Verse 25. - The people were naked. It has been suggested that \"licentious\" or \"unruly\" would be a better rendering (Gesenius, Dathe, Rosenmuller, Kalisch, Cook), but the primary sense of pharua is \"naked,\" \"stript;\" and of the licentious orgies of the East, stripping or uncovering the person was a feature (Herod. 2:60), so that there is no reason for changing the expression used in the Authorised Version. Moses saw that most of the people were still without the garments that they had laid aside when they began to dance, and were probably still engaged in dancing and shouting. Aaron had made them naked. Aaron is said to have done that to which his actions had led. He had made the calf and proclaimed a festival. The \"nakedness\" had naturally followed. Unto their shame among their enemies. Amalekites were no doubt still hovering about the camp; indeed, the tribe probably still held most of the surrounding mountains. They would witness the orgy, and see the indecent and shameful exposure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Moses stood in the gate of the camp. We must understand \"the principal gate,\" since the camp had several (ver. 27) Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come to me. Literally, \"Who for Jehovah? To me\" - but expressed, as the Hebrew idiom allows, in three words, forming an excellent rallying cry. All the sons of Levi - i.e., all who heard the cry. It is evident that there were Levites among the idolaters (vers. 27, 29.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Go in and out from gate to gate, etc., - i.e., \"pass through the whole camp - visit every part of it - and, where you see the licentious rites continuing, use your swords - do not spare, though the man be a brother, or a companion, or a neighbour - strike nevertheless, and bring the revel to an end.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - About three thousand. We cannot gather from this, as some have done, that the Levites who rallied to Moses were only 3,000 - for every Levite was not obliged to kill a man - but only that, when this number was slain, the idolaters desisted from their orgyNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - For Moses had said. Moses, on giving them their commission (ver. 27), had told them, that their zeal in the matter would he a consecration, and would secure them God's blessing. They earned by it the semi-priestly position, which was soon afterwards assigned to them (Numbers 3:6-13).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 32:30-35NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-35. - MOSES ONCE MORE INTERCEDES WITH GOD FOR THE PEOPLE - GOD ANSWERS HIM. No distinct reply seems to have been given to the previous intercession of Moses (vers. 11-13). He only knew that the people were not as yet consumed, and therefore that God's wrath was at any rate held in suspense. It might be that the punishment inflicted on the 3000 had appeased God's wrath: or something more might be needed. In the latter case, Moses was ready to sacrifice himself for his nation (ver. 32). Like St. Paul, he elects to be \"accursed from God, for his brethren, his kinsfolk after the flesh\" (Romans 9:3). But God will not have this sacrifice. \"The soul that sinneth, it shall die\" (Ezekiel 18:4). He declares, \"Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book\" (Exodus 32:33). Moses shall not make himself a victim. Without any such sacrifice, God will so far spare them, that they shall still go on their way towards the promised land, with Moses as their earthly, and an Angel as their heavenly leader. Only, their sin shall still be visited in God's own good time and in his own way. How, is left in obscurity; but the decree is issued - \"In the day that I visit, I will visit their sin upon them\" (ver. 34). And, writing long years after the event, the author observes - \"And God did plague the people because they made the calf which Aaron made\" (ver. 35). Verse 30. - On the morrow. The day must have been well-nigh over when the slaughter of the 3000 was completed: and after that the corpses had to be buried, the signs of carnage to be effaced, and the wounded, of whom there must have been many, cared for. Moses would have had to direct, if not even to superintend, everything, and therefore could not reascend Sinai until the next day. Moses said unto the people, Not now to the elders only, as in Exodus 24:14, but to all the people, since all had sinned, and. each man is held by God individually responsible for his own sin. Ye have sinned a great sin. One which combined ingratitude and falseness with impiety. Peradventure I shall make an atonement. Moses has formed the design, which he executes (ver. 32); but will not reveal it to the people, from modesty probably.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Gods of gold. Rather \"a god of gold.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin�; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - If thou wilt forgive their sin. The ellipsis which follows, is to be supplied by some such words, as \"well and good\" - \"I am content\" - \"I have no more to say.\" Similar cases of ellipses will be found in Danial 3:5; Luke 13:9; Luke 19:42; John 6:62; Romans 9:22. And if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book. Some interpret this as merely equivalent to, \"Blot me out of the book of the living,\" and explain that phrase as meaning simply - \"Take my life - kill me instead of them\" - but something more seems to be meant. \"The book of the living\" - \"the book of life\" - the book of God's writing - is not merely a register of those who happen to be alive at any given time. It \"contains the list of the righteous, and ensures to those whose names are written therein, life before God, first in the earthly kingdom of God, and then eternal life also\" (Keil). Thus Moses declared his willingness - nay, his wish - that God would visit on him the guilt of his people, both in this world and the next, so that he would thereupon forgive them. St. Paul has a similar burst of feeling (Romans 9:1-3); but it does not involve a formal offer - it is simply the expression of a willingness. Ordinary men are scarcely competent to judge these sayings of great saints. As Bengel says - \"It is not easy to estimate the measure of love in a Moses and a Paul; for the narrow boundary of our reasoning powers does not comprehend it, as the little child is unable to comprehend the courage of heroes.\" Both were willing - felt willing, at any rate - to sacrifice their own future for their countrymen - and Moses made the offer. Of all the noble acts in Moses' life it is perhaps the noblest; and no correct estimate of his character can be formed which does not base itself to a large extent on his conduct at this crisis.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. Beyond a doubt, it is the general teaching of Scripture that vicarious punishment will not be accepted. \"The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son - the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him\" (Ezekiel 18:20). Man \"cannot deliver his brother, or make agreement with God for him; for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever \"(Psalm 49:7, 8). One only atonement is accepted - that of him who is at once man and God - who has, himself, no sin - and can therefore lake the punishment of others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Lead the people unto the place, etc. This was a revocation of the sentence of death passed in verse 10. The people was to be spared, and Moses was to conduct them to Palestine. Mine Angel shall go before thee. Mine Angel - not I myself (compare Exodus 33:2, 3). Another threatened punishment, which was revoked upon the repentance of the people (ib, 4, 6), and the earnest prayer of Moses (ib, 14-16). I will visit their sin upon them. Kalisch thinks that a plague was at once sent, and so understands verse 35. But most commentators regard the day of visitation as that on which it was declared that none of those who had quitted Egypt should enter Canaan (Numbers 14:35), and regard that sentence as, in fact, provoked by the golden calf idolatry (ib, 22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus32:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - The Lord plagued, or \"struck\" - i.e., \"punished\" the people.

The intercession of Moses, and his offer to sacrifice himself for his people had obtained from God some great concessions, viz. -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That the people's lives should be spared (Exodus 32:14);NEWLINENEWLINE2. And that they should be led into Palestine (ibid. ver. 34) But a change had been introduced into the conditions under which the future journeys were to be made, somewhat obscurely indicated in the words - \"Behold, mine angel shall go before thee\" (ibid.) - which was now to be more distinctly set forth. \"God's angel\" may mean his Presence in the Person of his Son - as it appears to mean in Exodus 23:20-23 - or it may mean simply one of the created angelic host, which seems to be its sense in Exodus 32:34, and in ver. 2 of this chapter. By vers. 2 and 3 taken in combination it was rendered manifest, both to Moses and to the people (ver. 4), that they were threatened with the loss of God's actual presence and personal protection during the remainder of their wanderings, and would have, instead of it, the mere guidance and help of an angel in the inferior sense of the word. This was felt to be \"evil tidings\" and the people consequently \"mourned\" and \"stripped themselves of their ornaments\" (ver. 6). Real penitence at last entered their hearts, and led to self-abasement. Verse 1. The Lord said unto Moses. In continuation of what he had said in Exodus 32:33, 34, but possibly at another time; and with the object of fully explaining what had been meant in ver. 34. The land which I sware unto Abraham. See Genesis 12:7; Genesis 13:15; Genesis 15:18, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will send an angel before thee. Note the change from \"my angel\" (Exodus 32:34) to \"an angel;\" which, however, would still have been ambiguous, but for what follows in ver. 3. The angel of God's presence is \"an angel\" in Exodus 23:20. I will drive out. The whole covenant had fallen with Israel's infraction of it, and it was for God to retract or renew his part of it as it pleased him. He here of his free grace renews the promise to drive out the Canaanitish nations. Compare Exodus 23:23-31.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Unto a land. Ver. 2 is parenthetic, and ver. 3 coheres with ver. 1 - \"Go up hence, thou and the people, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham - unto a land flowing,\" etc. On the milk and honey of Canaan, see the comment upon Exodus 3:8. For I will not go up in the midst of thee. At length there was an end of ambiguity - God's purpose was made plain - the people had shown themselves unfit for his near presence, and he would withdraw himself. So it would be best even for them; since, if they were about to show- themselves as perverse in the future as they had in the past, his near presence could only lead to their entire destruction. Some day they would so provoke him, that he would consume them in the way.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - When the people heard. Moses had communicated to the people what God had said to him. They felt it to be evil tidings - they woke up at last to a feeling of the ineffable value of the privileges which they bad hitherto enjoyed - his guidance by the pillar of the cloud (Exodus 13:21) - his counsel, if there were need to ask anything (Exodus 15:25) - his aid in the day of battle (Exodus 17:8-13) - his near presence, by day and by night, constantly (Exodus 13:22) - and they dreaded a change, which they felt must involve a loss, and one the extent of which they could not measure. \"An angel\" is a poor consolation when we are craving for Jehovah! So the people mourned - felt true sorrow - were really troubled in their hearts - and, to show their penitence, ceased to wear their customary ornaments. These may have consisted of armlets, bracelets, and even, perhaps, anklets, all of which were worn by men in Egypt at this period.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. ? For the Lord had said unto Moses, etc. Rather, \"And the Lord said unto M.\" (so most recent commentators, as Keil, Kalisch, etc.) The message was sent to the people after their repentance, and in reply to it. It was not, however, as our version makes it, a threat of destruction, but only a repetition of the statement made in ver. 2, that, if God went up with them, the probable result would be their destruction. Translate - \"Ye are a stiff-necked people; were I for one moment to go up in the midst of thee, I should destroy thee,\" Put off thy ornaments. The command seems strange, when we had just been told that \"no man did put on him his ornaments\" (ver 4) but the word translated put off probably means \"lay aside altogether.\" The intention was to make their continued disuse of the ornaments a test of their penitence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The people accepted the test and stripped themselves of their ornaments - i.e., ceased to wear them henceforward. By the Mount Horeb. Rather, \"from Mount Horeb.\" From and after this occurrence at Horeb ( = Sinai), the Israelites wore no ornaments, in token of their continued contrition for their apostasyNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 33:7-11NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-11. - THE FIRST ERECTION OF A TABERNACLE. The decision of the matter still hung in suspense. God had not revoked his threat to withdraw himself and leave the host to the conduct of an angel. He had merely reserved his final decision (ver. 5). Moses was anxious to wrestle with him in prayer until he obtained the reversal of this sentence; but he could not be always ascending Sinai, when the camp needed his superintending care, and the camp as yet contained no place of worship, where a man could pray and be secure against disturbance. Moses, under these circumstances, with the tabernacle in his mind, but without leisure to construct it, contrived \"for the present distress\" a temporary tabernacle or tent. He took, apparently, the tent that had hitherto been his own, and removed it to a position outside the camp, erecting it there, and at the same time giving it the name of \"the tent of meeting\" (ver. 7). Hither he decreed that all persons should come who desired communion with God (ver. 7), and hither he resorted himself for the same purpose (ver. 8). It pleased God to approve these arrangements; and to show his approval by a visible token. Whenever Moses entered the \"tent of meeting,\" the pillar of the cloud descended from the top of Sinai, and took up its station at the door of the tent (ver. 9), thus securing Moses from interruption. At the sight the people \"worshipped,\" each at his tent's door, while Moses was privileged to speak with God \"face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend\" (ver. 11). Joshua accompanied him on the first occasion, and remained behind, to guard the tent, when Moses left it (ibid.). Verse 7 - Moses took the tabernacle. The \"tabernacle\" proper was not yet constructed. (See chs. 35-40.) And the word used is not that properly rendered \"tabernacle\" - viz., mishkan (Exodus 26:1); but the far more common word ohel, which means \"tent.\" The proper translation would be, \"Moses took the tent.\" But the question at once arises - What tent? It is suggested that the article may have the force of the possessive pronoun, and indicate that he took \"his tent.\" (Compare Matthew 9:10, where \"the house\" undoubtedly means \"his house.\") Moses took his own tent, probably as the best in the encampment, and converted it to a sacred use, transferring his own abode to another. Afar off from the camp. The sacred and the profane must not approach each other too closely - an interval must be set between them. But the distance, evidently, was not great (ver. 10). The tabernacle of the congregation. Rather, \"the tent of meeting\" or \"of conference\" - i.e., the tent in which he expected to meet and converse with God. See the comment on Exodus 27:21. Every one which sought the Lord went out. Moses must have commanded this. The \"tent\" was not to be a mere oratory for himself, but open to all Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - When Moses went out .... all the people rose up. Probably Moses \"went out\" at a set time, or at set times, each day; and the people watched for his going, and \"rose up,\" as a mark of respect and reverence. They felt that he went to the tent mainly to pray for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - As Moses entered into the tabernacle. Rather, \"When Moses was gone into the tent.\" The cloudy pillar descended. It is not quite clear whether this was done once only, or whether the pillar, during the continuance of this \"tent of meeting,\" alternated between the top of Sinai and the door of the tent, descending when Moses entered the tent and reascending when he quitted it. The latter supposition is most consonant with the previous statement (ver. 7) that \"every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle\" (tent), for the people were at no time allowed to approach the cloud. And the Lord talked with Moses. Literally, \"And talked with Moses.\" The cloudy pillar, in and through which God made his presence felt, is here identified with God, and said to have conversed with Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And all the people saw... and all the people rose up. This is a literal translation; but it would make the sense clearer to the ordinary reader if the passage were rendered - \"And when all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the door of the tent, then all the people rose up,\" etc. Worshipped. Literally, \"bowed themselves down\" - \"made an obeisance,\" in token that they recognised the presence of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord spake unto Moses face to face. As one present - not as one at a distance - \"month to mouth,\" as we read in Numbers 12:8 - but not under any visible form (see vers. 20, 23, and compare Deuteronomy 4:12, 15). He turned again. After each conference, Moses returned to the camp, where, no doubt, he had put up for himself another tent, and where his presence was needed He left, however, his personal attendant (\"minister\"), Joshua, to watch and guard the sacred structure during his absence. It is remarkable that the trust was committed to Joshua, rather than to Aaron, or any of the Levites. Probably the reason of this was, that Joshua alone had had no paw in the idolatry of the calf. (See Exodus 32:17.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 33:12-17NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - THE REVOCATION OF THE THREAT OF WITHDRAWAL. After some days' \"wrestling with God\" in the \"tent of meeting,\" Moses prayed to know definitely what God had determined on. \"Show me thy way,\" he said (ver. 13) - \"Whom wilt thou send with me?\" To this demand, God made the gracious reply - \"My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest\" (ver. 14). This was satisfactory, except that it did not distinctly include the conduct of the people - it might be merely a promise to himself. So Moses (vers. 15, 16) requires a more explicit assurance, and, closely associating the people with himself, declares that he will not move a step further, unless God allows the people to find grace in his sight, and consents to \"distinguish\" them by \"going up\" with them. Then at length God yields and gives the assurance\" I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken\" (ver. 17) - i.e. \"I will go up visibly with the people and distinguish them.\" (See the comment on ver. 16.) Verses 12, 13. - See, thou sayest. Moses takes advantage of his privilege of speaking as friend with friend, and uses familiar terms - \"See,\" he says, \"thou hast told me to conduct the people to Canaan, yet thou hast not made it clear whom thou wilt send with me. If it is to be an angel, what angel? Why not the angel of the original promise (Exodus 23:20-23)? Thou hast distinguished me with thy favour - Consider that this nation is thy people, and extend thy favour to them. At any rate shew me thy way - tell me plainly what thou wilt do.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - My presence shall go with thee. Literally,\" My presence shall go up\" - my own presence, not that of an angel. That for which Moses had been so earnestly pleading is, seemingly, granted. God will go up. I will give thee rest. - i.e. \"bring thee to Canaan.\" (Compare Deuteronomy 3:20; Hebrews 4:8.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - And he said. Still Moses is not quite satisfied. God had said - \"I will give thee rest\" - not \"I will give you rest.\" Moses must see distinctly that the people are associated with him before he desists. So he replies - \"If thy presence go not up, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us?\" The reply in ver. 17 sets his doubt finally at rest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - So shall we be separated. Rather, \"So shall we be distinguished.\" God's presence with them would distinguish them from all the other nations of the earth - place them in a category alone and apart from all others. Angelic guidance would not have done this; for even heathen nations had their protecting angels (Daniel 10:13, 20; Daniel 11:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will do this thing also. \"I will extend my favour to thy people also, and distinguish them, as well as thee, by going up with them. I will do this for thy sake, because thou hast found grace in my sight.\" Moses' petition is at last fully granted - the threat of withdrawal cancelled - the promise of Divine guidance and protection renewed I know thee by name. It is a supreme favour for God to know us by name. It marks \"a specifically personal relation to God\" (Keil). The expression is perhaps taken from the phraseology of Oriental Courts, where not one in a hundred of the courtiers is known to the monarch by name.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 33:18-23NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-23. - THE REQUEST TO SEE GOD'S GLORY, AND THE REPLY TO IT. Having obtained the full restoration of the people to God's favour, Moses felt emboldened to ask a boon for himself. He had already been admitted to closer communion with God than any one of the race of man since Adam in Paradise. But what had been granted him, instead of satisfying, only made him desirous of something further, something closer, something than which nothing more close could be imagined. So he asks to see the unveiled glory of God (ver. 18). He asks, that is, to see exactly that which man in the flesh cannot see, or at any rate cannot see and live. But, of course, he does not know this. God, in reply, tells him he shall see all that can be seen of him - more than anything which he has seen before. He shall see \"all his goodness\" - he shall have another revelation of the name of God (ver. 18); and, further, he shall be so placed as to see as much as mortal man can behold of \"his glory\" - God will pass by him, and when he has passed, Moses shall be allowed to look after him, and see what is here called \"his back.\" This was probably some afterglow or reflection from the Divine glory, which language must have been as inadequate to describe as it was to embody the \"unspeakable words\" heard by St. Paul in the \"third heaven,\" and declared by him \"impossible for a man to utter\" (2 Corinthians 12:4). Verse 18. - Show me thy glory. The glory of God had been seen by Moses to a certain extent, when God \"descended in fire\" upon Mount Sinai (Exodus 19:18). It had been seen with more distinctness when he was called up and \"went into the midst of the cloud\" (Exodus 24:18). But he felt, nevertheless, that he had not as vet really beheld it. He longed for that ineffable blessing of the full \"beatific vision,\" which is promised to us after death, if we die in the faith and fear of Christ (1 Corinthians 13:12). \"Increase of appetite doth grow by what it feeds on\" - and the veiled splendours that he had been allowed to see only made him hunger the more for the unveiled radiance that he had not seen as vet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I will make all my goodness pass before thee. It is not quite clear what this means, or how it was fulfilled - whether the reference is to the revelation of God's goodness in Exodus 34:7, or to the entire experience that Moses would have of God in his later life. It is against the former view, that, if we take it, we can assign to the ensuing clause no distinct and separate sense. I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee. See Exodus 34:5, 6. And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious - i.e., I am not bound to do all this for thee. It is of my free grace that I do it. I intend, however, to be gracious, and show mercy to thee, because thou hast found favour in my eyes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - No man can see me and live. The inability proclaimed in these words is not an absolute inability to see God, but an inability to see and survive the sight. Jacob, when he wrestled with the angel, marvelled that he could see God, even in that intermediate way, and live (Genesis 32:30). It may well be that actually to see God, while we are in the flesh, would kill us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Behold, there is a place by me. No sufficient indication is given by these words, or by any other words in Scripture, of the exact locality of the manifestation to Moses. The so-called\" traditions \"are worthless; and we can only say that the scene was probably some portion of the upper part of the Ras Sufsafeh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I will put thee in a clift of the rock, The \"clift\" has been identified with the \"cave of Elijah\" (1 Kings 19:9); but the words used are different; and even were they the same, no identity could be established. It is rather in the broader lines of their missions and characters that resemblance is to be sought between Moses and Elijah than in the minuter details of their careers. Cover thee with my hand - i.e., \"at once conceal thee and protect thee.\" Without these precautions, it is implied, the nearness of the Divine Presence might have had injurious effects.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Thou shalt see my back parts. Literally, \"my back.\" The anthropomorphisms of the passage are numerous and strong - they must, of course, be regarded as accommodations to human ideas. After the Divine Presence had passed by, Moses was to be permitted to look out, and would see so much of the Divine glory as he would be able to bear; but still something far short of that which he had desired to see. The explanation that \"the back of God\" means \"his works - the consequences of his activity\" (Kalisch) is fanciful, and not borne out by the context. My face cannot be seen. See above, ver. 20; and. compare John 1:18; John 6:46; 1 Timothy 1:17; 1 John 4:12.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Hew thee two tables of stone. Literally, \"of stones\" - two separate tables, i.e., made of two separate stones. Moses is required to do this with strict justice, since it was by his act that the former tables were broken (Exodus 32:19). Upon these tables. Literally,\" upon the tables,\" which has exactly the same force. The words that were in the first tables. It is quite true that we have not yet been explicitly told what these words were. (See Exodus 31:18; Exodus 32:15, 16, 19.) It has been left to our natural intelligence to understand that they must have been the \"ten words\" uttered in the ears of all the people amid the thunders of Sinai, as recorded in Exodus 20:1-19, which are the evident basis of all the later legislation. We have, however, in ver. 28, and still more plainly in Deuteronomy 10:4, and Deuteronomy 5:22, the desired statement. The fiction of a double decalogue, invented by Goethe and supported by Hitzig, and even Ewald, is absolutely without foundation in fact.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Be ready in the morning.

The present orders are even more stringent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Moses obeys all the directions given him to the letter - hews, or causes to be hewn, the two tables, making them as like as he can to the former ones - rises early, and ascends the mountain to the appointed spot - and takes with him the tables, for God to perform his promise (ver. 1)of writing the commandments upon them. It has been questioned whether God did actually write the words upon the second tables; but Kurtz's arguments upon the point are unanswerable. (History of the Old Covenant, vol. 3. p. 186, E. T.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 34:5-8NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-8. - THE FULFILMENT BY GOD OF HIS PROMISE TO MOSES. This section coheres closely with the last section of the preceding chapter, and must be regarded, as the historical account of how God fulfilled the promises there made by him to Moses (Exodus 33:19-23). The promises were mainly two -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That he would proclaim his name to him afresh; andNEWLINENEWLINE2. That he would pass by him, and let him see, after he had passed, what man might see of his glory. The fulfilment of the first promise appears in the long enumeration of attributes contained in vers. 6, 7; the fulfilment of the second is expressed with extreme brevity in the words - ,' And the Lord passed by before him\" (ver. 6). Probably no further description could be given of that marvellous manifestation beyond those words in which it was promised (Exodus 33:21-23). Its effects were seen in that permanent reflection of God's glory on the face of Moses, which thenceforth compelled him to wear a veil mostly when he showed himself to the people (vers. 33-35). Verse 5. - The Lord descended in the cloud. The cloudy pillar, which had stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:10), was withdrawn while Moses ascended Sinai, and probably disappeared from men's sight. When Moses reached the top, it descended once more from the sky, and stood with him there. Then a voice from the cloud proclaimed the name of the Lord in the manner more fully stated in the ensuing verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - The Lord passed by before him. God did as he had promised in Exodus 33:22, 23. He made his glory pass by, Moses, as he stood in a \"clift of the rock,\" and \"covered him with his hand as he passed by,\" and, when he had passed, \"took away his hand,\" and allowed Moses to look after him, and see a glorious and transcendent vision - a vision so bright and radiant, and so real, that the light which streamed from it settled on Moses face, and remained there (ver. 20). And proclaimed. In his passage God proclaimed his name; not however, as in the burning bush, an actual name contained in a single word - but a description in many words of his essential nature - a description setting forth especially his three qualities of mercy, truth, and justice, but dwelling most upon the first of the three - perhaps, as most essential, for\" God is love\" (1 John 4:8) - certainly, as moot needing to be prominently set forth at the time, when his favour had been justly forfeited, and but for ]]is mercy could not have been restored. Note the accumulation of terms that are nearly synonymous -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Merciful (or pitiful);NEWLINENEWLINE2. Gracious;NEWLINENEWLINE3. Long-suffering;NEWLINENEWLINE4. Abundant in goodness;NEWLINENEWLINE5. Keeping mercy for thousands: andNEWLINENEWLINE6. Forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin = - An accumulation for the purpose of emphasis - to assure Moses, and through him mankind at large, of the reality of this attribute, On which the possibility of our Salvation depends, and which had Never hitherto been Set forth with anything like such ful. Some critics take this clause in an entirely different sense, translating \"who in destroying will not wholly destroy\" (Maimonides, Pool, De Dieu, Patrick), or, \"who acquits even him who is not innocent\" (Geddes); but the rendering of our translators (which agrees with the LXX.], is approved by Rosenmuller, Gesenius, Kalisch, Keil, and others. It seems to have been also the meaning assigned to the passage by the prophet Nahum, who quotes it (Nahum 1:3) when he is threatening Nineveh. Visiting the iniquity. See above, Exodus 20:5. While setting forth his attribute of mercy in all its fulness, God will not have his attribute of justice forgotten (ver, 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Moses made haste and bowed his head.

Dazed, as it would seem, by the splendour of the vision which he had beheld, Moses forgot that God had already pledged himself to renew the covenant, and lead the people in person to Canaan. In his forgetfulness, he once more set himself to intercede with God on their behalf, and besought him -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That he would go up with them;NEWLINENEWLINE2. That he would pardon them; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. That he would once more take them as his inheritance (ver. 9). Without replying separately to these requests, God formally renews the covenant; promises not only to go up with the people, but to work miracles for them (ver. 10), and to drive out the nations before them when they have arrived (ver. 11); and makes a brief summary of the chief points of positive observance, which he requires of them in addition to the moral law. These points may be reduced to twelve: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That no treaty of peace should be made with the Canaanite nations (ver. 12).NEWLINENEWLINE2. That all their images, altars, and groves should be destroyed (ver. 13).NEWLINENEWLINE3. That no molten image should be made to represent God (ver. 17).NEWLINENEWLINE4. That the Passover festival should be observed as previously commanded (ver. 18).NEWLINENEWLINE5. That the first-born should be dedicated, or redeemed (vers. 19, 20).NEWLINENEWLINE6. That the Sabbath rest should be observed at all times of the year (ver. 21).NEWLINENEWLINE7. That the feast of Pentecost (weeks) should be observed regularly (ver. 22).NEWLINENEWLINE8. That the feast of tabernacles should also be observed (ib,).NEWLINENEWLINE9. That at all the three great festivals all the males should appear before God (ver. 23).NEWLINENEWLINE10. That no leaven should be used with any sacrifice (ver. 25).NEWLINENEWLINE11. That first-fruits of all things should be offered to God (ver. 26).NEWLINENEWLINE12. That no kid should be seethed in her mother's milk (ver. 26). Verse 9. - If now I have found grace in thy sight. The vision vouchsafed him makes Moses feel that he has indeed been received into favour with God. The first use which it occurs to him to make of his position is to intercede anew for his people, he, apparently, forgets that God has already promised to go with them (Exodus 33:17), and prefers exactly the same request which he had made on the preceding day, and which had been granted. To this he adds a prayer for pardon, and a request that God would take Israel for his inheritance. The last phrase is a new one, but expresses perhaps no more than has been implied in such phrases as \"thy people, which thou hast purchased\" (Exodus 15:16) - \"ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me\" (Exodus 19:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I make a covenant - i.e., \"I lay down afresh the terms of the covenant between me and Israel.\" On my part, I will go with them (implied, not expressed), and do miracles for them, and drive out the nations before them (vers. 10, 11), and enlarge their borders, and not allow their land to be invaded at the festival seasons (ver. 24): on their part, they must \"observe that which I command them\" (ver. 11). Marvels such as have not been done in all the earth. As the drying up of the Jordan (Joshua 3:16, 17); the falling down of the walls of Jericho (Joshua 6:20), the slaughter of the army of the five kings by hailstones (Joshua 10:11), and the like. It is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. Terrible, not to Israel, but to Israel's enemies.

The precepts expressly given (vers. 12-26) are, as observed above, almost wholly positive. The moral law did not require recapitulation, because it was enjoined on the people afresh by the writing on the two tables (ver. 28). I drive out before thee.

On idol-altars, see Numbers 23:1, 29; Judges 2:2; 1 Kings 16:32; 1 Kings 18:26, etc. Groves are here for the first time mentioned. They appear to have been artificial constructions, either of wood or metal, or both, more or less imitative of trees, and regarded as emblems of the Oriental nature-deities, especially Baal and Astarte or Ashtoreth. The word translated \"grove\" (asherah) is a modification of the name Ashtoreth. The well-known \"sacred tree\" of the Assyrians is probably an asherah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For thou shalt worship no other God. This is a reference to the Second Commandment (Exodus 20:5). The meaning is - \"Thou shalt not spare the idolatrous emblems of the Canaanite nations, for thou couldst only do so to worship them, and thou art already forbidden to worship any other god beside me.\" The existence of the Decalogue and its binding nature, is assumed throughout this chapterNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15, 16. - The probable consequences of making treaties with the Canaanite nations, alluded to in ver. 12, and in Exodus 23:33, are here fully set forth. They include -NEWLINENEWLINE1. Joining in their idol-feasts;NEWLINENEWLINE2. Intermarriages;NEWLINENEWLINE3. The actual apostasy cf. those who married idolatrous wives.NEWLINENEWLINEThe event fully justified the warning here given. See Judges 2:2, 11-13, 17; Judges 6:25; Judges 10:6, etc. They go a whoring. This expression, so common in the later books, is here used for the first time It implies that the relation between man and God is analogous to that of the marriage-bond, so that deserting him for other gods is a species of adultery. Compare the frequent representations in the New Testament of Christ as the \"Bridegroom\" and the Church as his \"Bride.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt make thee no molten gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

See ch. 23. 15, and compare Exodus 12:14-20, and Exodus 13:3-10. The month Abib.

None shall appear before me empty. Repeated from Exodus 23:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck.

To appreciate the other temptation, we require to know the peculiar circumstances of the East. It is necessary there to complete the ploughing before the spring rains are over. These last but a short time; and when they are once past no rain can be looked for till the autumn.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Of the first-fruits. There is here an unfortunate ambiguity. The English reader naturally supposes that three festivals are mentioned -NEWLINENEWLINE1. That of weeks;NEWLINENEWLINE2. That of the first-fruits of wheat harvest; andNEWLINENEWLINE3. That of in-gathering.NEWLINENEWLINEBut in reality the feast of weeks is that of the first-fruits of wheat harvest. See Leviticus 23:17; Numbers 28:26. The observance of this feast, as well as that of the feast of in-gathering, was commanded in the \"Book of the Covenant\" (Exodus 23:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Thrice in the year, Repeated from Exodus 23:17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I will... enlarge thy borders. The original promise to Abraham was to give to his seed \"the land of Canaan\" (Genesis 12:5-7). Afterwards this promise was enlarged, and he was told that the land assigned them was the entire tract between the Nile and the Euphrates (Genesis 15:18). And practically, they took possession first of the one, while at a later date their border was enlarged, and they became masters of the other. See 1 Kings 4:21, 24; 2 Chronicles 9:26. Neither shall any man desire thy land, etc. This promise is nowhere else made. It would serve as a great encouragement to the proper observance of the festivals.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Repeated from Exodus 23:18.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Repeated from Exodus 23:19. It is remarkable that both legislations terminate with the same, somewhat strange, proviso. There must have been an intention of impressing strongly upon the people the principle of tenderness involved in it. (See the comment on Exodus 23:19.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 34:27-35NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-35. - FINAL DESCENT OF MOSES FROM SINAI. The covenant having been renewed, Moses prepared to descend, having first however received a command to commit to writing the words of this second covenant (ver. 27). He received back the tables from God, inscribed with the Ten Commandments, and after a stay in Sinai of equal duration with the former one (ver. 28), descended, having the tables in his hands. He was not aware that the skin of his face had become radiant (ver. 29), and first learnt the fact by the rulers being afraid to come near him (ver. 30). After conversing with them and with the people he resolved to \"put a vail on his face\" ordinarily, only taking it of[ when he \"went in before the Lord\" into the ,, tent of meeting,\" and when, having received a message from the Lord to the people, he came out to deliver it. Verse 27. - Write thou these words. Literally, \"write thee these words\" - i.e., \"write them for thyself and for thy people.\" According to the tenor of these words have I made a covenant. That is, \"the covenant on my part is conditional on the observance of these words on the part of Israel.\" The \"words\" intended are those of vers. 10-26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - He was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights. As on the former occasion (Exodus 24:18). The patience and faith of the people was tested by this second long delay. Happily, they stood the test; and on Moses' final descent from Sinai the Israelites were found expectant and obedient (vers. 30-32). He did neither eat bread nor drink water. This was so also on the former occasion (Deuteronomy 9:9), though it is not mentioned in Exodus. The near presence of God sustained the vital powers and made food unnecessary. Moses, Elijah (1 Kings 19:8), and our Lord have alone accomplished a fast of this duration. Modern parodies are not held by scientific men to belong to the category of established facts. He wrote upon the tables. It has been argued from this expression that Moses wrote the words on the second tables; and it would be natural so to understand the passage, had nothing else been said on the subject. But in ver. 1 we are told that \"God said, I will write upon these tables;\" and the same is repeated in Deuteronomy 10:2. Moreover in Deuteronomy 10:4, it is distinctly declared \"He\" (i.e. God) \"wrote on the tables according to the first writing.\" We must therefore regard \"he\" in this passage as meaning \"the Lord,\" which is quite possible according to the Hebrew idiom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - The skin of his face shone while he talked with him. Rather, \"through his talking with him.\" The glory of God, as revealed to Moses on this occasion, caused his face to become henceforth radiant. Compare the effect of the transfiguration (Matthew 17:2). The Vulgate wrongly translates haran, \"to shine,\" as if it were derived from keren, \"a horn\" - whence the painters of mediaeval times commonly represent Moses as horned. St. Paul's words (2 Corinthians 3:7) are conclusive as to the true meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - They were afraid. They shrank from Moses, as if he were more than man. (Compare Ezekiel 1:28; Revelation 1:17.) Perhaps they thought that what they saw was his spirit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Moses called unto them. Moses bade them approach - no doubt assured them that there was no cause for fear (cf. Luke 24:38, 39) - and by his manner and familiar voice dispelled their fears and re-assured them. Aaron and all the rulers... returned unto him. Apparently, in their alarm they had drawn back. Being re-assured, they \"returned.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - All that the Lord had spoken. \"All,\" i.e., \"that the Lord had commanded him to enjoin upon them\" - especially the precepts in vers. 10-26 - not all that he had heard from God in the space of forty days and forty nights.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 33-35. - Till Moses had done speaking with them. The Hebrew text will not bear this rendering. All the ancient versions (LXX. Vulg. Syr. etc.) and the Targums agree that the meaning is - \"when Moses had done speaking, he put a veil on his face.\" And this agrees with the plain meaning of vers. 34 and 35, which are to be taken connectedly. Moses first delivered his message with face unveiled, then he veiled himself, and thenceforth he wore a veil at all times except when he sought the Divine presence in the \"tent of meeting\" or the tabernacle, and when he delivered to the people any message sent them from God by him. He wore the veil ordinarily to prevent them from being dazzled. He took it off when he entered the tabernacle, that the Divine presence might shine fully on him and renew his strength. He kept it off when he returned, if he had any message to the people, until he had delivered it, in order the more fully to authenticate the message and shew to the people that it was from God. Then the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone (ver. 35). Having discharged himself of the message intrusted to him, he once more covered himself, and continued veiled until he again entered the tabernacle. The only objection that can be taken to this exegesis is derived from 2 Corinthians 3:7-16, which has been thought to imply that Moses wore the veil whenever he was in the sight of the people. But the passage does not really assert any such thing. It is quite enough for the argument, that under the old covenant a veil had been worn to conceal some of its glory. This concealment St. Paul contrasts with the openness of Christianity (vers. 13, 18); while at the same time he argues that it may be viewed as typical of that blindness and darkness which was characteristic of the Jewish nation of his day.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus34:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out.

All therefore had to be summoned, to learn what was required.

The kindling of fire in early times involved considerable labour. It was ordinarily affected by rubbing two sticks together, or twisting one round rapidly between the two palms in a depression upon a board. Fire only came after a long time. Moreover, as in the warm climate of Arabia and Palestine artificial warmth was not needed, fire could only have been kindled there for cooking purposes, which involved further unnecessary work, and had already been forbidden (Exodus 16:23). The Karaite Jews still maintain the observance of this precept to the letter, even in cold climates, as in that of the Crimea, and allow neither fire nor light in their houses on the sabbath day; but the Jews generally view the precept as having had only a temporary force, and have lights and fires, like other persons, even in Palestine. Strict Jews, however, still cook no food on the sabbath day.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 35:4-20NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-20. - THE PEOPLE INVITED TO BRING GIFTS, AND ASSIST IN THE WORK OF THE TABERNACLE. Having warned the Israelites against breaches of the sabbath, Moses proceeded to enumerate the offerings which God had said that they might bring (vers. 4-9), and the works which he had required to be constructed (vers. 10-19). In the former enumeration, he follows exactly the order and wording of the Divine command to himself, as recorded in Exodus 25:3-7; in the latter, he changes the order, mentioning first the building, with its component parts (ver. 11), then the contents of the building (vers. 12-15), then the court with its contents (vers. 16, 17) together with some details which had been omitted in the former account (ver. 18), and finally the holy garments (ver. 19).

Moses dismissed the people; but they soon began to return, bringing their offerings with them. There was a general, if not a universal, willingness Men and women alike \"brought bracelets (brooches?), and earrings, and rings, and armlets - all articles of gold,\" and offered them to the Lord (ver. 22). Others brought blue and purple and scalier and fine linen, and goats' hair and rams' skins dyed red, and badger (or rather, seal) skins (ver. 23). Silver and bronze and shittimwood were contributed by others (ver. 24). The women, who were the only spinners, brought their spun yarn of blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen, and their yarn of goats' hair (vers. 25, 26); while the richest class of all - \"the rulers\" - gave, as their contribution, the onyx stones for the ephod, the jewels for the high-priest's breastplate, and the oil needed for the light, together with rare spices for the anointing ointment and the incense (vers. 27, 28). Subsequently, we are told that what was contributed was \"much more than enough\" (Exodus 36:5), and that the people had to be \"restrained from bringing\" (ibid. 6). Verse 21. - The Lord's offering - i.e., \"their offering to Jehovah.\" For all his service. The use of \"his\" for \"its\" causes an unfortunate ambiguity here. The antecedent to the pronoun is not the Lord, but the tabernacle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They came, both men and women. That among the Hebrews gold ornaments were worn by men, as well as by women, is indicated by Exodus 3:22, and Exodus 32:2. The Egyptian men at the time of the Exodus wore armlets, bracelets, and sometimes anklets, but not often earrings Earrings, however, had been worn by the household of Jacob (Genesis 35:2). Bracelets. Rather, \"buckles\" or \"brooches.\" Kalisch says, \"nose-rings,\" and so Gesenins and Rosenmuller. Tablets. Rather, \"armlets\" (Furst, Cook), or perhaps \"necklaces \"(Gesenius Kalisch, Knobel). Every man that offered, offered an offering of gold. It is not meant that every man who offered anything gave with it an offering of gold, but simply that, besides those who brought the articles named there were others who brought gold offerings of some different kind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Red skins of rams.

Curiously, however, the amount obtained in this way is not given in Exodus 38:24-29.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - All the women that were wise-hearted - i.e., \"skilful.\" See the comment on Exodus 28:3.

They brought onyx stones for the ephod (Exodus 28:9-12) and stones to be set, - i.e., gems for the breastplate (ibid. 17-20); oil of olive for the lamp (Exodus 27:20) and the holy ointment (Exodus 29:24), and spice for the same (ibid. 23, 24) and for the incense (ibid. 34).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 35:30-35NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-35. - THE APPOINTMENT OF BEZALEEL AND AHOLIAB TO SUPERINTEND THE WORK. Though, in some real sense, \"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,\" still Moses was probably devoid of the technical knowledge requisite for a \"superintendent of the works\" on the present occasion. At any rate, his other duties imperatively required that he should decline to undertake, in addition to them, so onerous an office. And God had told him whom it would be best for him to set over the work (Exodus 31:1-6). Accordingly, he now made known to the people that the construction of the tabernacle and its appurtenances would be committed to two men - Bezaleel, the son of Uri, as principal, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, as his assist-ant - who would \"teach\" those under them what they were to do (ver. 34). Verse 30. - The Lord hath called, etc See Exodus 31:2: - \"I have called by name Bezaleel,\" etc. Of the tribe of Judah. The descent of Bezaleel from Judah has been already traced.

Rather, \"And he hath put it into his heart to teach.\" He (God) has given him the gift of being able to teach others, and so has enabled him to form a body of workmen competent to carry out his conceptions. Both he and Aholiab. God has given the same gift to Aholiab. On the special talent of Aholiab, see the comment upon Exodus 31:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus35:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThem hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart - i.e., \"with talent or genius.\" Of the engraver. Rather, \"of the artificer,\" a general term, under which working in metal, Gem-engraving, and wood-carving are included. And of the cunning workman. Rather, \"and of the skilful weaver.\" This clause seems to apply to Aholiab (Exodus 38:23), the preceding one to Bezaleel. And of the embroiderer. This also applies to Aholiab (1.s.c.). And of the weaver - i.e., \"the ordinary, weaver,\" who wove a cloth all of one colour. The \"skilful weaver\" produced a patterned fabric. (See Exodus 26:1.) The methods of working here spoken of are, all of them, such as were well known in Egypt at the time, and which, consequently, it would have been quite natural for some of the Israelites to have learnt. We are not to suppose that God supernaturally communicated to Bezaleel and Aholiab the technical knowledge required in their occupations, but only that he gave them genius and artistic skill, so that both their designs, and their execution of them, were of unusual excellence.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.36":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus36:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3 and 8-38. - THE PROGRESS OF THE WORK, AND THE SUPERFLUOUS LIBERALITY OF THE PEOPLE - THE LATTER HAS TO BE RESTRAINED (vers. 3-7). Bezaleel and Aholiab felt that the time for action was now come. They at once addressed themselves to their task. Moses delivered into their hands all the various offerings which the people, rich and poor, had brought in (Exodus 35:21-29); and skilled workmen were immediately called upon to shape it for the designed uses. The fact of the work being commenced did not stop the inflow of gifts. More and yet more continued to be brought \"every morning\" (ver. 3). At last it became clear that the supply had exceeded the demand; and the workmen reported so to Moses (vers. 4, 5), who thereupon commanded that the offerings should cease (ver. 6). The progress of the work is then reported in detail, and in the following order: -NEWLINENEWLINE1. The covering for the tabernacle (vers. 8-13);NEWLINENEWLINE2. The goats' hair covering for the tent above the tabernacle (vers. 14-18);NEWLINENEWLINE3. The outer coverings of rams' skins and seals' skins (ver. 19);NEWLINENEWLINE4. The boards for the walls of the tabernacle (vers. 20-30);NEWLINENEWLINE5. The bars for the boards (vers. 31-34);NEWLINENEWLINE6. The veil of the most holy place (vers. 35, 30);NEWLINENEWLINE7. The hanging for the entrance to the tabernacle (vers. 37, 38).NEWLINENEWLINEThe chapter, from ver. 8, runs parallel with ch. 26, differing from it mainly in describing as made that which in ch. 26. is ordered to be made. Verse 1. - Then wrought Bezaleel, etc. This is introductory to the entire sub-section, which extends to the end of ch. 39. It means - \"Then, under the direction of Bezaleel and Aholiab, began the work of constructing that place of meeting for which commandment had been given to Moses in the mount.\" The master-craftsmen, and those under them, \"wrought,\" and took care that all was done according to all that the Lord had commanded. It is to mark the exactitude of the obedience that chs. 36. - 39, follow so closely, and with such minuteness, the wording of chs. 26. - 28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus36:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - Moses called Bezaleel, etc. Having received sufficient materials for a beginning, Moses summoned Bezaleel, Aholiab, and their chief assistants, to his presence, and delivered into their hands the various offerings - the wood, the metal, the precious stones, the thread, the goats' hair, the rams' skins, the seals' skins, etc. Upon these materials they proceeded at once to work. They brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. The people still continued to give. Freewill offerings kept continually flowing in. Morning after morning a fresh supply was brought to Moses, who passed it on to those engaged in the work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus36:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal.

The workmen were cumbered with an overplus of material - an embarras de richesses - and came in a body to Moses, to make complaint.

The passage from ver. 8 to ver. 18 corresponds exactly with Exodus 26:1-11; that from ver. 19-34 with Exodus 26:14-29; that consisting of vers. 35, 36, with Exodus 26:33, 34; and the two concluding vers. with Exodus 26:36, 37.

Ver. 29 is an abbreviation of Exodus 30:23-25, and 34, 35. Verse 1. - Bezaleel made the ark. The particular maker of the various parts and contents of the tabernacle is not elsewhere pointed out.

It was natural that the Hebrew women should possess similar articles, and should have taken care to bring them with them out of Egypt. The sacrifice of them for a sacred purpose is rather to be ascribed to their own serf-denying piety than to any command issued by Moses (Spencer). Which assembled.

Before dismissing the subject of the construction of the tabernacle, Moses places on record the sum of the gold, silver and bronze contributed and consumed in the work. At the same time he informs us who was the accountant by whom the sum was made up (ver. 21), and what were the portions of the work formed of each metal (vers. 24, 27, 28, 30, 31). Incidentally he mentions the number of the congregation at this period (ver. 26), and the weight of the \"sockets\" or \"bases\" (ver. 27). Verse 21. - This is the sum. Or \"numbering\" (as in Numbers 26:63). The tabernacle of testimony. The tabernacle, i.e., of which the great glory was that it contained \"the testimony\" or \"Two Tables.\" Compare Exodus 25:16. For the service of the Levites. Literally \"a service of the Levites by the hand of Ithamar,\" etc. - i.e. \"a service which was performed by the Levites at the command of Ithamar.\" It is somewhat remarkable that the direction of the Levites should be assigned to Ithamar, rather than to Nadab or Abihu.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus38:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Bezaleel made all.

The value of the gold has been estimated by Canon Cook at £175,075 13s. 0d. of our money; by Thenius at 877,300 Prussian thalers, or about £131,595. It was certainly under £200,000. De Wette and others have argued that the possession of so large a sum in gold at this time by the Hebrew nation is inconceivable. But most critics are of a different opinion. Gold was very abundant in Egypt at the period, being imported from Ethiopia, a rich gold-producing country (Herod. 3:23; Diod. Sic. 3:11), as well as taken in tribute from the nations of Asia. The wealth of Rhampsinitus (Rameses III.), a little later than the exodus, was enormous (Herod. 2:121; Rawlinson, History of Egypt, vol. 2. pp. 368, 378). According to the preceding narrative (Exodus 12:35, 36) much of the wealth of Egypt had, at the moment of their quitting the country, passed from the Egyptians to the Hebrews. If they numbered two millions of souls, their gold ornaments are likely to have been worth very much more than £200,000 of our money. On the shekel of the sanctuary, see the comment upon Exodus 30:13.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus38:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The silver. The silver seems to have amounted to about four times the weight of the gold; but the value of it was very much less, not exceeding £40,000 of our money (Cook). It may seem surprising that this should have been so; but there are grounds for believing that both in Africa and in Asia gold was more plentiful than silver in the early ages. And it is certainly much more suitable for ornaments. Of them that were numbered. See above, Exodus 30:12-16. The silver for the sanctuary was collected by a compulsory tax, of the nature of a church-rate. This produced the amount here given, No estimate is made of the weight of the silver freewill offerings (Exodus 35:24), nor is any account given of their application.

Literally, \"for every head.\" From twenty years old and upward. Compare Numbers 1:3, 22, etc. Six hundred thousand, etc. It is remarkable that this number agrees exactly with the sum total of the numbering in Numbers 2:32, which took place about six months later, and was exclusive of 22,000 Levites.

The Hebrew expresses that this was his regular occupation. Understand by \"flock\" either sheep or goats, or the two intermixed. Both anciently and at the present day the Sinaitic pastures support these animals, and not horned cattle. Of Jethro, his father-in-law. The word translated \"father-in-law\" is of much wider application, being used of almost any relation by marriage. Zipporah uses it of Moses in Exodus 4:25, 26; in Genesis 19:12, 14, it is applied to Lot's \"sons-in-law;\" in other places it is used of \"brothers-in-law.\" Its application to Jethro does not prove him to be the same person as Reuel, which the difference of name renders improbable. He was no doubt the head of the tribe at this period, having succeeded to that dignity, and to the priesthood, when Reuel died. He may have been either Reuel's son or his nephew. The backside of the desert, i.e. \"behind\" or \"beyond the desert,\" across the strip of sandy plain which separates the coast of the Elanitic Gulf from the mountains, to the grassy regions beyond. He came to the mountain of God, even Horeb. Rather, \"the mountain of God, Horeb-way,\" or \"towards Horeb.\" By \"the mountain of God\" Sinai seems to be meant. It may be so named either by anticipation (as \"the land of Rameses\" in Genesis 47:11), or because there was already a sanctuary there to the true God, whom Reuel and Jethro worshipped (Exodus 18:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The angel of the Lord. Literally, \"an angel of Jehovah.\" Taking the whole narrative altogether, we are justified in concluding that the appearance was that of \"the Angel of the Covenant\" or\" the Second Person of the Trinity himself;\" but this is not stated nor implied in the present verse. We learn it from what follows. The angel \"appeared in a flame of fire out of the midst of the thorn-bush\" - not out of \"a thorn-bush - which may be explained by there being only one on the spot, which however seems improbable, as it is a common tree; or by Moses having so often spoken of it, that, when he came to write to his countrymen, he naturally called it \"the bush,\" meaning \"the bush of which you have all heard.\" So St. John says of the Baptist (John 3:24) that \"he was not yet cast into the prison, meaning, prison into which you all know that he was cast. Seneh, the word translated \"bush,\" is still the name of a thorny shrub, a species of acacia, common in the Sinaitic district.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will turn aside.

This collocation of words is fatal in the entire Elohistic and Jehovistic theory, for no one can suppose that two different writers wrote the two clauses of the sentence. Nor, if the same term was originally used in both clauses, would any reviser have altered one without altering both. Out of the midst of the bush. A voice, which was the true voice of God, appeared to Moses to proceed out of the midst of the fire which enveloped the thorn-bush. An objective reality is described, not a vision. Moses, Moses. The double call implies urgency. Compare the call of Samuel (1 Samuel 3:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Draw not nigh. The awful greatness of the Creator is such that his creatures, until invited to draw near, are bound to stand aloof. Moses, not yet aware that God himself spoke to him, was approaching the bush too close, to examine and see what the \"great thing\" was. (See ver. 3.) On the general unfitness of man to approach near to holy things, see the comment on Exodus 19:12. Put off thy shoes. Rather, \"thy sandals.\" Shoes were not worn commonly, even by the Egyptians, until a late period, and would certainly not be known in the land of Midian at this time. The practice of putting them off before entering a temple, a palace, or even the private apartments of a house, was, and is, universal in the East - the rationale of it being that the shoes or sandals have dust or dirt attaching to them. The command given to Moses at this time was repeated to Joshua (Joshua 5:15). Holy ground. Literally, \"ground of holiness \" - ground rendered holy by the presence of God upon it - not \"an old sanctuary,\" as some have thought, for then Moses would not have needed the information. Exodus - The God of thy father. \"Father\" here is used collectively, meaning forefathers generally, a usage well known to Hebraists. (Compare Exodus 15:2, antioch, 18:4.) The God of Abraham, etc., i.e. the God who revealed himself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and entered into covenant with them (Genesis 15:1-21; Genesis 26:2-5; Genesis 35:1-12). The conclusion which our Blessed Lord drew from this verse (Matthew 22:32) is not directly involved in it, but depends on his minor premiss, \"God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.\" Moses hid his face. A natural instinctive action. So Elijah, on the same site (1 Kings 19:13) and the holy angels before God's throne in heaven (Isaiah 6:2). In the religious system of Rome, the augurs when discharging their office, and all persons when offering a sacrifice, veiled their heads. (See Liv. 1:18; Virg.

Literally \"Seeing I have seen\" - an expression implying continuance. On the force of the anthropomorphic terms \"seeing, hearing, knowing,\" as used of God, see the comment on Exodus 2:24-25. Taskmasters. Not the general superintendents of Exodus 1:11, but subordinate officials, who stood over the labourers and applied the rod to their backs. (See above, Exodus 2:11.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - I am come down. Another anthropomorphism, and one very common in Scripture (Genesis 11:5, 7; Genesis 18:21; Psalm 18:9; Psalm 144:5, etc.), connected of course with the idea that God has a special dwellingplace, which is above the earth. To bring them up. Literally correct. Palestine is at a much higher level than Egypt. (Compare Genesis 12:10; Genesis 13:1; Genesis 37:25; Genesis 39:1; Genesis 42:2; Genesis 46:3, 4; Genesis 50:25.) A good land and a large. The fertility of Palestine, though not equal to that of Egypt, was still very great. Eastward of Jordan, the soil is rich and productive, the country in places wooded with fine trees, and the herbage luxuriant. Vast tracts in the spring produce enormous crops of grain, and throughout the year pasturage of every kind is abundant. \"Still the countless flocks and herds may be seen, droves of cattle moving on like troops of soldiers, descending at sunset to drink of the springs-literally, in the language of; the prophet, \"rams, and lambs, and goats, and bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan (Stanley, Jewish Church, pp. 217, 218). The western region is less productive, but by careful cultivation in terraces may be made to bear excellent crops of corn, olives, and figs. Palestine proper to a modern European seems small, being about the size of Belgium, less than Holland or Hanover, and not much larger than Wales. It contains about 11,000 square miles. To an Israelite of the age of Moses such a land would appear sufficiently \"large;\" for it was considerably larger than the entire Delta of Egypt, whereof his nation occupied the smaller half; and it fell but little short of the entire cultivable area of the whole land of Egypt, which was the greatest and most powerful country known to him. It may be added that the land included in the covenant which God made with Abraham (Genesis 15:18-21), and actually possessed by David and Solomon (1 Kings 4:21), was a \"good land and a large,\" according even to modern notions, including (as it did) besides Palestine the whole of Syria, and thus containing an area of from 50,000 to 60,000 square miles. The phrase flowing with milk and honey, first used here, and so common in the later books (Numbers 13:27; Deuteronomy 26:9, 15; Deuteronomy 31:20; Jeremiah 11:5; Jeremiah 32:22; Ezekiel 20:6, etc.) was probably a proverbial expression for \"a land of plenty,\" and not intended literally. See what the spies say, Numbers 13:27 The enumeration of the nations of Palestine here made is incomplete, five only of the ten whose land was promised to Abraham (Genesis 15:19-21) being expressly mentioned. One, however, that of the Hivites, is added. We may suppose that they had succeeded to the Kenizzites or the Kadmonites of Abraham's time. The only important omission is that of the Girgashites, who hold their place in most other enumerations (Genesis 10:16; Genesis 15:21; Deuteronomy 7:1; Joshua 3:10; Joshua 24:11, etc.), but seem to have been the least important of the \"seven nations,\"and are omitted in Judges 3:5. (\"Girgashites\" is introduced in the Samaritan version and the Sept.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - This is a repetition, in substance, of ver. 7, on account of the long parenthesis in ver. 8, and serves to introduce verse 10. The nexus is: \"I have seen the oppression - I am come down to deliver them - come now, therefore, I will send thee\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCome now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And Moses said... Who am I, that I should go, etc. A great change had come over Moses. Forty years earlier he had been forward to offer himself as a \"deliverer.\" He \"went out\" to his brethren and slew one of their oppressors, and \"supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them\" (Acts 7:25). \"But they understood not\" (ibid.) They declined to accept him for leader, they reproached him with setting himself up to be \"a ruler and a judge\" over them. And now, taught by this lesson, and sobered by forty years of inaction, he has become timid and distrustful of himself, and shrinks from putting himself forward. Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh? What weight can I, a foreigner, forty years an exile, with the manners of a rough shepherd, expect to have with the mighty monarch of all Egypt - the son of Rameses the Great, the inheritor of his power and his glories? And again, Who am I, that I should bring forth the children of Israel? What weight can I expect to have with my countrymen, who will have forgotten me - whom, moreover, I could not influence when I was,in my full vigour - who then \"refused\" my guidance and forced me to quit them? True diffidence speaks in the words used - there is no ring of insincerity in them; Moses was now as distrustful of himself as in former days he had been confident, and when he had become fit to be a deliverer, ceased to think himself fit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Certainly I will be with thee. Literally, \"Since I will be with thee.\" Moses had excused himself on the ground of unfitness. God replies - \"Thou wilt not be unfit, since I will be with thee - I will supply thy deficiencies - I will impart all the qualities thou needest - and this shall be a sign unto thee of my power and faithfulness - this shall assure thee that I am not sending thee upon a fruitless errand - it is determined in my counsels that not only shalt thou succeed, and lead the people out, but after that, - when thou hast so done - thou and they together shall serve me on this mountain.\" The \"sign\" was one which appealed to faith only, like that given to Hezekiah by Isaiah (2 Kings 19:29), but, if accepted, it gave a full assurance - the second step involved the first - the end implied the means - if Moses was of a certainty to bring the Israelites to Sinai, he must first lead them out of Egypt - he must in some way or other triumph over all the difficulties which would beset the undertaking.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - What is his name? It is not at all clear why Moses should suppose that the Israelites would ask him this question, nor does it even appear that they did ask it. Perhaps, however, he thought that, as the Egyptians used the word \"god,\" generically, and had a special name for each particular god - as Ammon, Phthah, Ra, Mentu, Her, Osiris, and the like - when he told his people of \"the God of their fathers,\" they would conclude that he, too, had a proper name, and would wish to know it. The Egyptians set much store by the names of their gods, which in every ease had a meaning. Ammen was \"the concealed (god),\" Phthah, \"the revealer,\" Ra,\"the swift,\" etc. Hitherto Israel's God had had no name that could be called a proper name more than any other. He had been known as \"El,\" \"The High;\" \"Shad-dai,\" \"The Strong;\" and \"Jehovah,\" \"The Existent;\" but these terms had all been felt to be descriptive epithets, and none of them had passed as yet into a proper name. What was done at this time, by the authority of God himself, was to select from among the epithets one to be distinctly a proper name, and at the same time to explain its true meaning as something more than \"The Existent\" - as really \"The Alone Existent\" - the source of all existence. Henceforth this name, which had previously been but little used and perhaps less understood, predominated over every other, was cherished by the Jews themselves as a sacred treasure, and recognised by those around them as the proper appellation of the one and only God whom the Israelites worshipped. It is found in this sense on the Moabite stone ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11, p. 166), in the fragments of Philo-Byblius, and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I AM THAT I AM. No better translation can be given of the Hebrew words. \"I will be that I will be (Geddes) is more literal, but less idiomatic, since the Hebrew was the simplest possible form of the verb substantive. \"I am because I am\" (Boothroyd) is wrong, since the word asher is certainly the relative. The Septuagint, Αγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν, explains rather than translates, but is otherwise unobjectionable. The Vulgate, sum qui sum, has absolute exactness. The idea expressed by the name is, as already explained, that of real, perfect, unconditioned, independent existence. I AM hath sent me to you. \"I am\" is an abbreviated form of \"I am that I am,\" and is intended to express the same idea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The Lord God. In the original Jehovah elokey - \"Jehovah, God of your fathers,\" etc. The name is clearly an equivalent of the \"I AM\" in the preceding versa The exact mode of its formation from the old root hava, \"to be,\" is still disputed among the best Hebraists. This is my name for ever. Henceforth there will be no change - this will be my most appropriate name so long as the world endures - \"The Existent\" - \"The Alone Existent\" - \"He that is, and was, and is to come\" (Revelation 1:4, 8; Revelation 4:8; Revelation 11:17; Revelation 16:5). My memorial. The name whereby I am to be spoken of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Gather the elders. It is generally thought that we are to understand by \"the elders\" not so much the more aged men, as these who bore a certain official rank and position among their brethren, the heads of the various houses (Exodus 6:14, 25; 11:21), who exercised a certain authority even during the worst times of the oppression. Moses was first to prevail, on them to acknowledge his mission, and was then to go with them to Pharaoh and make his representation (ver. 18). I have surely visited you. The words are a repetition of those used by Joseph on his deathbed (Genesis 50:24), and may be taken to mean, \"I have done as Joseph prophesied - I have made his words good thus far. Expect, therefore, the completion of what he promised.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - They shall hearken to thy voice. Moses thought they would despise him - turn a deaf ear to his words - look upon him as unworthy of credit. But it was not so. The hearts of men are in God's hands, and he disposed those of the elders to receive the message of his servant, Moses, favourably, and believe in it. (See Exodus 4:29-31.) Thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt. This future is perhaps one of command rather than of prophetic announcement. The elders do not seem to have actually made their appearance before Pharaoh. (See Exodus 5:1-4.) They may, however, have authorised Moses and Aaron to speak in their name. The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Through our representative Moses. \"Met with us\" is undoubtedly the true meaning. That we may sacrifice. There was reticence here, no doubt, but no falseness. It was a part of God's design that sacrifice, interrupted during the sojourn in Egypt for various reasons, should be resumed beyond the bounds of Egypt by His people. So much of his purpose, and no more, he bade Moses lay before Pharaoh on the first occasion. The object of the reticence was not to deceive Pharaoh, but to test him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - I am sure. Literally, \"I know,\" a better rendering, since, \"I am sure\" implies something leas than knowledge. No, not by a mighty hand. Or \"not even by a mighty hand.\" Pharaoh will not be willing to let you go even when my mighty hand is laid upon him. (See Exodus 8:15, 19, 32; Exodus 9:12, 35; Exodus 10:20, 27.) \"But by strong hand\" (marg.) is a rendering which the rules of grammar do not permit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I will stretch out my hand. To encourage Moses and the people, to support them in what was, humanly speaking, a most unequal contest, this important promise is made. It is a confirmation, and to some extent, an explanation of the pledge, already, given, \"Certainly I will be with thee\" (ver. 12). It shows how God would be with him - he would smite Egypt with all his wonders - what those would be was left obscure. He would come to his people's aid, and openly assert himself, and afflict and strike terror into their enemies-until at last even Pharaoh's stubborn spirit would be broken, and he would consent to let them go.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - The \"spoiling of the Egyptians\" has called forth much bitter comment. (See Kalisch, note on Exodus 3:22.) It has been termed a combination of \"fraud, deception and theft\" - \"base deceit and nefarious fraud\" - \"glaring villainy,\" and the like. The unfortunate translation of a verb meaning \"ask\" by \"borrow\" in ver. 22, has greatly helped the objectors. In reality, what God here commanded and declared was this: - The Israelite women were told on the eve of their departure from Egypt to ask presents (bakh-sheesh) from their rich Egyptian neighbours, as a contribution to the necessary expenses of the long journey on which they were entering; and God promised that he would so favourably incline the hearts of these neighbours towards them, that, in reply to their request, articles of silver and of gold, together with raiment, would be freely and bounteously bestowed on them - so freely and so bounteously, that they might clothe and adorn, not only themselves, but their sons and daughters, with the presents; and the entire result would be that, instead of quitting Egypt like a nation of slaves, in rags and penniless, they would go forth in the guise of an army of conquerors, laden with the good things of the country, having (with their own good-will) \"spoiled the Egyptians.\" No fraud, no deceit, was to be practised - the Egyptians perfectly well understood that, if the Israelites once went, they would never voluntarily return - they were asked to give and they gave - with the result that Egypt was \"spoiled.\" Divine justice sees in this a rightful nemesis. Oppressed, wronged, down-trodden, miserably paid for their hard labour during centuries, the Israelites were to obtain at the last something like a compensation for their ill-usage; the riches of Africa were to be showered on them. Egypt, \"glad at their departing,\" was to build them a bridge of gold to expedite their flight, and to despoil herself in order to enrich her quondam slaves, of whom she was, under the circumstances, delighted to be rid.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Borrow. The Hebrew word means simply \"ask\" (αἰτήσει, LXX.; postula-bit, Vulg.). Of her neighbours. The intermixture to some extent of the Egyptians with the Hebrews in Goshen is here again implied, as in chs. 1. and 2. And of her that sojourneth in her house. Some of the Israelites, it would seem, took in Egyptian lodgers superior to them in wealth and rank. This implies more friendly feeling between the two nations than we should have expected; but it is quite natural that, after their long stay in Egypt, the Hebrews should have made a certain number of the Egyptians their friends.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.40":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-33. - THE COMMAND TO SET UP THE TABERNACLE, AND ITS PERFORMANCE. All was now ready. Bezaleel and Aholiab had completed their task. The work for the tabernacle had been given in, and had been approved Moses did not however at once set it up. He waited for a command from God. After a short interval, the command came. He was ordered to select the first day of the ensuing year - the first day of the first year of freedom - for the operation. Directions were given him, which fixed the order in which the various parts were to be set up, and assigned to the various articles of furniture their proper places (vers. 1-8). When he had arranged the whole as directed, he was to anoint the various parts (vers. 9-11). He was then to wash and dress Aaron, and his sons; to invest them with their robes of office (vers. 12-14), and to anoint them to be priests (ver. 15). The orders given were executed, except (as it would seem) those concerning the investiture of the priests and the anointing, which were deferred. (See Leviticus 8:6-30.)

Probably, there would not have been time to go through all the ceremonies enjoined (Exodus 29:1-34) on the same day with the erection of the sanctuary. They were consequently deferred, either till the next day, or possibly to a later date. (See Leviticus 8.) The anointing of the tabernacle is recorded in ver. 10; of the vessels in ver. 11; of the altar and laver in the same. The washing of Aaron and his sons in ver. 6; their investiture in vers. 7-9; the anointing of Aaron in ver. 12; and a further anointing of Aaron together with his sons in ver. 30.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - An altar most holy.

The mode of anointing does not seem to have been identical in the two cases. The oil was first poured upon Aaron's head (Leviticus 8:12; Psalm 133:2), and afterwards sprinkled upon him (Leviticus 8:30). It was, apparently, only sprinkled upon the priests (ib,). This was a lower form of anointing; and hence the high priest was sometimes called \"the anointed priest\" (Leviticus 4:5, 16; Leviticus 6:22; Leviticus 16:32, etc.). Their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood. The Rabbinical commentators maintain that these words apply to the ordinary priests only, and on the strength of them establish a difference between the ordinary priests and the high priests. The latter were in every ease to be anointed to their office. A single anointing sainted for the former. It is scarcely necessary to say that there is no Scriptural ground for this distinction. The natural sense of the words is, rather, that as long as the anointing continued, the priesthood should continue.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-33. - The actual setting up of the tabernacle.

This is not a part of the narrative of what was done at this time, but a parenthetic statement of the purpose to which the laver was subsequently applied.

So Moses finished the work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33 - He reared up the court, etc., as directed in ver. 8. So Moses finished the work. With the hanging of the curtain at the entrance to the court, the erection of the tabernacle was complete. It was probably not till after this that Moses performed the acts of worship mentioned in the course of the narrative - put water in the laver (ver. 30), offered sacrifice (ver. 29), lighted the lamps (ver. 25), and burnt incense on the golden altar (ver. 26).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 40:34-38NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34-38. - THE DESCENT OF THE GLORY OF GOD ON THE COMPLETED WORK. The work was finished the fist incense burnt (ver. 27) - the first sacrifice offered (ver. 29). Those who had watched the proceedings, and those who had been engaged in them, were probably about to retire to rest. Even Moses had withdrawn, and left the tabernacle to itself - when suddenly, there was a manifestation of Divine Power. The cloud, which had gone before the Israelites from Succoth onward (Exodus 13:20-22), and which had recently settled upon the extemporised \"Tent of Meeting\" (Exodus 33:9), left its place, and \"covered\" the newly-erected structure externally (ver. 34), while an intensely brilliant light - here called \"the glory of God\" - filled the whole interior of the tabernacle (ib,). Moses, it appears, would fain have re-entered the tabernacle - to see the great sight\" (Exodus 3:3); but he could not - the \"glory\" was too dazzling (ver. 35). Thus a distinct approval was given to all that had been done. God accepted his house, and entered it. The people saw that he had foregone his wrath, and would be content henceforth to dwell among them and journey with them. Henceforth, throughout the wanderings, the cloud and tabernacle were inseparable. If the cloud was lifted a little off it and moved in front, the tabernacle had to follow (ver. 36) - if it settled down on the roof, the people stopped and remained until it moved again (ver. 37). The appearance was as of a cloud by day, and as of fire by night, so that all could always see where the tabernacle was, and whether it was stationary or in motion (ver. 38). After the first descent, it would seem that \"the glory\" withdrew into the Holy of Holies, so that both Moses and the priests could enter the holy place, and minister there (Leviticus 8:10; Leviticus 10:13, etc.). Verse 34. - Then a cloud. In the original \"the cloud,\" i.e. the cloud so often spoken of (Exodus 13:21, 22; Exodus 14:19, 20, 24; Exodus 19:9; Exodus 24:15-18; Exodus 33:9, 10). Covered the tent. Descended on the outer covering and rested there. Filled the tabernacle. Entered inside, and filled both holy place and Holy of Holies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Moses was not able to enter. It is implied that he wished - nay, tried - to enter - but the \"glory\" prevented him. (Compare 1 Kings 8:11; 2 Chronicles 5:14; 2 Chronicles 7:2.) Because the cloud abode thereon. It was not the external \"cloud\" which prevented Moses from entering, but the internal \"glory.\" But the two are regarded as inseparable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36-38. - And when - i.e. \"whensoever.\" The last three verses describe the manner in which the cloud henceforth served the Israelites as guide - not only directing their course, but determining when they were to move, and how long they were to rest at each encampment. For a further account of the same, see Numbers 9:15-23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus40:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - The cloud... was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on. it by night. Compare Exodus 13:21, 22; and Exodus 14:20, 24; Numbers 9:15, 16. The cloud had two aspects - one obscure, the other radiant. It was a dark column by day - a pillar of fire by night. Thus it was always visible.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-17. - The reluctance of Moses to undertake the part of leader, indicated by his first reply at his first calling, \"Who am I that I should go?\" etc. (Exodus 3:11), was not yet overcome. God had promised that he would succeed; but he did not see how he could succeed, either with the people or with Pharaoh. It was not enough for him that God had declared, \"They (the people) shall hearken unto thy voice\" (ib. 18); he does not, cannot believe this, and replies: \"Behold, they will not believe, neither hearken unto my voice\" (Exodus 4:1). This was plain want of faith; but not unnatural, and not, in God's sight, inexcusable. God therefore condescended to the human weakness of his servant, and proceeded to show him how he intended that he should persuade the people of his mission. He should persuade them by producing the credentials of miracles (vers. 2-9). But the laggard heart finds yet a further objection. Moses feels that he labours under a personal defect, which (he thinks) is an absolute disqualification. He is \"slow of speech and of a slow tongue\" (ver. 10), has always been wanting in eloquence, and does not find himself any the more eloquent since God has been speaking with him. In vain does Jehovah promise to \"be with his mouth\" (ver. 12); Moses' last word indicates all the old feeling of self-distrust. \"Send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send\" (ver. 13). Then at last the anger of the Lord is kindled against Moses, and God inflicts on him a sort of punishment - degrades him; as it were - deposes him from the position of sole leader, and associates Aaron with him in such sort that Aaron must have appeared, both to the Israelites and to the Pharaoh, as the chief leader rather than Moses. (See Exodus 4:30; Exodus 7:2, 10, 19; Exodus 8:6, 17, etc.) At this point the interview between Moses and Jehovah ends, and the action of the Exodus commences. Moses obtains leave to quit Midian, and quits it - retires to Egypt, after escaping from a dangerous sickness on the way (vers. 24-26), is met by Aaron and takes him into his counsels, summons the elders and exhibits before them his miraculous powers, persuades them, and is finally accepted as having, with Aaron, a mission from God, both by the elders and the people. Verse 1 - Behold, they will not believe. Attempts have been made to soften down this contradiction of God's words in Exodus 3:18, and to represent Moses as merely saying, \"What if the people will not hearken, etc. What shall I do then?\" (So the LXX., Geddes, Boothroyd, and others.) But the phrase is really emphatic and peremptory. As Rosenmuller says: \"Vox est negantis et detrac-tantis officium.\" The Lord hath not appeared to thee. It is quite probable that the Israelites would have so spoken, if Moses had had no sign to show. There had been no appearance of Jehovah to anyone for above four hundred years. And the Israelites, who had not seen Moses for forty years, would not know whether he was a veracious person or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A rod. Or \"a staff.\" Some suppose the ordinary shepherd's staff, or crook, to be meant; but it is objected that this would have been an unfit object to have brought into the presence of Pharaoh (Kalisch), being unsuitable for a court, and emblematic of an occupation which the Egyptians loathed (Genesis 46:34); and the suggestion is therefore made, that it was the baton or long stick commonly carried by Egyptians of good position and especially by persons in authority. But Moses in Midian, forty years after he quitted Egypt, is not likely to have possessed such an article; nor, if he had possessed it, would he have taken it with him when shepherding. Probably a simple staff, the natural support of a man of advanced years, is meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It became a serpent. The word here used for \"serpent,\" nakhash, is a generic word applicable to any species of snake. We cannot assume that the cobra is the serpent meant, though no doubt Moses, when he fled from before it, believed it to be a venomous serpent. Various reasons for God's choice of this particular sign have been given. Perhaps the best is, that a trick of the kind was known to the Egyptian conjurors, who would be tempted to exhibit it in order to discredit Moses, and would then be discredited themselves by his stick swallowing theirs. (See Exodus 7:10-12.) It is fanciful to suppose a reference either to the serpent of Genesis 3. (Keil and Delitzsch) or to the uraeus (cobra), which the Egyptian kings bore in their headdress as a mark of sovereignty {Canon Cook)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - By the tail. A snake-charmer will usually take up his serpents by the neck, so that they may not be able to bite him. Moses was bidden to show his trust in God by taking up his serpent by the tail. His courage, as well as his faith, is shown in his ready obedience. It became a rod. A veritable rod once more, not a mere stiffened snake like the \"rods\" of the magicians (Exodus 7:12)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - That they may believe. The sign was to convince the Israelites, in the first instance, and cause them to accept the mission of Moses (see vers. 30, 31). It was afterwards to be exhibited before Pharaoh (ver. 21), to try him and prove him, but not to convince him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Furthermore. The first sign is followed by a second, equally simple and easy of performance, and perhaps, in the eyes of the Israelites, even more marvellous. Leprosy in a developed form was regarded as absolutely incurable. (Celsus, 'De Re Medica,' 5:7-8.) Its instantaneous production and removal were contrary to all experience, and in themselves thoroughly astonishing. Further, while the first miracle was simply a sign of supernatural power - a credential, the second was a warning and a lesson. What might not he do to smite or to save on whom God had bestowed such power over the human organism? Each man would naturally fear to resist or disobey one so dangerously gifted. Leprous as snow. The Greek name for the worst form of leprosy, λεύκη, was based on this fact of whiteness. The loathsome disease is thus described by Kalisch: - \"It begins with mealy crusts and scurfy scabs, originally not larger than a pin's point, a little depressed in the skin (Leviticus 13:3, 30), and covered with white hairs (ib. 3, 20). These spots rapidly spread (ib. 8), and produce wild [proud?] flesh (ib. 10, 14). The leprous symptoms appear most frequently on the hairy parts of the body, and also on members which have been ulcerously affected. When the leprosy has gained ground, the whole skin appears glossy white at the forehead, nose, etc., tuberated, thickened, dry like leather, but smooth; sometimes it bursts, and ulcers become visible. The nails of the hands and feet fall; the eyelids bend backwards; the hair covers itself with a fetid rind, or goes off entirely (Leviticus 13:42). All external senses are weakened: the eyes lose their brightness, become very sensitive, and are continually blearing; from the nostrils runs a fluid phlegm.\" ('Comment. on Exodus,' p. 50.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The voice of the first sign. Some understand \"the voice of Moses as he gave them the first sign;\" but it is better to regard the sign itself as speaking to them. According to the sacred writers everything that can teach us anything - day, night, the heavens, the firmament, the beasts, the fowls of the air, the fishes, nay, the very stones - have a voice. They teach us, speak to us, declare to us, cry out aloud, lift up their voice, shout, sing, proclaim God's will, whether man will hear or whether he will forbear. (See Psalm 19:1-3; Job 12:7, 3; Habakkuk 2:11; Luke 19:40, etc.) Equally, or rather much more, must a miracle be regarded as having a voice. God speaks to us by it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - If they will not believe also. \"Even\" would be a better translation than \"also.\" The river is of course \"the Nile.\" See the comment on Exodus 2:3. Of the three signs given, the first would probably convince all those who were religious, well-disposed, and fair-minded; the second, acting upon their fears, would move all but the desperately wicked, who despised Jehovah and put their trust in the gods of the Egyptians (Joshua 24:14; Ezekiel 20:7, 8; Ezekiel 23:3, 8, etc.). The third sign was for these last, who would regard the Nile as a great divinity, and would see in the conversion of Nile water into blood a significant indication that the God who had commissioned Moses was greater than any Egyptian one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And Moses said, O my Lord. The phrase used by Moses is full of force. It is \"vox dolentis et supplicantis\" (Noldius). Joseph's brethren use it to the steward of Joseph's house, when they expect to be fallen upon and taken for bondsmen (Genesis 43:20); Judah used it (Genesis 44:18) when pleading with Joseph for Benjamin; Aaron when pleading for Miriam (Numbers 13:11); Joshua when expostulating with God about Ai (Joshua 7:8). There is a deprecatory idea in it, as well as a supplicatory one; an idea like that which Abraham expanded into the words, \"Oh! let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once\" (Genesis 18:32). Moses feels that he is trying the patience of God to the uttermost; but yet he must make one more effort to escape his mission. I am not eloquent. Literally, as in the margin, \"a man of words.\" \"Words do not come readily to my tongue when I attempt to speak; I have never been a fluent speaker, neither yesterday (i.e. recently) nor the day before (i.e. formerly). Nor do I even find that I have become eloquent by divine inspiration since thou spakest with me. Still I remain slow of speech and slow of tongue.\" A question is raised whether the mere difficulty of finding words and giving them utterance - a difficulty felt at first by almost every speaker - is here meant, or something further, as \"a natural impediment owing to defect in the organs of speech\" (Kalisch), or a want of readiness, owing to disuse, in speaking the Hebrew language (Clarke). The latter suggestion is scarcely consistent with the ease and fluency with which Moses had carried on the conversation in Hebrew up to this point. The former is a possible meaning, though not a necessary one. According to a Jewish tradition, Moses had a difficulty in pronouncing the labials b, v, m, ph, p.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-13. - Who hath made man's mouth! God could and would have cured the defect in Moses' speech, whatever it was; could and would have added eloquence to his other gifts, if he had even at this point yielded himself up unreservedly to his guidance and heartily accepted his mission. Nothing is too hard for the Lord. He gives all powers - sight, and hearing, and speech included - to whom he will. He would have been \"with Moses' mouth,\" removing all hesitation or indistinctness, and have \"taught him what to say\" - supplied the thought and the language by which to express it - if Moses would have let him. But the reply in ver. 13 shut up the Divine bounty, prevented its outpour, and left Moses the ineffective speaker which he was content to be. The words, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send, are curt and ungracious; much curter in the original than in our version. They contain a grudging acquiescence. But for the deprecatory particle with which they commence - the same as in ver. 10, they would be almost rude. And we see the result in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses. The expression used is a strong one, but does not perhaps here mean more than that God was displeased. At least, he did not punish the offender in any severer way than by the withholding of a gift that he was ready to bestow, and the partition between two of a position and a dignity which Moses might have had all to himself. Perhaps diffidence and self-distrust, even when out of place, are not altogether abhorrent to One whose creatures are continually offending him by presumption and arrogance. Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know, etc. This translation is wrong. The two clauses form one sentence, and should be rendered, \"Do I not know that Aaron the Levite, thy brother, speaks well?\" Aaron's designation as \"the Levite\" is remarkable, and seems to glance at the future consecration of his tribe to God's especial service. Behold, he cometh forth to meet thee. It has been conjectured that Aaron designed to visit Moses in Midian, in order to convey to him the intelligence that the king who had sought his life (Exodus 2:15) was dead. He did not, however, start on the journey till God gave him a special direction (ver. 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth. Moses was to tell Aaron what to say - furnish, i.e., the matter of his speeches - and Aaron was to clothe this matter in fitting words. God promised to be with both of their mouths; with Moses', to make him give right directions to Aaron; with Aaron's, to make him utter them persuasively: Moses' position was still the more honourable one, though Aaron's might seem the higher to the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He shall be thy spokesman. Literally, \"He shall speak for thee.\" He shall be, even he. It is the verb that is repeated, not the pronoun. Probably the meaning is, \"he shall surely be.\" There is no comparison between Aaron and anyone else. Thou shalt be to him instead of God. Divine inspiration, that is, shall rest on thee; and it shall be his duty to accept thy words as Divine words, and to do all that thou biddest him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Thou shalt take this rod. Not any rod, but the particular one which had already once become a serpent. Wherewith thou shalt do signs. Rather, \"the signs,\" i.e. the signs which thou wilt have to do, as already declared in Exodus 3:20. It is quite gratuitous to suppose that God had already particularised themNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:18-25NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-25. - If Moses had, as we have supposed, been accepted into the Midianitish nation, he would need permission to withdraw himself from the tribal head. This head was now Jether, or Jethro, Moses' connexion by marriage, perhaps his brother-in-law, perhaps a less near connexion. Nations and tribes were at this time anxious to keep up their numbers, and jealous of the desertion even of a single member. Jethro, however, made no opposition to the return of Moses to Egypt, even though he designed to be accompanied by his wife and sons (ver. 20). Scripture gives no indications of the motives which actuated him. Perhaps the Midianites were at this time straitened for want of room. Perhaps the peculiar circumstances of Moses were held to justify his application for leave. Verse 18. - My brethren probably means here \"my relations\" (compare Genesis 13:8; Genesis 29:12). Moses could scarcely doubt but that some of his countrymen were still living. It would not have been for the interest of the Egyptians to exterminate them. Go in peace means, \"you have my leave - I do not oppose your going.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return. It would seem that Moses was still reluctant, and was delaying his departure, even after he had obtained Jethro's leave to go. Perhaps he was making it an excuse to himself for not setting out that if he returned he might still suffer death on account of the offence which had driven him into exile. To remove this last impediment, God assured him that \"all the men were dead who had sought his life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - His sons. Gershom, already mentioned (Exodus 2:22), and Eliezer (Exodus 18:4), who was probably an infant. Set them upon an ass. Literally, \"the ass,\" i.e. the one ass that belonged to him. The word might best be translated \"his ass.\" When Moses is said to have \"set them upon\" the animal, we need not understand \"all of them.\" Probably Zipporah and her baby rode, while Gershom walked with his father. Though horses were known in Egypt before this, they could not be used in the Sinaitic peninsula, and the employment of an ass by Moses is thoroughly appropriate. Returned. I.e. \"set out to return.\" Took the rod of God in his hand. This is of course the \"rod\" of ver. 2, which had become \"the rod of God\" by the miracle of vers. 3 and 4, and which God had commanded him to take to Egypt (ver. 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21-23. - And the Lord said, etc. Now that Moses had at last given up his own will and entered on the path of obedience, God comforted him with a fresh revelation,, and gave him fresh instructions as to what exactly he was to say to Pharaoh. The statements of ver. 21 are not new, being anticipated in Exodus 3:19-20; but the directions in vers. 22-23 are wholly new, and point to the greatest of all the miracles wrought in Egypt - the death of the firstborn. Verse 21. - All those wonders. The miracles wrought in Egypt are called nipheloth, \"marvels,\" mophethim, \"portents,\" and othoth, \"signs.\" Mophethim, the word here used signifies something out of the ordinary course of nature, and corresponds to the Greek τέρατα and the Latin portenta. It is a different word from that used in Exodus 3:20. In \"all these wonders\" are included, not only the three signs of Exodus 4:3-9, but the whole series of miracles afterwards wrought in Egypt, and glanced at in Exodus 3:20. I will harden his heart. This expression, here used for the first time, and repeated so frequently in chs. 7-14, has given offence to many. Men, it is said, harden their own hearts against God; God does not actively interfere to harden the heart of anyone. And this is so far true, that a special interference of God on the occasion, involving a supernatural hardening of Pharaoh's heart, is not to be thought cf. But among the natural punishments which God has attached to sin, would seem to be the hardening of the entire nature of the man who sins. If men \"do not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gives them up to a reprobate mind\" (Romans 1:28); if they resist the Spirit, he \"takes his holy Spirit from them\" (Psalm 51:11); if they sin against light he withdraws the light; if they stifle their natural affections of kindness, compassion and the like, it is a law of his providence that those affections shall wither and decay. This seems to be the \"hardening of the heart here intended - not an abnormal and miraculous interference with the soul of Pharaoh, but the natural effect upon his soul under God's moral government of those acts which he wilfully and wrongfully committed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Israel is my son. This would be addressing Pharaoh in language familiar to him. Each Egyptian monarch of this period was accustomed to style himself, \"son of the Sun,\" and to claim and expect the constant favour and protection of his divine parent. It was also quite within the range of Egyptian ideas that God should declare himself by word of mouth to his special favourites, and give directions as to their actions. (See 'Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 43.) My firstborn. Not only \"as dear to me as to a father his firstborn\" (Kalisch), but the only nation that I have adopted, and taken into covenant, so as to be unto me \"a peculiar people above all the nations that are upon the earth\" (Deuteronomy 14:2). Israel's sonship is here mentioned for the first time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. For the fulfilment of the threat, see Exodus 12:29. Moses did not utter it till all other arguments were exhausted, and he knew that he was having his last interview with the monarch (Exodus 10:29; Exodus 11:4, 5). In this reserve and in the whole series of his dealings with the Egyptian king, we must regard him as simply carrying out the special directions which, after his return to Egypt, he continually received from the Almighty. (See Exodus 6:11; Exodus 7:9, 15 19: 8:1, 5, 16, 20, etc.)NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:24-26NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-26. - The transition is abrupt from the promise of triumph over Pharaoh to the threat of instant death. But we must bear in mind that some days may have elapsed between the two, and that the sin which provoked the menace was probably not committed at the date of the promise. The narrative of verses 24-26 is obscure from its brevity; but the most probable explanation of the circumstances is, that Zipporah had been delivered of her second son, Eliezer, some few days before she set out on the journey to Egypt. Childbirth, it must be remembered, in the East does not incapacitate a person from exertion for more than a day or two. On the journey, the eighth day from the birth of the child arrived, and his circumcision ought to have taken place; but Zipporah had a repugnance to the rite, and deferred it, Moses weakly consenting to the illegality. At the close of the eighth day, when Moses went to rest for the night, he was seized with a sudden and dangerous illness, which he regarded, and rightly regarded, as a God-inflicted punishment, sent to chastise his sin in breaking the Divine command (Genesis 17:10-12). Zipporah understood the matter in the same way; and, as her husband was too ill to perform the rite, she herself with her own hand cut off her boy's foreskin, and, still indignant at what she had been forced to do, cast it at her husband's feet, with the reproach - \"Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.\" The rite once performed, however reluctantly, God remitted his anger, and. allowed Moses to recover his health, and pursue his journey. Verse 24. - It came to pass by the way in the inn. \"Inns,\" in our sense of the word, were unknown in the East for many ages after the time of Moses, and are still of very rare occurrence. Khans or caravanserais take their place. These are unfurnished buildings, open to all travellers, who thus obtain shelter gratis? but must provide themselves with food, bedding, and all other necessaries. It is questioned, however, if even such a place as this is here meant. Probably, the malon of Moses' time was a mere recognised halting-place, in the vicinity of a well, at which travellers were accustomed to pass the night. The Lord met him and sought to kill him. A sudden seizure, followed by a dangerous illness, is generally thought to he intended (Knobel, Kalisch, Rosenmuller, Canon Cook); but the words seem more appropriate to a miraculous appearance, like that of the angel to Balaam (Numbers 22:31). Still, it is quite possible that nothing more than an illness is meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Zipporah took a sharp stone. Literally \"a stone.\" Stone knives were commonly used in Egypt for making the incisions necessary when bodies were embalmed, and were regarded as purer than iron or bronze ones. Joshua ordered the preparation of stone knives for the circumcision of those born in the wilderness (Joshua 5:2); and the Jews seem to have used stone for circumcision for many ages, though before the compilation of the Talmud they had changed their practice. Cast it at his feet. Not, certainly, the child's feet, but her husband's, to whom at the same moment she addresses herself. A bloody husband. Literally, \"a bridegroom of blood.\" The words are clearly a reproach; and the gist of the reproach seems to be that Moses was a husband who cost her dear, causing the blood of her sons to be shed in order to keep up a national usage which she regarded as barbarous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - So he let him go. i.e. \"God let Moses go\" - allowed him to escape death, accepted Zipporah's tardy act as a removal of the cause of offence, and gave her husband back to her. Then she said, etc. This is not a second address of Zipporah to Moses, conceived in the same terms, but an explanation of her previous address. She called him \"a bloody husband because of the circumcision.\" Literally, \"of the circumcisions.\" The two circumcisions, of Gershom in Midian, and of Eliezer on the way to Egypt, are especially in the writer's mind.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:27, 28NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27, 28. - The scene suddenly shifts. Moses is left in the wilderness to recover his strength and make such arrangements with respect to his wife and children as he thinks best under the circumstances. We are carried away to Egypt and introduced to Aaron, Moses' elder brother, of whom we have only heard previously that he could \"speak well,\" and was to assist Moses as spokesman in his enterprise (Exodus 4:14-16). We now find God revealing himself to Aaron also, and directing his movements, as he had those of Moses. Aaron had perhaps already formed the design of visiting his brother (see ver. 14), and would have sought him in Midian but for the direction now given him. That direction was probably more definite than is expressed in the text, and enabled him to set forth confidently, without the fear of missing his brother. At any rate, under God's guidance he went and met him in the Sinaitic district. The joy of meeting is briefly described in the single phrase \"he kissed him.\" The meeting was followed by a full explanation, on the part of Moses, both of the nature of his own mission and of the part which Aaron was to take in it. Verse 27. - Go into the wilderness. It is scarcely possible that this can have been the whole of the direction given, since the wilderness extended from the shores of the Mediterranean to the extreme point of the Sinaitic peninsula. The sacred writers study brevity, and leave much to be supplied by the common-sense of the reader. He went and met him in the mount of God. Compare above, Exodus 3:1, which shows that Horeb is meant. Horeb seems to have been the name for the entire mountain region, of which Sinai was a part. Kissed him. So Esau kissed Jacob after their long separation (Genesis 33:4), and Joseph, Benjamin and his other brethren (Genesis 45:14, 15). In the East men are more demonstrative than with us. Aaron's kiss showed the gladness that was in his heart (supra, ver. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord. Perfect confidence between the two brothers was absolutely necessary for the success of their enterprise; and Moses wisely, at their very first interview, made Aaron acquainted with the entire series of Divine revelations that had been made to him, keeping nothing back, but communicating to him \"all the words of the Lord.\" Who had sent him. Rather, \"which he had laid upon him.\" (So the LXX., the Vulgate, Knobel, Kalisch, and others.) All the signs. Compare verses 3-9 and verse 23.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:29-31NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-31. - Moses seems to have parted with Zipporah and his children in Horeb, and to have sent them back to Jethro (Exodus 18:2), perhaps because they might have interfered with the work which he had to do, perhaps because he thought Egypt would be no pleasant residence for them during the coming struggle. He journeyed onward from Horeb with Aaron for his sole companion, and had abundant time for taking counsel with him, and exercising the influence over him which high intellect and education combined will always give to their possessor. The journey from Horeb to Goshen occupied probably some weeks. On arriving in Goshen, the two brothers, in obedience to the divine command (Exodus 3:16), proceeded at once to \"gather together all the elders of Israel\" - that is, all these who exercised local authority over their countrymen in the various districts which they inhabited. Through the mouth of Aaron, Moses declared all that had been revealed to him at the burning bush and subsequently, exhibiting at the same time the credentials which proved him an ambassador from God, i.e. the three miracles which he had been empowered to work at any moment (Exodus 4:2-8). The elders, being themselves convinced, summoned an assembly of the people, as is implied though not expressed in ver. 30; and the people, having heard the words of Aaron and seen the signs, were also convinced, and bowing their heads, worshipped the God whose ambassadors had appeared before them. Verse 29. - On the elders of Israel, see note upon Exodus 3:16. It is clear that the Israelitish nation, though in bondage to the Egyptians, had a certain internal organisation of its own, and possessed a set of native officers. These were probably the hereditary heads of families. Moses and Aaron could have no authority to gather these persons together; but they issued an invitation, and it was accepted. The \"elders\" came to the meeting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Aaron spake. Aaron at once entered on his office of \"spokesman\" (ver. 16), declaring to the elders all God's dealings with his brother. Aaron also, and not Moses, us we should have expected (ver. 17), did the signs, God, by allowing him to do them, sanctioning this delegation of power. On later occasions, we find Aaron more than once required by God to work the miracles. (See below, Exodus 7:19; Exodus 8:5, 16.) In the sight of the people. It is not probable that the people were present at the first meeting of the elders; but the sacred historian, anxious to compress his narrative, and bent simply on conveying to us the fact of Aaron's success with both elders and people, omits stages in the history which he supposes that any reader can supply, e.g. the doing of the signs in the sight of the elders, their belief in them, and their subsequent assembling of the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The people believed. This ready faith stands in strong contrast with the ordinary incredulous temper of the Israelitish people, who were \"a faithless and stubborn generation\" - a generation that \"believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation\" (Psalm 78:22). It would seem that under the pressure of affliction - having, humanly speaking, no hope - the stubborn spirit of the people had given way, and they were content to look to Jehovah and accept his promises, and believe in his messengers, notwithstanding their natural scepticism. No doubt the novelty of miracles helped to produce this state of feeling; and the fact that they were not called upon at present for any active exertion made acquiescence in what Moses put before them easier. When they heard that the Lord had visited - i.e. when the message contained in Exodus 3:16 was delivered to them. And that he had looked upon their affliction. Compare Exodus 3:7. They bowed their heads. Rather \"they bowed down\" (Kalisch), or \"inclined themselves.\" And worshipped. Some understand an act of respect and ho-mage done to Moses and Aaron, in token of their acceptance by the people as leaders; but, though the words employed are sometimes used in this sense, the context is opposed to their having this sense in this place. \"When the people heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel they bowed down and worshipped.\" Whom? Surely, the Lord.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And afterward. The interposition of some not inconsiderable space of time seems to be implied. Menephthah resided partly at Memphis, partly at Zoan (Tanis). Moses and Aaron may have had to wait until he returned from his southern to his northern capital. Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh. Aaron was, no doubt, the sole spokesman, but as he spoke for both, the plural is used. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel. Literally, \"Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel.\" Pharaoh would understand Jehovah to be a proper name, parallel to his own Phthah, Ra, Ammon, etc. Let my people go. The rationale of the demand is given in ch. 8:26. The Israelites could not offer their proper sacrificial animals in the presence of the Egyptians without the risk of provoking a burst of religious animosity, since among the animals would necessarily be some which all, or many, of the Egyptians regarded as sacred, and under no circumstances to be killed. The fanaticism of the Egyptians on such occasions led to wars, tumults, and massacres. (See Plutarch, 'De Isid. et Osir.,' § 44.) To avoid this danger the \"feast\" must be held beyond the bounds of Egypt - in the adjacent \"wilderness.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord? Rather, \"Who is Jehovah?\" Either Pharaoh is actually ignorant, or he pretends to be. The former is possible, since Jehovah was a name but little employed, until the return of Moses to Egypt. The latter, however, is more probable. That I should obey his voice. Why am I to obey his voice? What is your Jehovah to me? What authority has he over me? He is, at best, your god, not mine. I know not Jehovah. I acknowledge him not. He is not within the range of my Pantheon. Neither will I let Israel go, i.e. \"nor even, if he were, would I consent to such a request as this from him.\" The Pharaohs assumed to be themselves gods, on a par with the national gods, and not bound to obey them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And they said. Moses and Aaron are not abashed by a single refusal. They expostulate, and urge fresh reasons why Pharaoh should accede to their request. But first they explain that Jehovah is the God of the Hebrews, by which name the Israelites seem to have been generally known to the Egyptians (See Exodus 1:15, 16, 19; Exodus 2:6, 7.) Their God, they say, has met with them - made, that is. a special revelation of himself to them - an idea quite familiar to the king, and which he could not pretend to misunderstand and he has laid on them an express command. They are to go a three days' journey into the desert - to be quite clear of interruption from the Egyptians. Will not Pharaoh allow them to obey the order? If they do not obey it, their God will be angry, and will punish them, either by sending a pestilence among them, or causing an invader to fall upon them with the sword. The eastern frontier of Egypt was at this time very open to invasion, and was actually threatened by a vast army some ten or fifteen years later (Brugsch, 'History of Egypt,' vol. 2, pp. 147-9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The king makes no direct reply to this appeal, but turns upon his petitioners, and charges them with an offence against the crown. Why do they, Moses and Aaron, by summoning the people to meet together, and exciting their minds with vague hopes, \"let the people from their works.\" This is damage to the crown, whoso labourers the people are, and he, the Pharaoh, will not have it. \"Get you - all of you, people and leaders together - to your appointed tasks - your burdens.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The people are many. This is added as an aggravation of the offence charged in the last verse. The people are numerous. Therefore the greater damage is done to the crown by putting a stop to their labours. With these words the first interview between the Israelite leaders and the Egyptian monarch ends. Moses and Aaron, we must suppose, retired discomfited from the royal presence.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:6-9NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-9. - Rulers are not always content simply to refuse inconvenient demands. Sometimes they set to work with much ingenuity and worldly wisdom to prevent their repetition. This is especially the case where they entertain a fear of their petitioners. The Spartans removed Helots, who had earned their freedom, by the Crypteia. The massacre of St. Bartholomew was caused by the Huguenot demand for freedom of worship and the difficulty of repressing it. The Pharaoh now is not content to let things take their course, but devises a plan by which he hopes to crush altogether the aspirations of the Hebrew people, and secure himself against the recurrence of any such appeal as that which had been made to him by Moses and Aaron. The Israelites had recently been employed chiefly in brickmaking. They had had to dig the clay and temper it, to mix it with straw, and mould it into the form of bricks; but the straw had been supplied to them. The king determined that this should be no longer done; the Israelites should find the straw for themselves. It has been estimated that by this change their labour was \"more than doubled.\" (Canon Cook.) It was a not unreasonable expectation that under this system popular meetings would cease (ver. 9); and that Moses and Aaron, not being backed up by the voice of the people, would discontinue their agitation. Verse 6. - The same day. Pharaoh lost no time. Having conceived his idea, he issued his order at once-on the very day of the interview with the two leaders. It would be well if the children of light were as \"wise\" and as energetic on all occasions as the children of darkness. Taskmasters and officers. The word translated \"taskmaster\" here is not the same as the expression similarly rendered in Exodus 1:11; and it is thought not to designate the same class. The sarey massim of the former passage are thought to be general superintendents of works, few in number and of high rank, the nogeshim of the present place to be subordinates, numerous and inferior in position. Both of these classes were probably Egyptians. The \"officers\" (shoterim) were undoubtedly Hebrews. They were especially employed in keeping the tale of the bricks, and seeing that they reached the proper amount. Literally, the word shoterim means \"scribes,\" and is so rendered in most passages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Straw to make brick. Straw was used in Egypt to bind together the clay, or mud, which was, of course, the main material of the bricks. (See Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. p. 2130 It is usually chopped into small pieces. Let them go and gather straw. This would involve the leaving of the brickfields, and the scattering of the people over the harvest-grounds, where alone they would be able to find straw in any quantity. There are so many harvests in Egypt, that straw would perhaps be obtainable somewhere during the greater part of the year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The tale of the bricks - i.e., the number of the bricks. Exactly as many were to be required of each batch of workmen under the new regulation as previously. The demand was one with which, as the king well know, it would be impossible to comply. For they be idle. There was so much ground for the charge as this - that hitherto, their forced labours had not occupied the whole of their time. They had been able, apparently, to cultivate their own plots of ground (Deuteronomy 11:10), to raise crops of cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic (Numbers 11:5), to catch fish (ibid.), and attend public meetings (Exodus 4:30, 31). They had, in fact, had time which they could call their own. Now this was to be so no more. The Pharaoh, however, misrepresents and exaggerates, speaking as if their forced labours had been a mere nothing, and mere want of occupation had led them to raise the cry - \"Let us go and sacrifice.\" It would have been far nearer the truth to say, that the severity and continuousness of their labours had made the notion of festival time, during which they would cease from their toils, generally popular.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Let there more work be laid upon the men. Rather, as in the margin, \"Let the work be heavy upon the men.\" Let the tasks set them be such as to occupy all their time, and not leave them any spare moments in which they may be tempted to listen to mischievous talkers, like Moses and Aaron) who flatter them with vain (literally, lying, words. Pharaoh, no doubt, imagined that the hopes raised by the two brothers were vain and illusive. He was utterly blind as to the course which events were about to take.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:10-14NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-14. - The command of Pharaoh gone forth - no straw was to be provided for the Israelites, they were themselves to gather straw. The taskmasters could not soften the edict; they could only promulgate it (vers. 10, 11). And the Israelites could only choose between rebelling and endeavouring to obey. To rebel seemed hopeless; Moses and Aaron did not advise rebellion, and so the attempt was made to carry out Pharaoh's behest (ver. 12). But experience proved that obedience to it was impossible. Though the people did their best, and the native officers set over them did their best, and the Egyptian taskmasters hurried them on as much as possible (ver. 13), the result was that the tale of bricks fell short. Then, according to a barbarous practice said to be even now not unknown in Egypt (Kalisch), the native officers who Had not delivered in the appointed \"tale of bricks\" were bastinadoed, suffering agonies for no fault of their own (ver. 16), but because the people Had been set an impossible task. Verse 10. - The taskmasters... went out, i.e. quitted the royal palace to which they Had been summoned (ver. 6), and proceeded to the places where the people worked. The vicinity of Zoan was probably one great brickfield. Thus saith Pharaoh. The exact words of Pharaoh. (ver. 7) are not repeated, but modified, according to men's ordinary practice in similar cases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Get you straw where ye can find it. Straw was not valued in Egypt. Reaping was effected either by gathering the ears, or by cutting the stalks of the corn at a short distance below the heads; and the straw was then left almost entirely upon the ground. Grass was so plentiful that it was not required for fodder, and there was no employment of it as litter in farmyards. Thus abundance of straw could be gathered in the cornfields after harvest; and as there were many harvests, some sort of straw was probably obtainable in the Delta at almost all seasons of the year. To collect it, however, and chop it small, as required in brickmaking, consumed much time, and left too little for the actual making of the bricks.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The people were mattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt. The expression used is hyperbolical, and not to be understood literally. A tolerably wide dispersion over the central and eastern portions of the Delta is probably intended. Stubble instead of straw. Rather, \"stubble for the straw.\" Teben, the word translated straw, seems to he properly \"chopped straw\" (stramenta minutim concisa, Cook). The Israelites, who had been accustomed to have this provided for them, gathered now long stalks of stubble in the fields, which they had subsequently to make into teben by chopping it into short bits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13, 14. - The taskmasters hasted them. The Egyptian overseers, armed with rods, went about among the toiling Israelites continually, and \"hasted them\" by dealing out blows freely on all who made any pause in their work. The unceasing toil lasted from morning to night; yet still the required\" tale\" could not be produced; and consequently the native officers, whose business it was to produce the \"tale,\" were punished by the bastinado at the close of the day not giving in the proper amount. Kalisch observes - \"Even now the Arabic fellahs, whose position is very analogous to that of the Israelites described in our text, are treated by the Turks in the same manner. Arabic overseers have to give an account of the labours of their countrymen to the Turkish taskmasters, who often chastise them mercilessly for the real or imputed cf. fences of the Arabic workmen.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:15-19NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-19. - Smarting under the sense of injustice, the Israelite officers \"came and cried to Pharaoh\" (ver. 15), supposing that he could not have intended such manifest unfairness and cruelty. They were conscious to themselves of having done their utmost, and of having failed simply because the thing required was impossible. Surely the king would understand this, if they pointed it out, and would either allow straw as before, or diminish the number of the bricks. But the king had no desire for justice, and did not even pretend to it. He asked for no particulars, ordered no inquiry into the ground of complaint; but turned upon the complainants with the cuckoo cry - \"Idle, idle yourselves - else ye had no time to come here; go, work - go, work.\" Then the officers felt that they were indeed \"in evil case\" (ver. 19) - the king was determined not to do justice - no hope remained - they must be beaten again and again, until they died of the punishment (ver. 21). Verse 15. - Came and cried. The shrill \"cry\" of Orientals when making complaint has often been noticed by travellers, and is probably here alluded to. To Pharaoh. See the \"Introductory paragraph\" at the beginning of the chapter, where it has been noticed that complainants had free access to the presence of Egyptian kings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They say to us. Or, \"they keep saying to us.\" The participle is used, which implies continuance or repetition. The fruit is in thine own people. Literally, \"Thine own people is in fault,\" or \"sins.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Ye are idle, etc. Compare ver. 8. Pharaoh is evidently pleased with his \"happy thought.\" It seems to him clever, witty, humorous, to tax overworked people with idleness; and equally clever to say to religious people - \"Your religion is a mere pretence. You do not want to worship. You want a holiday.\" We may remark further that idleness and hypocrisy were two sins of the deepest dye, according to Egyptian notions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Go therefore now and work - i.e. \"Off with you to the brickfields at once, and get to your own special work of superintendence, which you are neglecting so long as you remain here. It is useless to remain. I reject both of your requests. Straw shall not be given; and the tale of bricks required shall be no less.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The officers... did see that they were in evil case.

It need cause no surprise that they poured out their pent-up indignation upon them. Were not Moses and Aaron the sole cause of the existing state of things? Did not the extreme affliction of the people, did not their own sufferings in the past, did not their apprehended sufferings in the future, originate wholly in the seductive words which the two brothers had addressed to them at the assembly of the people? (Exodus 4:29-31). Accordingly, they denounced, almost cursed their officious would-be deliverers (Exodus 5:21). \"The Lord look upon you, and judge\" between you and us, whether the blame of this whole matter does not lie upon you, its initiators - you have made us to be abhorred in the sight of Pharaoh, and of the Egyptians generally you have brought us into danger of our lives - the Lord judge you!\" Verse 20. - Who stood in the way. Rather, \"who waited to meet them.\" It was not accident, but design, that had brought the two brothers to the spot. They were as anxious as the officers to know what course Pharaoh would take - whether he would relax the burthens of the people or no - whether he would have compassion or the contrary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - They said unto them. The officers were too full of their wrongs to wait until questioned. They took the word, and, without relating the result of their interview, implied it. The Lord look upon you, and judge, they said, meaning \"the Lord (Jehovah) consider your conduct, and judge it\" not exactly, \"condemn it and punish it\" (Keil and Delitzsch) - but \"pass sentence on it,\" \"judge whether it has been right or not.\" We make this appeal because ye have at any rate done us a great injury - ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh. (Note the mixed metaphor, which shows- perhaps rather that \"in the eyes\" had lost its original meaning, and come to signify no more than \"with\" or \"in respect of,\" than that the literal meaning of making a person's savour to \"stink\" did not occur to the writer.) Nay, ye have done more - ye have put a sword in the hand of his servants to slay us. That is to say, \"ye have armed them with a weapon wherewith we expect that they will take our lives.\" Either they will beat us to death - and death is a not infrequent result of a repeated employment of the bastinado - or when they find that punishment unavailing they will execute us as traitors. On the use of the bastinado as a punishment in Egypt, see Chabas, 'Melanges Egyptologiques,' 3me serie, vol. 1. pp. 100-6.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 5:22, 23NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - The two brothers made no reply to the words of the officers. Perhaps their hearts were too full for speech; perhaps they knew not what to say. Whatever faith they had, it did no doubt seem a hard thing that their interference, Divinely ordered as it was, should have produced as yet nothing but an aggravation of their misery to the Israelite people. They could not understand the course of the Divine action. God had warned them not to expect success at once (Exodus 3:19; Exodus 4:21); but he had said nothing of evil consequences following upon their first efforts. Thus we can well understand that the two brothers (and especially Moses, the more impetuous of them) were bitterly grieved and disappointed. They felt their cup of sorrow to be full - the reproaches of the officers made it overflow. Hence the bitterness of the complaint with which this chapter terminates, and which introduces the long series of precious promise, contained in the opening section of ch. 6. Verse 22. - Moses returned unto the Lord. We are not to understand that Moses had forsaken God and now \"returned\" to him but simply that in his trouble he had recourse to God, took his sorrow to the Throne of Grace, and poured it out before the Almighty A good example truly, and one which Christians in all their trials would do well to follow. Lord, wherefore, etc. The words, no doubt, are bold. They have been said to \"approach to irreverence.\" But there are parallels to them, which have never been regarded as irreverent, in the Psalms: e.g. \"O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why does thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?\" (Psalm 74:1) \"How long wilt thou hide thyself? Where are thy former lovingkindnesses? Wherefore hast thou made all men for nought?\" (Psalm 89:46-9), and the like. Kalisch seems right in saying that \"the desponding complaint of Moses was not the result of disbelief or doubt, but the effort of a pious soul struggling after a deeper penetration into the mysteries of the Almighty.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He hath done evil to this people. See above, vers. 7-9, and ver. 14. Pharaoh had increased the burdens of the whole nation, and in this way \"done evil\" to them. He had also brought the punishment of scourging on a number of the chiefs. Neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. The promised deliverance (Exodus 3:8, 20) had not come - there was no sign of it - the people was suffering under a more cruel bondage than ever.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now shalt thou see. There was encouragement in the very word \"now.\" Moses' complaint was, that God delayed his coming, would not show himself, was \"slack concerning his promise.\" In reply he is told that there is to be no longer any delay - the work is just about to commence. \"Now shalt thou see.\" With a strong hand shall he let them go. The \"strong hand\" is not Pharaoh's, but God's. \"By means of my strong hand\" (or \"overpowering might\") \"laid upon him shall he be induced to let them go,\" and similarly with the other clause. Drive them out. This phrase well expresses the final anxiety of Pharaoh to be rid of the Israelites. (See Exodus 12:31, 22.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And God spake. The promise of the first verse was, apparently, given first, and was quite distinct from all the others - perhaps separated from them by an interval of hours, or days. It was especially addressed to Moses. The rest was in the main (ver. 6-8) a message to the people. I am the Lord. Or, \"I am JEHOVAH.\" Compare 3:15, and note ad loc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty. See Genesis 17:1 for the revelation of this name to Abraham, and Genesis 35:11 for its repetition to Jacob. We do not find the full name used by God in any appearance to Isaac; but Isaac himself uses it in Genesis 28:3. By my name Jehovah was I not known unto them. The explanation of this passage is by no means easy. God himself, according to Genesis 15:7, revealed himself to Abraham as Jehovah before declaring his name to be El-Shaddai (God Almighty); and again revealed himself to Jacob as Jehovah-Elohim (Genesis 28:13). Abraham named the place where he had been about to sacrifice Isaac, \"Jehovah-jireh\" (Genesis 22:14). That Moses regarded the name as known even earlier, appears from Genesis 4:1. It was probably as old as language. The apparent meaning of the present passage cannot therefore be its true meaning. No writer would so contradict himself. Perhaps the true sense is, \"I was known to them as a Being of might and power, not as mere absolute (and so eternal and immutable) existence.\" This meaning of the word, though its etymological and original meaning, may have been unknown to the patriarchs, who were not etymologists. It was first distinctly declared to Moses at Sinai (Exodus 3:14, 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I have established my covenant with them. Compare Genesis 15:18-21; Genesis 17:7, 8; Genesis 26:3; Genesis 28:13. The land of Canaan, in a narrow acceptation, reached \"from Sidon unto Gaza\" (Genesis 10:19); in a wider sense it included the whole tract between \"the river of Egypt (Wady-el-Arish) and the great river, the river Euphrates\" (Genesis 15:18). It was this larger tract which was promised by God to Abraham. The land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. Literally, \"the land of their sojourns wherein they sojourned.\" (So Kalisch.) It was by permission of the lords of the soil - the Canaaaites, Perizzites, Hittites, and others, that Abraham and his descendants dwelt in Canaan to the time of Jacob's descent into Egypt. (See Genesis 12:6; Genesis 13:7; Genesis 23:7; Genesis 27:46, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I have also heard the groaning. Compare Exodus 2:24 and Exodus 3:9. The repetition is in consequence of Moses' expostulation (Exodus 5:22, 23), and is to assure the Israelites that God has not forgotten them, but will sustain them under their afflictions, and will shortly deliver them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Say unto the children of Israel. God felt for the disappointment which the people had suffered in finding no alleviation of their toils, but the reverse, after their hopes had been raised high by the words of Moses (Exodus 4:31). He therefore sent them an inspiriting and gracious message. \"They should be rid of their bondage; they should be brought out; they should be redeemed and delivered by his mighty arm and miraculous intervention. He, Jehovah, had said it.\" Faith would lay hold on this assurance and cling to it, even though God still delayed his coming, and did not precipitate matters. A stretched-out arm. Arms are stretched out by men to help and save. An outstretched arm in the Egyptian writing meant \"action.\" The phrase, elsewhere so common, is here used for the first time. (Compare, however, Exodus 3:20.) It was significant of active, energetic help. Great judgments. These had been previously hinted at (Exodus 3:20 and Exodus 4:22) but had not been previously called \"judgments.\" Compare Genesis 15:14: \"Also that nation whom they serve will I judge.\" The plagues of Egypt were not merely \"wonders,\" but punishments inflicted on a proud and cruel nation by a Judge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - The promises are continued, heaped one upon another.NEWLINENEWLINE1.

The land shall be made over to them, and become their own inheritance.NEWLINENEWLINEThe Israelites were formally taken to be God's people at Sinai (Exodus 19:5, 6); where, at the same time, he became (specially but not exclusively) their God (Exodus 20:1; Exodus 29:45, 40). They had evidence that it was he who brought them forth in the pillar of fire and of a cloud (Exodus 13:21; Exodus 14:19, 20, etc.). They were brought into the promised land by Joshua (Joshua 4:1), and given the full possession of it by him and his successors - the various judges and kings, until at last, under David and Solomon, they held the entire tract that had been promised to Abraham (see 1 Kings 4:21; 2 Chronicles 9:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The land which I did swear to give it to Abraham etc. See Genesis 22:16-18; Genesis 26:3, etc. The only formal oath is recorded in Genesis 22:16; but an oath is perhaps implied in every covenant between God and man. God's faithfulness is pledged to the performance of the terms of the covenant on his part. I will give it you for an heritage: I am the Lord. Rather, \"I will give it you for an heritage, I the Lord\" (or \"I Jehovah,\" or \"I the Eternal One\"). \"You have the pledge of my Eternity and Immutability that it shall be yours.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:9NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. The Israelites, who had expected a speedy deliverance, and found themselves only the more down-trodden for Moses' interference, were too much dispirited to be cheered even by the gracious promises and assurances which Moses was commissioned to give. They had no longer any trust in one who they thought had deceived them. He was a dreamer, a visionary, if no worse. They did not intend hearkening to him any more. \"Anguish of spirit\" possessed their souls, and \"cruel bondage\" claimed their bodies, day after day. They had not even the time, had they had the will, to hearken. Verse 9. - Anguish of spirit. Literally, \"shortness.\" Compare Job 21:4. Their spirit was shortened - they had lost all heart, as we say, so cruel had been their disappointment. The contrast between their feelings now, and when Moses first addressed them (Exodus 4:31), is strong, but \"fully accounted for by the change of circumstances\". (Cook). Cruel bondage. Bondage, i.e., far more oppressive and continuous than. it had been (Exodus 5:9-14). The Samaritan version adds: \"And they said to him, Let us alone, and let us serve the Egyptians; for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than die in a wilderness,\" an addition which receives some support from Exodus 14:12.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:10-12NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-12. - The Israelites having shown themselves, for the time, unimpressible, God commands Moses to make his next effort upon the Pharaoh. He is to enter into his presence once more, and demand, without circumlocution or obscurity, that the Israelites be allowed to quit the land (ver. 11). Moses, however, demurs. He had done God's will with respect to the people readily and at once, expecting that, as he had persuaded them before, so he would a second time. But he had been disappointed; the people had refused to listen to him. Immediately all his original self-distrust and diffidence recurred - even the old form of diffidence, distrust of his ability to persuade men (Exodus 4:10). How shall he expect to persuade Pharaoh, who had already rejected him (Exodus 5:2-5), when he bad just failed with his own countrymen, who previously had \"believed\" his report (Exodus 4:31)?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Out of his land. Note the advance in the demand. No longer is there any limitation to a three days' journey, as at first (Exodus 3:18; Exodus 5:3). The children of Israel are to be let go altogether \"out of the land.\" So generally, if God lays a light burthen upon us and we refuse it, we may expect him to exchange our light burthen for a heavier one. We had better accept the first cross he offers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Uncircumcised lips, i.e. \"lips inefficient for the purpose for which lips are given;\" as \"uncircumcised ears\" are ears that cannot hearken (Jeremiah 6:10), and an \"uncircumcised heart\" a heart that cannot understand (Jeremiah 9:26). The meaning is the same as in Exodus 4:10, where Moses says that he is \"slow of speech and of a slow tongue.\" Nothing can be determined from the expression as to the exact cause of the imperfection of which complaint is made.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 6:13-27NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-27. - At this point the narrative is interrupted The author, or (it may be) the final compiler - perhaps Joshua - thought it desirable to insert here a genealogical section, taking up the fatuity history of Israel from the point at which it was left in Exodus 1:5, where the sons of Jacob were enumerated. The whole political system of Israel was based upon the tribal relation; and it was of the last importance, politically, to hand down the divisions and subdivisions of families. The lists here given, probably prepared by Moses in a separate document, had to be inserted somewhere. The present seemed a fitting place. The narrative had reached a turning-point. All the preliminaries were over - the action of the Exodus itself was about to begin. A dramatist would have made Acts 1. end and Acts 2 commence. A poet would have begun a new canto. In the imperfect bibliography of the time, it was thought best to make a division by a parenthetic insertion. Verse 13 seems to belong to what follows rather than to what precedes. There is no emphasis on the words and to Aaron, as if God, having found Moses singly to be irre-sponsive, had now given a charge to both the brothers conjointly (Rashi). Rather the verse is a concise summary of chs. 3-5, prefixed to the genealogy when it was a separate document, and preserved when the compiler placed the document in the textNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - These be the heads of their fathers' houses. By \"fathers' houses\" are meant families (see 1 Chronicles 4:38; 1 Chronicles 5:13; 1 Chronicles 7:40; 1 Chronicles 9:9, etc.); and \"the heads of fathers' houses\" are simply the acknowledged chiefs and founders of families. The main families of the tribe of Reuben were those of Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carrel, actual sons of the patriarch (See Genesis 46:9; and compare 1 Chronicles 5:3.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The sons of Simeon. The list corresponds exactly, both in the names and in the order, with that given in Genesis 46:10, but differs considerably from 1 Chronicles 4:24, and Numbers 26:12. In both the latter places Jemuel appears as Nemuel, and Zohar as Zerah, while Obad is omitted. In 1 Chronicles 4:24, Jachin appears as Jarib. It would seem that the family of Obad died out and disappeared soon after the Israelites quitted Egypt. The family of Shaul, on the other hand, increased and multiplied (1 Chronicles 4:25-27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The sons of Levi. The same three sons are given in Genesis 46:11; Numbers 3:17; and 1 Chronicles 6:2. According to their generations. This phrase is introduced because the writer does not here stop at the sons, but proceeds on to the grandsons, great-grandsons, and other descendants. (See vers. 17-25.) He is concerned especially in this place with the descent of Moses, and therefore with the genealogy of the tribe of Levi, and has only inserted any account of the families descended from Reuben and Simeon, that he might not seem to disregard the claims of primogeniture. The years of the life of Levi. These began about forty or fifty years before the descent into Egypt, which took place after the birth of all his three sons, as appears front Genesis 46:8-11. The length of Levi's life is recorded, not from any chronological considerations, but to show God's blessing upon the family of Moses, which gave such length of days to so many of his ancestors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - The sons of Gershon. The line of Gershon, as the eldest, is taken first. Moses and Aaron are descended from the second son. Shimi is called \"Shimei\" in 1 Chronicles 6:17; but there is no difference in the original.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The sons of Kohath. The same names are given in 1 Chronicles 6:2 and 15. The years of the life of Kohath. Kohath, who was probably about twenty at the time of the descent into Egypt, must have considerably outlived Joseph, who died about seventy years after the descent. His eldest son, Amram, is not likely to have been born much later than his father's thirtieth year. (See Genesis 11:12-24.) Amram would thus have been contemporary with Joseph for above fifty years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The sons of Merari. The same names occur in 1 Chronicles 6:19 and 23. 21, Mahali, by a difference of pointing, becoming Mahli. The Mahlites and Mushites were among the most important of the Levitical families (Numbers 3:33; Numbers 26:58).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Amram. That this Amram is the \"man of the house of Levi\" mentioned in Exodus 2:1, cannot be doubted; but it is scarcely possible that he should be the Amram of ver. 18, the actual son of Kohath and contemporary of Joseph. He is probably a descendant of the sixth or seventh generation, who bore the same name, and was the head of the Amramite house. That house, at the time of the Exodus, numbered above two thousand males (Numbers 3:27, 28). See the excellent remarks of Keil and Delitzsch, 'Biblical Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 470, E. T.; and compare Kurtz, 'History of Old Covenant,' vol. 2. p. 144, and Cook, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 274. Jochebed his father's sister. Marriages with aunts and nieces have been common in many countries, and are not forbidden by any natural instinct. They first became unlawful by the positive command recorded in Leviticus 18:12. The name Jochebed is the earliest known compounded with Jah, or Jehovah. It means \"the glory of Jehovah.\" She bare him Aaron and Moses. Aaron is placed first, as being older than Moses (Exodus 7:7). Miriam is omitted, since the object of the writer is confined to tracing descent in the male line.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The sons of Izhar.

As the heading of the document was kept upon its insertion into the narrative of the Exodus (see the comment on ver. 13), so its concluding sentences were kept, though (according to modern ideas) superfluous. Verse 26. - According to their armies.

The remainder of this chapter is scarcely more than a recapitulation. The author, or compiler, having interposed his genealogical section, has to take up the narrative from verse 12, where he broke off, and does so by almost repeating the words of verses 10-12. The only important addition is the insertion of the words - \"I am the Lord\" (ver. 29), and the only important variation, the substitution of \"Speak thou unto Pharaoh all that I say unto thee' (ibid.), for \"Speak unto Pharaoh... that he let the children of Israel go out of his land\" (ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus6:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - I am the Lord.

He made allowance, and raised his courage and his spirits by fresh promises, and by a call upon him for immediate action. The process of deliverance, God assured him, was just about to begin. Miracles would be wrought until Pharaoh's stubbornness was overcome. He was himself to begin the series at once by casting his rod upon the ground, that it might become a serpent (ver. 9). From this point Moses' diffidence wholly disappears. Once launched upon his Heaven-directed course, assured of his miraculous powers, committed to a struggle with the powerful Egyptian king, he persevered without blenching or wavering until success crowned his efforts. Verse 1. - I have made thee a god to Pharaoh. Moses was diffident of appearing a second time before Pharaoh, who was so much his worldly superior. God reminds him that he is in truth very much Pharaoh's superior. If Pharaoh has earthly, he has unearthly power. He is to Pharaoh \"as a god,\" with a right to command his obedience, and with strength to enforce his commands. Aaron shall be thy prophet, i.e. \"thy spokesman\" - the interpreter of thy will to others.

See the comment on Exodus 4:21. And multiply my signs and my wonders. The idea of a long series of miracles is here, for the first time, distinctly introduced. Three signs had been given (Exodus 4:3-9); one further miracle had been mentioned (ib. 23). Now a multiplication of signs and wonders is promised. Compare Exodus 3:20, and Exodus 6:6, which, however, are not so explicit as the present passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - That I may lay my hand on Egypt. Pharaoh's obstinacy was foreseen and foreknown. He was allowed to set his will against God's, in order that there might be a great display of Almighty power, such as would attract the attention both of the Egyptians generally and of all the surrounding nations. God's glory would be thereby promoted, and there would be a general dread of interfering with his people. (See Exodus 15:14-16; Deuteronomy 2:25; Deuteronomy 11:25, etc.) Bring forth my armies. See the comment on Exodus 6:26. Great judgments.

Rather, \"that I am Jehovah\" - i.e. that I answer to my Name - that I am the only God who is truly existent, other so-called gods being nonentities. They will know this and feel this when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, as I am about to stretch it forth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them. This statement is general, and anticipative of the entire series of interviews beginning here (verse 10), and terminating (Exodus 10:29) with the words, \"I will see thy face no more.\" The obedience of Moses and Aaron was perfect and continuous from this time forward until Egypt was quitted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Fourscore years old. This age is confirmed by the statement (in Deuteronomy 31:2; Deuteronomy 34:7) that Moses was a hundred and twenty at his death. It is also accepted as exact by St. Stephen (Acts 7:23, 30). Moderns are surprised that at such an age a man could undertake and carry through a difficult and dangerous enterprise; but in Egypt one hundred and ten years was not considered a very exceptionally long life, and men frequently retained their full vigour till seventy or eighty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Shew a miracle. It is obvious that there would have been an impropriety in Moses and Aaron offering a sign to Pharaoh until he asked for one. They claimed to be ambassadors of Jehovah, and to speak in his name (Exodus 5:1). Unless they were misdoubted, it was not for them to produce their credentials. Hence they worked no miracle at their former interview. Now, however, the time was come when their credentials would be demanded, and an express command was given them to exhibit the first \"sign.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 7:10-13NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-13. - THE FIRST SIGN, AND ITS FAILURE TO CONVINCE. Obeying the command given them (vers. 2, 9), Moses and Aaron went to the court a second time, and entering into the royal presence, probably repeated their demand - as from God - that the king would let the Children of Israel go (Exodus 6:11), when Pharaoh objected that they had no authority to speak to him in God's name, and required an evidence of their authority, either in the actual words of verse 9 (\"Shew a miracle for you\"), or in some equivalent ones. Aaron hereupon cast down on the ground the rod which Moses had brought from Midian, and it became a serpent (ver. 10). Possibly Pharaoh may have been prepared for this. He may have been told that this was one among the signs which had been done in the sight of the elders and people of Israel when the two brothers first came back from Midian (Exodus 4:30). If he knew of it, no doubt the \"magicians\" knew of it, and had prepared themselves. Pharaoh summoned them, as was natural, to his presence, and consulted them with respect to the portent, whereupon they too cast down the rods which they were carrying in their hands, and they \"became serpents; but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods\" (ver. 12). (For the explanation of those facts, see the comment below). Pharaoh was to some extent impressed by the miracle, but not so as to yield. His heart remained hard, and he refused to let the people go. Verse 10. - Aaron cast down his rod. The rod is called indifferently \"Aaron's rod\" and \"Moses' rod,\" because, though properly the rod of Moses (Exodus 4:2), yet ordinarily it was placed in the hands of Aaron (vers. 19, 20; Exodus 8:5, 17, etc.) It became a serpent. The word for \"serpent\" is not the same as was used before (Exodus 4:3); but it is not clear that a different species is meant. More probably it is regarded by the writer as a synonym.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers. That magic was an object of much attention and study in Egypt is abundantly evident from \"The tale of Setnau\" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 4. pp. 133-148), \"The Magic Papyrus\" (ibid. vol. 10. pp. 137-158), and many other writings. It consisted, to a large extent, in charms, which were thought to have power over men and beasts, especially over reptiles. What amount of skill and power the Egyptian magicians possessed may perhaps be doubted. Many commentators believe them to have been in actual communication With the unseen world, and to have worked their wonders by the assistance of evil spirits. Others, who reject this explanation, believe that they themselves were in possession of certain supernatural gifts. But the commonest view at the present day regards them as simply persons who had a knowledge of many secrets of nature which were generally unknown, and who used this knowledge to impress men with a belief in their supernatural power. The words used to express \"magicians\" and \"enchantments\" support this view. The magicians are called khakamim, \"wise men,\" \"men educated in human and divine wisdom\" (Keil and Delitzsch); mekashshephim, \"charmers,\" \"mutterers of magic words\" (Gesenius); and khartummim, which is thought to mean either \"sacred scribes\" or \"bearers of sacred words\" (Cook). The word translated \"enchantments\" is lehatim, which means \"secret\" or \"hidden arts\" (Gesenius). On the whole, we regard it as most probable that the Egyptian \"magicians\" of this time were jugglers of a high class, well skilled in serpent-charming and other kindred arts, but not possessed of any supernatural powers. The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments. The magicians, aware of the wonder which would probably be wrought, had prepared themselves; they had brought serpents, charmed and stiffened so as to look like rods (a common trick in Egypt: 'Description de l'Egypte,' vol. 1. p. 159) in their hands; and when Aaron's rod became a serpent, they threw their stiffened snakes upon the ground, and disenchanted them, so that they were seen to be what they were - shakos, and not really rods.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - But Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

Rather, \"But Pharaoh's heart was hard.\" The verb employed is not active, but neuter; and \"his heart\" is not the accusative, but the nominative. Pharaoh's heart was too hard for the sign to make much impression on it. He did not see that Moses had done much more than his own magicians could do. As the Lord had said. See ver. 4.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 7:14-21NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-21. - THE FIRST PLAGUE. The first miracle had been exhibited, and had failed. It had been a mere \"sign,\" and in no respect a \"judgment.\" Now the \"judgments ' were to begin. God manifests himself again to Moses, and gives him exact directions what he is to do. He is to meet Pharaoh on the banks of the Nile, and to warn him that a plague is coming upon all Egypt on account of his obstinacy; that the waters of the Nile will be turned to blood, so that the ash will die, and the river stink, and the Egyptians loathe to drink of the water of the river (vers. 15-18). Pharaoh not yielding, making no sign, the threat is to be immediately followed by the act. In the sight of Pharaoh and his court, or at any rate of his train of attendants (ver. 20), Aaron is to stretch his rod over the Nile, and the water is at once to become blood, the fish to die, and the river in a short time to become offensive, or, in the simple and direct language of the Bible, to stink. The commands given by God are executed, and the result is as declared beforehand by Moses (vers. 20, 21). Verse 14. - Pharaoh's heart is hardened. Rather, \"is hard, is dull.\" The adjective used is entirely unconnected with the verb of the preceding verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGet thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - In the morning. The expression used both here and again in Exodus:20 seems rather to imply a daily custom of the Pharaoh. It is conjectured; not without reason, that among the recognised duties of the monarch at this time was the offering of a morning sacrifice to the Nile on the banks of the river (Keil and Delitzsch, Kalisch, etc.). Possibly, however, this may not have been the case, and God may have chosen for certain miracles particular days, on which the king was about to proceed to the river in view of some special ceremony connected with the annual inundation. Against he come. Literally, \"to meet him.\" In their hand. When the time came for smiting the waters, the rod was transferred to Aaron's hand (ver. 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The Lord God... hath sent me unto thee. Rather, \"sent me unto thee.\" The reference is to the original sending (Exodus 5:1). Thou wouldest not hear. Literally, \"Thou hast not heard,\" i.e. up to this time thou hast not obeyed the command given to thee.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord. Pharaoh had declared on the occasion specially referred to, \"I know not Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go\" (Exodus 5:2). He is now told that he shall \"know Jehovah\" in the coming visitation; he shall know, i.e., that there is a great and truly existent God who controls nature, does as he will even with the Nile, which the Egyptians regarded as a great deity; and can turn, if he see fit, the greatest blessings into curses. Behold, I will smite. God here speaks of the acts of Moses and Aaron as his own acts, and of their hands as his hand, because they were mere instruments through which he worked. The Roman law said: \"Qui facit per alium, tacit per se.\" The waters... shall be turned to blood. Not simply, \"shall be of the colour of blood,\" as Rosenmuller paraphrases, but shall become and be, to all intents and purposes, blood. It is idle to ask whether the water would have answered to all the modern tests, microscopic and other, by which blood is known. The question cannot be answered. An that we are entitled to conclude from the words of the text is, that the water had all the physical appearance the look, taste, smell, texture of blood: and hence, that it was certainly not merely discoloured by the red soil of Abyssinia, nor by cryptegamic plants and infusoria. Water thus changed would neither kill fish, nor \"stink,\" nor be utterly undrinkable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The fish... shall die. This would increase the greatness of the calamity, for the Egyptians lived to a very large extent upon fish (Birch, 'Egypt from the Earliest Times,' p. 45), which was taken in the Nile, in the canals, and the Lake Morris (Herod. 2:149). The river shall stink. As Keil and Delitzsch observe, \"this seems to indicate putrefaction.\" The Egyptians shall loathe to drink. The expression is stronger in verse 24, where we find that \"they could not drink.\" We may presume that at first, not supposing that the fluid could really be blood, they tried to drink it, took it into their mouths, and possibly swallowed some, but that very soon they found they could not continue to do so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Say unto Aaron. There is an omission here (and generally throughout the account of the plagues) of the performance by Moses of God's behest. The Samaritan Pentateuch in each case supplies the omission. It has been argued (Kennicott) that the Hebrew narrative has been contracted; but most critics agree that the incomplete form is the early one, and that, in the Samar. version, the original narrative has been expanded. The waters of Egypt... streams... rivers... ponds... pools of water. The waters of Lower Egypt, where this miracle was wrought, consisted ofNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the various branches of the Nile, natural and artificial, which were seven when Herodotus wrote (Herod. 2:17), whence the Nile was called \"septemfluus,\" or \"septemgeminus;\"NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the canals derived from each branch to fertilise the lands along its banks;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) ponds, marshes, and pools, the results of the overflowing of the Nile, or of its percolation through its banks on either side; andNEWLINENEWLINE(4) artificial reservoirs, wherein water was stored for use after the inundation was over. The four terms of the text seem applicable to this four-fold division, and \"show an accurate knowledge of Egypt\" (Cook), and of its water system. The \"streams\" are the Nile branches; the\" rivers correspond to the canals; the \"ponds\" are the natural accumulations of waters in permanent lakes or in temporary pools and marshes; while the \"pools,\" or \"gatherings of waters\" (margin), are the reservoirs made by art. Aaron was to stretch out his rod over the Nile, but with the intent to smite all the Egyptian waters, and all the waters would at once be smitten, the streams and the canals and the natural lakes and the reservoirs. The miracle would even extend to private dwell-trigs, and the change would take place throughout all the land of Egypt, not only in respect of the open waters spread over the country, but even in respect of that stored, as was usual, in houses, and contained either in vessels of wood or in vessels of stone. With respect to these, it is to be observed that the Nile water was much improved by keeping, since the sediment subsided; and that tanks, sometimes of wood, sometimes of stone, were usual adjuncts of all the better class of houses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He lifted up the rod. \"He\" must be understood to mean \"Aaron\" (see ver. 19); but the writer is too much engrossed with the general run of his narrative to be careful about minutia. All that he wants to impress upon us is, that the rod was used as an instrument for the working of the miracle. He is not thinking of who it was that used it. In the sight of Pharaoh. See the comment on ver. 15. And of his servants. Either \"his courtiers generally,\" or, at any rate, a large troop of attendants.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The fish that was in the river died. It is most natural to understand \"all the fish.\" There was blood, etc. Literally, \"and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.\" The exact intention of the phrase is doubtful, since undoubtedly \"in numberless instances, the Hebrew terms which imply universality must be understood in a limited sense (Cook). \"All the land\" may mean no more than \"all the Delta.\"NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 7:24-25NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - On the occurrence of the second sign and first plague, the magicians were again consulted; and, by means which it is impossible to do more the. conjecture, they produced a seeming transformation into blood of a certain quantity of water. The inquiry, whence they procured the water, is answered by ver. 24. That they actually turned water into blood is scarcely asserted in the vague \"did so\" of ver. 22. Perhaps they had recourse to sleight of hand, and made a substitution, like modern conjurors; perhaps they merely turned the water of a red colour. All that was necessary was to convince Pharaoh that they were able to do what Moses and Aaron had done - there was no one to watch, and test, and examine their pretended miracle, which consequently passed muster, though it may have been no more than a trick. Pharaoh, however, suffered himself to be convinced, and \"turned and went into his house\" without paying any attention to the marvel wrought (ver. 23). Verse 22. - The magicians of Egypt did so. They could not do what Moses and Aaron had done - stretch out, that is, a rod over the Nile, and turn it and all its branches, and ponds, and pools, into blood, for this was already done. They could only show their skill upon some small quantity of water in a cup or other vessel. No doubt they produced some apparent change, which was accepted by Pharaoh as an equivalent to what had been effected by the Israelite chiefs, but which must have fallen far short of it. Pharaoh would not be a severe critic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Pharaoh turned - i.e. \"returned\" - quitted the river-hank, satisfied with what the magicians had done, and went back to the palace. Neither did he set his heart to this also. A better translation is that of Booth-royd - \"Nor did he lay even this to heart.\" In the expression \"even this\" there is an allusion to the previous neglect of the first sign (ver. 13).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 7:24, 25NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-25. - Necessity is the mother of invention. Finding the Nile water continue utterly undrinkable, the Egyptians bethought themselves of a means of obtaining water to which they never had recourse in ordinary times. This was to dig pits or wells at some distance from the river, and so obtain the moisture that lay in the ground, no doubt derived from the river originally, but already there before the change of the water into blood took place. This, it appears, remained water, and was drinkable, though probably not very agreeable, since, owing to the nitrous quality of the soil in Egypt, well-water has always a bitter and brackish taste. It sufficed, however, for drinking and culinary purposes during the \"seven days\" that the plague continued (ver. 25). Verse 24. - All the Egyptians digged. Not the Hebrews. The water stored in the houses of the Hebrews in reservoirs, cisterns, and the like, was (it would seem) not vitiated; and this would suffice for the consumption of seven days. Water to drink. Blood would not become water by percolation through earth, as Canon Cook appears to think ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 278); but there might have been sufficient water in the ground before the plague began, to fill the wells dug, for seven days.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus7:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And seven days were fulfilled. This note of time has been regarded as merely fixing the interval between the first plague and the second. But it is more natural to regard it as marking the duration of the first plague. The intervals between one plague and another are nowhere estimated.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Exod.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-7. - THE SECOND PLAGUE. After an interval which there are no means of estimating, the second plague followed the first. Again, while the main purpose of the plague was to punish the nation by which Israel had been so long oppressed, the secondary object of throwing contempt upon their, religion was main-rained. Frogs were among the Egyptian sacred animals. One of their deities, Heka, was a frog-headed goddess; and they seem to have regarded the frog as a sacred emblem of creative power. The great multiplication of frogs, whereby they became an annoyance and a curse, was a trial and strain to the entire Egyptian religious system. The Egyptians might not kill them; yet they destroyed all their comfort, all their happiness. Their animal-worship was thus proved absurd and ridiculous. They were obliged to respect the creatures which they hated - to preserve the animals they would fain have swept from the face of the earth. It is perhaps somewhat difficult for modern Europeans to imagine the plague that frogs might be. The peculiar kind, which has the scientific name of Rana Mosaica, resembles our toad, and is a disgusting object, which crawls rather than leaps, and croaks perpetually. To have the whole country filled with these disgusting reptiles, to be unable to walk in the streets without treading on them, to find them not only occupying one's doorstep but in possession of one's house, in one's bed-chamber, and upon one's bed, to hear their dismal croak perpetually, to see nothing but their loathsome forms whithersoever one looked, to be in perpetual contact with them and feel the repulsion of their cold, rough, clammy skin, would be perhaps as severe a punishment as can well be conceived. Nations are known to have deserted their homes, and fled to a foreign land to escape from it. \"In Paeonia and Dardania,\"says Phoenias, a disciple of Aristotle, \"there appeared once suddenly such a number of frogs, that they filled the houses and the streets. Therefore - as killing them, or shutting the doors, was of no avail; as even the vessels were full of them, the water infected, and all food uneatable; as they could scarcely set their foot upon the ground without treading on heaps of them, and as they were vexed by the smell of the great numbers which died - they fled from that region altogether\"(Eustath. ad Horn. Il. 1 p. 35). In Egypt, the young frogs come out of the waters in the month of September, when the inundation is beginning to subside. Even now they sometimes amount to a severe visitation. Verse 1. - Go unto Pharaoh. The second plague is given simply as a plague, not as a sign. It is first threatened (ver. 2), and then accomplished (ver. 6), an interval being allowed, that Pharaoh might change his mind, and escape the plague, if he chose.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Frogs. The word used for \"frog,\" viz. tseparda, is thought to be Egyptian, and to remain (abbreviated) in the modern dofda, which is in common use, and designates the species known to naturalists as \"Rana Mosaica.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - The river shall bring forth frogs. The frogs do not often come directly out of the river. They are bred in the pools and marshes which the Nile leaves as it is retiring. These, however, may be viewed as detached fragments of the river. Thine house... thy bed-chamber... thy bed. The extreme cleanliness of the Egyptians (Herod. 2:37) rendered this visitation peculiarly disagreeable to them. The frogs under ordinary circumstances do not think of entering houses. Ovens in Egypt were probably baking-pans. These were heated from within by a fire of wood, which was withdrawn after a time and the dough attached by pressure to the interior of the vessels. Kneading-troughs were vessels in which the dough was prepared. Both these and ovens are represented in the Egyptian tombs. (See Rosellini,' Mon. Civ.' pl: 84, 85.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Over the streams... rivers... ponds. See the comment on Exodus 7:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The frogs came up. Literally, \"The frog came up,\" the word being used to designate the class or species.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The magicians did so... and brought up frogs. Here again, as in their imitation of the first plague (Exodus 7:22), sleight of hand may have been the means employed by the magicians; or possibly they may have merely claimed that their enchantments \"brought up\" frogs, which were in reality the consequence of Aaron's act (ver. 2).NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:8-15NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-15. - How long the plague of frogs endured, we are not told. Probably every effort was made, short of intentionally killing them, to get rid of them. Snakes, and chameleons, and ibises would destroy many - others would be crushed beneath wheels, trampled on by animals, squeezed to death by the opening of doors, unintentionally killed by men. But the vacancies made were constantly filled; and there seemed no prospect of the infliction passing away. The influence of his counsellors would under these circumstances be brought to bear upon the mind of the Pharaoh - he would be warned that his subjects were attributing their sufferings to his obstinacy - he would be recommended - perhaps pressed - to yield, and would find in the annoyance which he individually endured a strong motive for compliance. Accordingly, he after a while sent for the two Israelite chiefs, and made the request recorded in the text. Verse 8. - Intreat the Lord - i.e., \"Intreat your God, Jehovah, who has sent this plague, and can doubtless take it away.\" An acknowledgment of Jehovah's power is now for the first time forced from the reluctant king, who has hitherto boasted that \"he knew not Jehovah\" (Exodus 5:2). I will let the people go. The royal word is passed. A positive promise is made. If the Pharaoh does not keep his word, he will outrage even Egyptian morality - he will be without excuse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me. Probably a phrase of ordinary courtesy, meaning - \"I submit to thy will have the honour of my submission.\" When shall I intreat? Literally \"For when\"- i.e., \"for what date shall I make my prayer to God?\" And so Pharaoh's answer is not \"To-morrow,\" as in the Authorised Version, but \"For tomorrow.\" Thy houses. It would seem that the frogs had invaded more than one palace of the Pharaoh. He had perhaps quitted Tanis, and gone to Memphis, when the plague came; but the frogs pursued him there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - To-morrow. See the comment on ver. 9. That thou mayest know. Moses accepts the date fixed by the Pharaoh, and makes an appeal to him to recognise the unapproachable power and glory of Jehovah, if the event corresponds with the time agreed upon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Moses cried unto the Lord. The expression used is a strong one, and seems to imply special earnestness in the prayer. Moses had ventured to fix a definite time for the removal of the plague, without (so far as appears) any special command of God. Hence earnest prayer (as Kalisch notes) was doubly necessary. (Compare 1 Kings 18:36, 37.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The villages. The translation \"courts\" or \"court-yards,\" is preferred by some. Houses in Egypt had generally a court-yard attached to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They gathered them together upon heaps. Literally \"heaps upon heaps.\" And the land stank. Even when the relief came, it was not entire relief. The putrefaction of the dead bodies filled the whole land with a fetid odour.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - When Pharaoh saw that there was respite. Literally, \"a taking of breath,\" i.e., \"a breathing-space.\" He hardened his heart. He became hard and merciless once more, believing that the danger was past, and not expecting any fresh visitation. As Isaiah says - \"Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness\" (Isaiah 26:10). Bad men \"despise the riches of God's goodness and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth them to repentance.\" In this way, they \"treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God\" (Romans 2:4, 5), either in this world or in the world to come. As the Lord had said. See Exodus 3:19; Exodus 4:21; Exodus 7:4. CHAPTER 8:16-19NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-19. - THE THIRD PLAGUE. The breach of promise on the part of Pharaoh (ver. 15), was punished by the third plague, which was inflicted without being announced. It is disputed among the best critics, whether the plague was really one of \"lice\"(as given in the Authorised Version) or of mosquitoes. To the present writer the arguments in favour of mosquitoes seem to preponderate; and he believes the kinnim to represent those subtle pests. Such is the view of the LXX. translators, of Philo, Artapanus, Origen, Rosenmuller, Gesenins, Geddes, Boothroyd, Keil, and Kalisch. Mosquitoes are, under ordinary circumstances, a terrible annoyance in Egypt, when the inundation is going off, especially about October. Their power to annoy is witnessed to in ancient times by Herodotus (2:95), Philo (Vit. Mos. 2. p. 97), and St. Augustine; in modern by Wilkinson and others. That Aaron was ordered to produce them out of \"the dust of the land,\" whereas mosquitoes come from larvae deposited in stagnant waters (Cook), is only a proof that God can transform any kind of matter into any other. He who made man of the dust of the ground (Genesis 2:7) could with still greater ease have transformed that dust into gnats. It is undoubtedly remarkable that the magi-clans could not produce the kinnim; but this disability does not help us to determine what exactly the kinnim were. Conceivably, the magicians were tired of the contest, and feeling that they would ultimately be worsted in it, . withdrew before the circumstances compelled them to withdraw. Verse 16. - Lice. Kinnim - the word is only found here and in the Psalms which celebrate the Exodus (Psalm 78:46; Psalm 105:31). It was understood as \"lice\"by Josephus, the Talmudical writers, Bochart, Pool, and our translators in the reign of James I. But the great weight of authority is in favour of the rendering \"gnats\" or \"mosquitoes.\" See the preceding paragraph. It must also be berne in mind that the nearest Egyptian equivalent, khennems, has the signification of mosquito (Speaker's Commentary, vol. 1. p. 490).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And in beast. Kalisch notes that mosquitoes - molest especially beasts, as oxen and horses, flying into their eyes and nostrils, driving them to madness and fury, and sometimes even torturing them to death.\" He quotes Theodoret, Hist. Ecclesiastes 8:26.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The magicians did so with their enchantments. The magicians stretched out their rods over certain collections of dust, but no gnats were produced; which would be the natural result, if they had made no secret arrangements. No reason can be assigned why they should not have seemed to produce gnats, as easily as frogs, if they had employed all the arts of which they were masters in so doing. But events had convinced them that they could not cope with Moses and Aaron; and it would seem that they therefore declined further contest,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. Or \"of a God.\" It is not probable that the magicians believed in a single God, or intended in what they said to express any monotheistic idea. All that they meant to say was - \"This is beyond the power of man - it is supernatural - some god must be helping the Israelites.\" No doubt they had come to this conclusion by a careful scrutiny of all the miracles hitherto wrought by Aaron. He hearkened not unto them. The magicians were minded to resist no longer; but Pharaoh was otherwise minded. It is quite possible that the mosquito plague did not greatly annoy him. He would probably possess lofty apartments above the height to which the mosquito ascends (Herod. 2:95); or he may have guarded himself by mosquito curtains of the finest Egyptian muslin. His subjects would naturally suffer from such a plague far more than he. As the Lord had said. See the comment on the same phrase in ver. 11NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:20-24 THE FOURTH PLAGUE.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-24. - It has been noticed that - setting apart the last and most terrible of the plagues, which stands as it were by itself - the remainder divide themselves into three groups of three each - two in each group coming with a warning, and the third without. (See Exodus 8:16; Exodus 9:8; Exodus 10:21.) In other respects, no great regularity is observable. There is a general principle of increasing severity in the afflictions, but it does not obtain throughout the entire series. The first three caused annoyance, rather than actual injury, either to persons or property. Of the next three, two were upon property, one upon both property and person (Exodus 9:10). Of the remaining three, two again inflicted injury on property, while one (the plague of darkness) was a mere personal annoyance. The exact character of the fourth plague depends on the proper translation of the word arob. The Jewish commentators connected this word with Ereb and 'Arab, words meaning \"mingled\" or \"mixed;\" and supposed a mixed multitude of animals - beasts, reptiles, and insects - to be meant. But the expression used throughout, which is ha-'arob, \"the arob,\" marks very clearly a single definite species. So much was clear to the LXX., who rendered the word by κυνόμυια, \"the dog-fly,\" which is not the common house-fly (Musca domestica), but a distinct species (Musca canina). Flies of this kind are said to constitute a terrible affliction in Egypt (Philo, De vit. Mos. 2. p. 101; Munk, Palestine, p. 120; etc.); but they attack men chiefly, and do no harm to houses or to the fruits of the field, whereas the 'arob is spoken of as a pest in the houses, and as \"destroying the land\" (verse 24). It has been, therefore, suggested that the Blatta orientalis, or kakerlaque, a kind of beetle, is really intended. These creatures suddenly appear upon the Nile in great numbers; they \"inflict very painful bites with their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and articles of every kind, and either consume or render unavailable all eatables\"(Kalisch). They sometimes drive persons out of their houses; and they also devastate the fields. Verse 20. - Lo, he cometh forth to the water. See Exodus 7:15, and comment. It is suspected that on this occasion Pharaoh \"went to the Nile with a procession to open the solemn festival \"held in the autumn when the inundation was beginning to abate (Cook). Say unto him. Repeat, i.e., the Divine command so often given (Exodus 5:1; Exodus 7:16; Exodus 8:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTElse, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Swarms of flies is an unfortunate translation of a single substantive in the singular number, accompanied by the article. A mixture, etc., is nearly as bad. The writer must mean some one definite species of animal, which he called \"the arob.\" On the probable identification of the animal, see the Introductory paragraph to this Chapter. And also the ground. The 'arob, like the frogs, was to plague them both inside their houses and outside, but especially inside.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - I will sever in that day the land of Goshen. On the position of the land of Goshen, see the Excursus on the Geography. The \"severance\" is a new feature, and one distinguishing the later from the earlier plagues. It was an additional mark of the miraculous character of the visitations, well calculated to impress all thoughtful and honest minds. By all such it would be seen that the God who could make this severance was no local God of the Hebrews only, but one whose power extended over the whole earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A division. Literally \"a redemption,\" i.e., a sign that they are redeemed from bondage, and are \"My people,\" not thine any longer. To-morrow. Particulars of time and place are fixed beforehand, to mark clearly that the visitation does not take place by chance, or by mere natural law, but by Gods positive decree and by his agency.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A grievous swarm of flies. Rather \"a multitude of beetles.\" As with the frogs, so with the beetles, it aggravated the infliction, that, being sacred animals, they might not be destroyed or injured. Beetles were sacred to Ra, the sun-god; and one form of Ra, Chepra, was ordinarily represented under the form of a beetle, or as a man with a beetle for his heath The land was corrupted. Rather \"destroyed;\" i.e. grievously injured, or \"devastated\"(as Kalisch renders). The beetles seriously damaged the growing crops.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 8:25-32NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-32. - The fourth plague moves the Pharaoh more than any preceding one. He still cannot bring himself to grant the demand of Moses; but he offers a compromise. The Israelites shall have a respite from their toils, and be permitted to hold their festival, and offer the needful sacrifices in Egypt (ver. 25). When this offer is for good reasons not accepted, he yields even further - he will let the people go and sacrifice in the wilderness - only they must not \"go far away\"(ver. 28). Having made this promise, he obtains for the second time the intercession of Moses and the discontinuance of the plague in consequence of it. But then, as before, when he saw that there was respite (ver. 15), he retracted his promise, hardened himself, and refused to allow the people to quit Egypt (ver. 32). Verse 25. - In the land - i.e., in Egypt within the limits of my dominions, so that I may not lose sight of you - far less run the risk of losing you altogether.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - It is not meet so to do. So many animals were held sacred by the Egyptians, some universally, some partially, that, if they held a great festival anywhere in Egypt, the Israelites could not avoid offending the religious feelings of their neighbours. Some animals would be sure to be sacrificed - white cows, or heifers, for instance - by some of the people, which the Egyptians regarded it as sacrilegious to put to death. A bloody conflict, or even a civil war, might be the consequence. By the abomination of the Egyptians seems to be meant animals of which the Egyptians would abominate the killing. It has generally been supposed that either cows alone, or \"cows, bulls and oxen\" are meant; but recent researches seem to show that it was only white cows which it was absolutely unlawful to sacrifice. (See 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 90, 96, 99; vol. 10. pp. 44, 62, etc.) Will they not stone us? Death was the legal penalty for wilfully killing any sacred animal in Egypt (Herod. 2:65). On one occasion even a Roman ambassador was put to death for accidentally killing a eat (Diod. Sic. 1:88). Stoning does not appear to have been a legal punishment in Egypt, so that we must suppose Moses to have feared the people present taking the law into their own hands, seizing the sacrificers, and killing them by this ready method.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Three days' journey into the wilderness. This was the demand made from the first (Exodus 5:3) by Divine direction (Exodus 3:18). Its object was to secure the absence of Egyptians as witnesses. As he shall command us. Compare Exodus 10:26, where Moses observes - \"We know not with what we must serve the Lord until we come thither.\" Divine directions were expected as to the number and the selection of the victims.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Only ye shall not go very far away. Here for the first time Pharaoh shows his real objection to letting the Israelites go - he is afraid that they will escape him. So he suggests the compromise, that they shall just enter the wilderness on his eastern border, remaining near the frontier, and therefore within his reach. Moses seems to have made no objection to this proviso. As Kalisch says, \"he committal himself entirely to the guidance and direction of God.\" The three days' journey which he had requested by Divine command (Exodus 3:18) would not take him far beyond the Egyptian frontier. Entreat for me. Compare ver. 8. An abbreviated form is now used, as sufficiently intelligible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - To-morrow. As Pharaoh had fixed the \"morrow\" for the departure of the second plague (ver. 10), so Moses now announces a similar date for the departure of the fourth. He adds a remonstrance against any further deceit or tergiversation, which Pharaoh must have felt to be well deserved.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - There remained not one. The hand of God was shewn in the removal no less than in the infliction of the plagues. The complete disappearance was as abnormal as the sudden coming.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - At this time also.

The word \"cattle\" here is to be taken generally, as including under it the various kinds particularised. The cattle are mentioned as being at this time \"in the field,\" because during the inundation all of them were brought in and housed, while, after the waters had retired, and the land had dried, most of them were turned out to graze. This is always the time at which epidemics break out. The horses, the asses, etc. Horses, which had been unknown prior to the Hyksos invasion, and which consequently do not appear in the list of animals presented to Abraham (Genesis 12:16), first became common under the eighteenth dynasty, when they seem to have been employed exclusively in war. Their use for agricultural purposes, which is perhaps here indicated, was not till later. (See Chabas, Etudes sur l'Antquite' Historic, p. 421.) The ass was employed in great numbers at all times in Egypt. Women and children rode on them, men sometimes in a sort of litter between two of them. They were chiefly used for carrying burthens, which were sometimes of enormous size (Lepsius, Denkmaler, Part 2. pls. 42a, 47, 56, 80c, etc.). The camels. Camels are not represented on any Egyptian monument; but they are occasionally mentioned in the inscriptions (Chabas, Etudes, pp. 400-13). They are called kauri or kamaru. There is no doubt of their employment by the Egyptians as beasts of burthen in the traffic with Syria and with the Sinaitic peninsula.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The Lord shall sever.

This time the king had the curiosity to send out and see whether the Israelites had been spared. Though he found the fact correspond to the announcement, he was not seriously impressed. Perhaps he thought the Israelites took better care of their cattle and were better cattle doctors than his own people. (The doctoring of cattle is represented on the monuments. Rosellini, Mon. Civ. pl. 31.) Or he may have attributed the escape of their animals to the more healthy air of Goshen. Pharaoh's heart was hardened. The plague affected him less than others had done, rather than more. He was so rich that an affliction which touched nothing but property seemed a trivial matter What cared he for the sufferings of the poor beasts, or the ruin of those who depended upon the breeding and feeding of cattleNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 9:8-12NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-12. - THE SIXTH PLAGUE. The sixth plague was sent, like the third, without notice given. It was also, like the third, a plague which inflicted direct injury upon the person. There was a very solemn warning in it; for the same power that could afflict the body with \"boils and blains,\" i.e., with a severe cutaneous disease accompanied by pustulous ulcers - could also (it must have been felt) smite it with death. It is uncertain what exactly the malady was. Some have supposed elephantiasis, some \"black leprosy,\" some merely an eruptive disease such as is even now common m Egypt during the autumn. But it is, at any rate, evident that the malady was exceedingly severe - \"the magicians could not stand before Moses\" because of it (ver. 11). If it was \"the botch of Egypt\" (Deuteronomy 28:27), as seems probable, since the name in the Hebrew is the same, it was incurable. Pharaoh and his people were warned by it that God's power would be shown on themselves, not in the way of mere annoyance - as with the earlier plagues - but of serious injury - and if so, why not of death? Thus, the sixth plague heralded the tenth, and, except the tenth, was the most severe of all. Verse 8. - Ashes of the furnace. Rather \"soot from the furnace.\" The word commonly used in Hebrew for \"ashes\" is different. Many recondite reasons have been brought forward for the directions here given. But perhaps the object was simply to show that as water, and earth (Exodus 8:13) and air (Exodus 10:13) could be turned into plagues, so fire could be. The \"soot of the furnace\" might well represent fire, and was peculiarly appropriate for the preduction of a disease which was in the main an \"inflammation.\" It is not likely that Moses imitated any superstitious practice of the priests of Egypt. Toward the heaven. The act indicated that the plague would come from heaven - i.e. from God. In the sight of Pharaoh. Compare Exodus 7:20 It is probable that the symbolic act which brought the plague was performed \"in the sight of Pharaoh\" in every case, except where the plague was unannounced, though the fact is not always recorded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - It shall become small dust. Rather, \"It shall be as dust.\" No physical change is intended by the expression used, but simply that the \"soot\" or \"ash\" should be spread by the air throughout all Egypt, as dust was wont to be spread. And shall be a boil breaking forth with blains. Literally, \"an inflammation, begetting pustules.\" The description would apply to almost any eruptive disease. The attempts definitely to determine what exactly the malady was, seem to be futile - more especially as diseases are continually changing their forms, and a malady which belongs to the fourteenth or fifteenth century before our era is almost certain to have been different from any now prevalent. The word \"blains\" - now obsolete as a separate word - appears in \"chilblains.\" Ver 10. - The furnace. It is perhaps not very important what kind of \"furnace\" is meant. But the point has been seriously debated. Some suppose a furnace for the consumption of victims, human or other; some a baking oven, or cooking stove; others a furnace for smelting metal; others again a limekiln. The ordinary meaning of the word used, kibshon, is a \"brick-kiln;\" but bricks were not often baked in Egypt. Nor is it at all clear that any victims were ever consumed in furnaces. Probably either a brick-kiln or a furnace for the smelting of metals is meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The magicians could not stand. It is gathered from this that the magicians had, up to this time, been always in attendance when the miracles were wrought, though they had now for some time failed to produce any counterfeits of them. On this occasion their persistency was punished by the sudden falling of the pestilence upon themselves with such severity that they were forced to quit the royal presence and hasten to their homes to be nursed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. Up to this time the hardening of Pharaoh's heart has been ascribed to himself, or expressed indefinitely as a process that was continually going on - now for the first time it is positively stated that God hardened his heart, as he had threatened that he would (Exodus 4:21). On the general law of God's dealings with wicked men, see the comment on the above passageNEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 9:13-26NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-26. - THE SEVENTH PLAGUE. The sixth plague had had no effect at all upon the hard heart of the Pharaoh, who cared nothing for the physical sufferings of his subjects, and apparently was not himself afflicted by the malady. Moses was therefore ordered to appear before him once more, and warn him of further and yet more terrible visitations which were impending. The long message (vers. 13-19) is without any previous parallel, and contains matter calculated to make an impression even upon the most callous of mortals. First there is an announcement that God is about to send \"all his plagues\" upon king and people (ver. 14); then a solemn warning that a pestilence might have been sent which would have swept both king and people from the face of the earth (ver. 15); and finally (ver. 18) an announcement of the actual judgment immediately impending, which is to be a hailstorm of a severity never previously known in Egypt, and but rarely experienced elsewhere. Pharaoh is moreover told that the whole object of his having been allowed by God to continue in existence is the glory about to accrue to his name from the exhibition of his power in the deliverance of his people (ver. 16). A peculiar feature of the plague is the warning (ver. 19) whereby those who believed the words of Moses, were enabled to escape a great part of the ill effects of the storm. It is a remarkable indication of the impression made by the previous plagues, that the warning was taken by a considerable number of the Egyptians, who by this means saved their cattle and their slaves (ver. 20). The injury caused by the plague was very great. The flax and barley crops, which were the most advanced suffered complete destruction. Men and beasts were wounded by the hail-stones, which might have been - as hail-stones sometimes are - jagged pieces of ice; and some were even killed, either by the hail (see Joshua 10:11), or by the lightning which accompanied it. Even trees were damaged by the force of the storm, which destroyed the foliage and broke the branches. Verse 13. - Rise up early. Compare Exodus 7:15, and Exodus 8:20. The practice of the Egyptian kings to rise early and proceed at once to the dispatch of business is noted by Herodotus (2:173). It is a common practice of oriental monarchs. And say unto him. The same message is constantly repeated in the same words as a token of God's unchangingness. See Exodus 8:1-20; Exodus 9:1; Exodus 10:3; etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart. A very emphatic announcement. At this time contrasts the immediate future with the past, and tells Pharaoh that the hour of mild warnings and slight plagues is gone by. Now he is to expect something far more terrible God will send all his plagues - every worst form of evil - in rapid succession; and will send them against his heart. Each will strike a blow on that perverse and obdurate heart - each will stir his nature to its inmost depths. Conscience will wake up and insist on being heard. All the numerous brood of selfish fears and alarms will bestir themselves. He will tremble, and be amazed and perplexed. He will forego his pride and humble himself, and beg the Israelites to be gone, and even intreat that, ere they depart, the leaders whom he has so long opposed, will give him their blessing (Exodus 12:32). That thou mayest know. Pharaoh was himself to be convinced that the Lord God of Israel was, at any rate, the greatest of all gods. He was not likely to desert at once and altogether the religion in which he had been brought up, or to regard its gods as nonexistent. But he might be persuaded of one thing - that Jehovah was far above them. And this he practically acknowledges in vers. 27 and 28.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For now I will stretch out my hand. It is generally agreed by modern writers that this translation fails to give the true sense of the original God does not here announce what he is going to do, but what he might have done, and would have done, but for certain considerations. Translate, \"For now might I have stretched out my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence; and then thou hadst been cut off from the earth.\" Scripture shows that pestilence is always in God's power, and may at any time be let loose to scourge his foes, and sweep them into the pit of destruction. (See Leviticus 26:25; Numbers 11:33; Numbers 14:12; Numbers 16:46; 2 Samuel 24:13-15, etc.) He had not done now what he might have done, and what Pharaoh's obstinacy might well have provoked him to do; and why? On account of the considerations contained in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And in very deed, etc. Rather, \"But truly for this cause have I caused thee to stand,\" i.e., \"kept thee alive and sustained thee in the position thou occupiest\" for to shew to thee my power - i.e., to impress thee, if it is possible that thou canst be impressed, with the greatness of my power, and the foolishness of any attempt to resist it, and also that my name may be declared throughout all the earth - i.e., that attention may be called widely among the neighbouring nations to the great truth that there is really but one God, who alone can deliver, and whom it is impossible to resist.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - As yet. Rather \"still.\" And the whole verse should be rendered - \"Dost thou still oppose thyself against my people, so as not to let them go.\" The verb translated \"oppose\" - (\"exalt\" in the A.V.) - is strictly \"to raise a mound, or bank,\" thence \"to obstruct,\" \"oppose.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - To-morrow about this time. As it might have been thought that Moses had done nothing very extraordinary in predicting a storm for the next day, a more exact note of time than usual was here given. Compare Exodus 8:23; Exodus 9:5. I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail. Rain, and, still more, hail are comparatively rare in Egypt, though not so rare as stated by some ancient authors (Herod, 3:10; Pomp. Mela, De Situ Orbis, 1:9). A good deal of rain falls in the Lower Country, where the north wind brings air loaded with vapour from the Mediterranean; particularly in the winter months from December to March. Snow, and hail, and thunder are during those months not very uncommon, having been witnessed by many modern travellers, as Pococke, Wansleben, Seetzen, Perry, Tooke, and others. They are seldom, however, of any great severity. Such a storm as here described (see especially vers. 23, 24) would be quite strange and abnormal; no Egyptian would have experienced anything approaching to it, and hence the deep impression that it made (ver. 27). Since the foundation thereof. Not \"since the original formation of the country\" at the Creation, or by subsequent alluvial deposits, as Herodotus thought (2:5-11), but \"since Egypt became a nation\" (see ver. 24). Modern Egyptologists, or at any rate a large number of them, carry back this event to a date completely irreconcilable with the Biblical chronology - Bockh to B.C. 5702, Unger to B.C. 5613, Mariette and Lenormant to B.C. 5004, Brugsch to B.C. 4455, Lepsius to B.C. 3852, and Bunsen (in one place) to B.C. 3623. The early Egyptian chronology is, however, altogether uncer-rain, as the variety in these dates sufficiently intimates. Of the dynasties before the (so-called) eighteenth, only seven are proved to be historical, and the time that the Old and Middle Empires lasted is exceedingly doubtful. All the known facts are sufficiently met by such a date as B.C. 2500-2400 for the Pyramid Kings, before whose time we have nothing authentic. This is a date which comes well within the period allowed for the formation of nations by the chronology of the Septuagint and Samaritan versions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field. During winter and early spring, the Egyptians kept their cattle \"in the field,\" as other nations commonly do. When the inundation began (June or July), they were obliged to bring them into the cities and enclosed villages, and house them. The time of the \"Plague of Hail\" appears by all the indications w have been the middle of February. They shall die. Human life was now for the first time threatened. Any herdsmen that remained with the cattle in the open field and did not seek the shelter of houses or sheds would be smitten by the huge jagged hailstones with such force that they would be killed outright, or else die of their wounds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh. It is a new fact that any of the Egyptians had been brought to \"fear the word of Jehovah.\" Probably, the effect of the plagues had been gradually to convince a considerable number, not so much that Jehovah was the one True God as that he was a great and powerful god, whose chastisements were to be feared. Consequently there were now a certain number among the \"servants of Pharaoh\" who pro-fired by the warning given (ver. 19), and housed their cattle and herdsmen, in anticipation of the coming storm.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He that regarded not. If there were men who believed in the power and truthfulness of Jehovah, there were probably more who did not believe. As Lot \"seemed as one that mocked unto his sons-in-law\" (Genesis 19:14), so Moses and Aaron appeared to the great mass of the Egyptians. As observed above, a hail-storm that could endanger life, either of man or beast, was beyond all Egyptian experience, and must have seemed almost impossible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven. The action was appropriate, as the plague was to come from the heaven. Similarly, in the first and second plagues, Aaron's hand had been stretched out upon the waters (Exodus 7:19, 20; Exodus 8:6); and in the third upon \"the dust of the ground\" (Exodus 8:17). And upon every herb of the field - i.e., upon all forms of vegetable life. (Compare Genesis 1:30; Genesis 9:3.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Moses stretched forth his rod. In the last set of three plagues, the earthly agent was Moses (Exodus 9:10; Exodus 10:13, 22), whose diffidence seems to have worn off as time went on, and he became accustomed to put himself forward. Thunder and hail. Thunder had not been predicted; but it is a common accompaniment of a hail-storm, the change of temperature produced by the discharge of electricity no doubt conducing to the formation of hailstones. The fire ran along upon the ground. Some very peculiar electrical display seems to be intended - something corresponding to the phenomena called \"fireballs,\" where the electric fluid does not merely flash momentarily, but remains for several seconds, or even minutes, before it disappears.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24.- Fire mingled with the hail. Rather, \"There was hail, and in the midst of the hail a fire infolding itself.\" The expression used is the same which occurs in Ezekiel 1:4. It seemsNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The hall smote. It is to the hail and not to the lightning that the great destruction of men and beasts is attributed. Such lightning, however, as is spoken of, would probably kill some. All that was in the field. According to the warning given (ver. 19), the herdsmen and cattle left in the open air and not brought into the sheds were killed. The hail emote every herb of the field. Even in our own temperate climate, which is free from all atmospheric extremes, hailstorms occasionally do so much damage to crops that it has been found desirable to organise a special insurance against loss from this cause. Such hail as that described in the text would greatly injure every crop that was many inches above the soil, and entirely destroy such as had gone to ear. (See below, ver. 31.) Broke every tree - i.e., damaged the smaller branches and twigs, thus destroying the prospect of fruit.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Only in the land of Goshen, etc. Compare Exodus 8:22; Exodus 9:4; Exodus 10:23.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 9:27-35NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-35. - The plague of hail impressed the Pharaoh more than any previous one. It was the first which had inflicted death on men. It was a most striking and terrible manifestation. It was quite unlike anything which the Egyptians had ever experienced before (vers. 18, 24). It was, by manifest miracle, made to fall on the Egyptians only (ver. 26). Pharaoh was therefore more humbled than ever previously. He acknowledged that he \"had sinned\" (ver. 27); he added a confession that \"Jehovah [alone] was righteous, he and his people wicked\" (ibid.). And, as twice before, he expressed his willingness to let the Israelites take their departure if the plague were removed (ver. 28). The ultimate results, however, were not any better than before. No sooner had Moses prayed to God, and procured the cessation of the plague, than the king repented of his repentance, \"hardened his heart;\" and, once more casting his promise to the winds, refused to permit the Israelites to depart (vers. 33-35). His people joined him in this act of obduracy (ver. 34), perhaps thinking that they had now suffered the worst that could befall them. Verse 27. - And Pharaoh sent. Compare Exodus 8:8, and 25-28. Pharaoh had been driven to entreat only twice before. I have sinned this time. The meaning is, \"I acknowledge this time that I have sinned\" (Kaliseh, Cook). \"I do not any longer maintain that my conduct has been right.\" The confession is made for the first time, and seems to have been extorted by the terrible nature of the plague, which, instead of passing off, like most storms, continued. The Lord is righteous, etc. Literally, \"Jehovah is the Just One; and I and my people are the sinners.\" The confession seems, at first sight, ample and satisfactory; but there is perhaps some shifting of sin, that was all his own, upon the Egyptian \"people,\" which indicates disingenuousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIntreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Mighty thunderings. Literally, as in the margin, \"voices of God.\" Thunder was regarded by many nations of antiquity as the actual voice of a god. In the Vedic theology, Indra spoke in thunder. The Egyptian view on the subject has not been ascertained.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - As soon as I am gone out of the city. \"The city\" is probably Tanis (Zoan). We may gather from the expression of this verse, and again of verse 33, that Moses and Aaron did not live in the city, but in the country with the other Israelites. When it was necessary for them to have an interview with the king, they sought the city: when their interview was over they quitted it. To obtain for Pharaoh a speedy accomplishment of his wish, Moses undertakes to pray for the removal of the plague as soon as he is outside the city walls. That thou mayest know that the earth is the Lord's. The phrase used is ambiguous. It may mean either \"that the earth is Jehovah's,\" or \"that the land (of Egypt) is his.\" On the whole, perhaps the former rendering is the best. The other plagues sufficiently showed that Egypt was Jehovah's; this, which came from the open heaven that surrounds and embraces the whole world, indicated that the entire earth was his. (Comp. Psalm 24:1: \"The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof: the world, and they that dwell therein.\")NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord. True fear of God is shown by obedience to his commands. Pharaoh and his servants had the sort of fear which devils have - \" they believed and trembled.\" But they had not yet that real reverential fear which is joined with love, and has, as its fruit, obedience. So the event showed. (See verses 34, 35.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The flax and the barley was smitten. Flax was largely cultivated by the Egyptians, who preferred linen garments to any other (Herod. 2:37), and allowed the priests to wear nothing but linen. Several kinds of flax are mentioned as grown in Egypt (Plin. H. N. 19:1); and the neighbourhood of Tanis is expressly said to have been one of the places where the flax was produced. The flax is boiled, i.e. blossoms towards the end of January or beginning of February, and the barley comes into ear about the same time, being commonly cut in March. Barley was employed largely as the food of horses, and was used also for the manufacture of beer, which was a common Egyptian beverage. A certain quantity was made by the poorer classes into bread.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - The wheat and the rie were not smitten, for they were not grown up. In Egypt the wheat harvest is at least a month later than the barley harvest, coming in April, whereas the barley harvest is finished by the end of March. Rye was not grown in Egypt; and it is generally agreed that the Hebrew word here translated \"rie\" means the Holcus sorghum, or doora, which is the only grain besides wheat and barley represented on the Egyptian monuments. The doora is now raised commonly as an after-crop; but, if sown late in the autumn, it would ripen about the same time as the wheat.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The rain was not poured upon the earth. Rain had not been previously mentioned, as it was no part of the plague, that is, it caused no damage. But Moses, recording the cessation as an eye-witness, recollects that rain was mingled with the hail, and that, at his prayer, the thunder, the hail, and the rain all ceased. The touch is one which no later writer would have introduced.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTExodus9:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He sinned yet more, and hardened his heart. Altogether there are three different Hebrew verbs, which our translators have rendered by \"harden,\" or \"hardened\" - kabad, qashah, and khazaq. The first of these, which occurs in Exodus 7:14; Exodus 8:15, 32; Exodus 9:7 and 34, is the weakest of the three, and means to be \"dull\" or \"heavy,\" rather than \"to be hard.\" The second, which appears in Exodus 7:3, and Exodus 13:15, is a stronger term, and means \"to be hard,\" or, in the Hiphil, \"to make hard.\" But the third has the most intensive sense, implying fixed and stubborn resolution. It occurs in Exodus 4:21; Exodus 7:22; Exodus 8:19; Exodus 9:35; and elsewhere. He and his servants. Pharaoh's \"servants,\" i.e. the officers of his court, still, it would seem, upheld the king in his impious and mad course, either out of complaisance, or because they were really not yet convinced of the resistless might of Jehovah. After the eighth plague, we shall find their tone change (Exodus 10:7). Ver 35. - As the Lord had spoken by Moses.
