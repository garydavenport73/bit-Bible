{"Acts.10":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now there was (two last words in italics) for there was (in roman), A.V. and T.R.; Cornelius by name for called Cornelius, A.V. A glance at the map will show that Caesarea (see note to Acts 9:30) was but a short distance, some thirty miles, from Joppa. It was doubtless with a view to Peter's momentous errand to Caesarea that Luke recorded his previous visit to Lydda and his residence at Joppa, consequent upon the restoring of Dorcas to life: the origines of Gentile Christianity being the prime object of the Acts (see Introduction to the Acts). The Italian band; or, cohort (σπείρα). The σπείρα, or cohort, was used in two senses. When spoken of strictly Roman troops, it meant the tenth part of a legion, and consisted of from four hundred and twenty-five to five hundred or six hundred men, according to the strength of the legion. Its commander was called a chiliarch, and it was divided into centuries, each commanded by a centurion. But when spoken of auxiliary provincial troops, it meant a regiment of about a thousand men (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 3:42). It is in this last sense probably that it is used here. Josephus, in the passage above quoted, speaks of five such auxiliary cohorts coming from Caesarea to join Vespasian's army, and he tells us in another place ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:18, 7) that the principal portion of the Roman army at Caesarea were Syrians. It is pretty certain, therefore, that the Italian cohort here spoken of were auxiliaries, so called as being made up in whole or in part of Italians, probably volunteers or velones (Farrar, vol. 1:278, note). Another reason for this conclusion is that it does not seem likely that one of the divisions of a legion should have a name (though it was very common for the legions themselves to be distinguished, in addition to their number, prima, secunda, decima, etc., by such names as Italics, Parthica, Augusta, etc.), but that separate regiments would naturally have appropriate names for the same reason that the legions had. Thus, besides the Italian cohort here named, we have the Augustan cohort in Acts 27:1. It might be important for the security of the procurator, in so turbulent a province as Judaea, to have at least one cohort of Italian soldiers at the seat of government. Renan ('Apotres,' p. 202) thinks the full name of the cohort may have been \"Cohors prima Augusta Italica civium Romanorum;\" and adds that there were in the whole empire not fewer than thirty-two cohorts bearing the name of Italian.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Who for which, A.V. A devout man (εὐσεβής); and in ver. 7. It is an interesting question as to what was the precise religions status of Cornelius, whether he was a proselyte in any technical sense. But the whole narrative, in which he is spoken of simply as a Gentile and uncircumcised, seems to indicate that, though he had learnt from the Jews to worship the true God, and from the Jewish Scriptures read or heard in the synagogue to practice those virtues which went up for a memorial before God, yet he was in no sense a proselyte. It is pleasant to think that there may have been many such in the different countries where the Jews were dispersed (comp. Acts 13:16, and probably Acts 11:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Openly for evidently, A.V.; as it were about for about, A.V. and T.R.; unto for to, and to for unto, A.V. Openly; or, evidently (φανερῶς), indicates the distinctness and certainty of the vision. It was, as Meyer says, a clear angelic appearance; there was no indistinctness or confusion about it, and consequently it left no kind of doubt in the mind of Cornelius. An angel; or rather, the angel; the addition of God defines it (see Acts 5:19, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?

For a memorial; i.e. thy prayers and thine alms are set is the sight of God, and are the cause of his now remembering thee and sending this message to thee.

Two of his household servants (see Acts 9:38, note). Cornelius's faith and piety were like Abraham's - he taught his household to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and judgment (Genesis 18:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Having rehearsed for when he had declared, A.V.; all things for all these things, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now on for on, A.V.; were for went, A.V. The house top; the quietest and most retired place in an Eastern house (comp. 1 Samuel 9:25, 26). It is not inconsistent with this that the hour-top could also be made a place of special publicity, from its height and open space (see Luke 12:3). About the sixth hour. Noon, the second of the three hours of prayer among the Jews, called \"the midday prayer.\" The last was the ninth hour (Acts 3:1) and the first the third hour, nine in the morning (Acts 2:15). See Psalm Iv. 17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Hungry for very hungry, A.V.; desired to eat for would have eaten, A.V. Hungry. The word so rendered (πρόσπεινος) occurs nowhere else either in the New Testament or in any other writer. Possibly he, like Cornelius (ver. 30), had been fasting till the time of prayer. A trance (ἔκστασις) expresses a state of transition from the ordinary state into a new or different state. Applied to a man, it denotes that state in which the external senses and the volition are suspended, and all his impressions are derived from within (see Acts 11:5; Acts 22:17). It is also used to express great astonishment (Luke 5:26; Acts 3:10; Mark 5:42). In the LXX. of Genesis 2:21 it is spoken of Adam's deep sleep, and in Genesis 27:33 of Isaac's exceeding trembling, and elsewhere of strong emotions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He beholdeth the for saw, A.V. ; descending for descending unto him, A.V. and T.R.; were for had been, A.V.; let down by four corners upon the earth for knit at the four corners and let down to the earth, A.V. and T.R. The vessel coming down from the open heavens implied that the command to eat what was contained in it was given by revelation. The things sent were from God, and the command to eat was from God. Peter's hunger had prepared the way for the particular form of the vision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Beasts and creeping things of the earth for beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, A.V. and T.R.; heaven for air, A.V. The distinction between clean and unclean was very sharply drawn in the Levitical Law (Leviticus 11; see especially vers. 41-44 and Leviticus 20:25; Deuteronomy 14:3-20). Peter's astonishment must, therefore, have been exceeding great at the command to slay and eat. And so his answer in ver. 14 shows. And yet our Lord had taught him the same truth (Matthew 15:10-20, or still more distinctly Mark 8:14-23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - And unclean for or unclean, A.V. and T.R. It is rather a striking testimony to Peter's religious character as a Jew before his call to the apostolate, that, poor Galilaean fisherman as he was, unlearned and ignorant, he had yet always conscientiously obeyed the Law of Moses in regard to things clean and unclean (comp. Daniel 1:8-15). The address, Lord (Κύριε), seems certainly to recognize the voice as that of Christ, which also agrees with the descent of the vessel from heaven. The answer is very similar to the refusals in Matthew 16:22; John 13:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A voice for the voice, A.V.; came for spake, A.V.; make not for that call not, A.V. What God hath cleansed, etc. \"The Law was our schoolmaster ['tutor,' R.V.] to bring us to Christ.\" But now, under the gospel of faith, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. There is neither Jew nor Greek. \"Old things are passed away, and all things are become new.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And this for this, A.V.; straightway the vessel for the vessel... again, A.V. and T.R. This was done thrice; i.e. as is clear from the previous \"the second time;\" the same voice addressed to him the third time a direction to eat. The repetition three times of the same injunction was to give certainty (comp. Gem 41:32). For the repetition of the same words, comp. Matthew 26:44. The receiving of the vessel again into heaven merely indicated the termination of the vision. The interpretation of it was to follow ver. 19 and following verses (see especially ver. 28), and was further emphasized by what is related in vers. 44-46 and Acts 11:15-17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Was much perplexed for doubted, A.V.; the for this, A.V.; might for should, A.V.; that for which, A.V.; by for from, A.V.; having made inquiry, stood for had made enquiry, and stood., A.V.

But arise. The but answers the unexpressed idea - Do not hesitate, do not delay, but go at once. For I have sent them. This is one of the many passages which distinctly mark the personality of the Holy Spirit (comp. Acts 8:29; Acts 13:2; Acts 20:28, etc.). Here, too, we may notice the working of God's providence, under whose direction Peter's thoughts and Cornelius's message meet at the same point, like men working from opposite ends of a tunnel and meeting at the same spot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And for then, A.V.; the men for the men which were sent unto him from Coffins, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - A centurion for the centurion, A.V.; righteous for just, A.V.; well reported of for of good report among, A.V.; of God (in italics) for from God (in roman), A.V.; a holy for an holy, A.V.; from thee for of thee, A.V. Righteous; as Matthew 1:19 (comp. the description of Cornelius in ver. 10). The mention here of his being well reported of by all the nation of the Jews is an additional trait (comp. Luke 7:2-5). For the expression, \"of good report\" (μαρτυρούμενος), see Acts 6:3, note. Of God. The rendering, \"warned from God,\" however, fairly represents ἐχρηματίσθη, because χρηματίζομαι does not mean \"to be warned,\" but \"to be divinely warned.\" Ξρηματίζεσθαι παρὰ Θεοῦ ἀποκάλυψιν δέχεσθαι, (Theophylaet). See the frequent use of the word in the New Testament (Matthew 2:12; Luke 2:26; Hebrews 8:5; Hebrews 11:7, etc.). Josephus frequently uses the verb in the active voice in the same sense. To hear words from thee. A Hebrew turn of expression.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen called he them in, and lodged them.

And lodged them is rather a feeble rendering of ἐξένισεν. The same word is rendered entertained in Hebrews 13:2, which is nearer the sense; \"to entertain as a guest.\" The word carries with it that he showed them hospitality, and thus broke down the wall of partition between him and them. \"He gave them friendly treatment, and made them at home with him\" (Chrysostom). (For ξενίζομαι, see ver. 32.) He arose and went forth. This was on the morrow of their arrival. It was two days' journey from Caesarea to Joppa, and two days' journey back again, the distance being thirty miles. They would probably stop the night at Apollonia, which was half-way, on the coast road. Certain of the brethren. The ready missionary spirit of the first disciples is here apparent (comp.

On the morrow. The addition of after in A.V. makes the sense clearer. They entered into Caesarea. A memorable event, being the first invasion of the Roman empire by the soldiers of the cross. His near friends. We have here a proof of the strong faith of Cornelius. He did not doubt the angel's promise (vers. 5 and 6). We see his brotherly love. He invited his friends to come and hear the message of salvation; those whom, as Chrysostom suggests, he had himself brought to a better mind.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - When it came to pass that Peter entered for as Peter was coming in, A.V. The commentators all notice the ungrammatical phrase, ἐγένετο τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν, of the R.T. It seems to be a mixture of two con- structions - ἐγένετο τοῦ εἰσελθεῖν τὸν Πέτρον and ὡς δὲ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ Πέτρος. But probably the T.R. is right. Worshipped him; not necessarily as a god, because προσκυνεῖν (with a dative or an accusative, or, as here, without any case, Hebrew הִשְׁתַחֲוֶה) is constantly used to express that prostration which Orientals practiced before those whom they wished to honor; e.g. Genesis 23:7, 12; Genesis 33:3, 6, 7, etc. But Peter's answer shows that he saw in it greater honor than ought to be paid by one man to another (see Acts 14:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Raised for took, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Findeth for found, A.V.; many come for many that were come, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Ye yourselves for ye, A.V.; to join himself for to keep company, A.V.; and yet unto me hath God showed for but God hath showed me, A.V. Ye yourselves know. It was notorious among the Romans that the Jews kept themselves aloof from other people. Hence the accusation against them, in common with Christians, of being haters of the human race. Tacitus says of them that they hated all people, except their own countrymen, as their enemies, and refused to eat or intermarry with them (\"Separati epulis discreti cubilibus;\" 'Hist.,' 5:5). The word ἀλλόφυλος, one of another nation, occurs only here in the New Testament, but is common in the LXX. often as a synonym for \"Philistines\" (see Judges 3:3, etc.). This rather refutes Meyer's remark that \"the designation (of Gentiles) here is tenderly forbearing.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Wherefore also I came for therefore came I unto you, A.V.; when for as soon as, A.V.; with what for for what, A.V.; ye sent for ye have sent, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer for I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour I prayed, A.V. and T.R.; apparel for clothing, A.V. Four days ago. This was the fourth day (see ver. 23, note). Until this hour, etc. The reading of the R.T. is not adopted by Meyer or Alford, and the R.V. is unintelligible. The A.V. seems to give the meaning clearly and accurately. Until this hour probably denotes the sixth hour, midday, as in ver. 9. Peter's journey would naturally have been taken in the cool of the early morning. Starting at 5 or 6 a.m., five hours, with perhaps an hour's halt, would bring him to the end of his fifteen miles' journey by 11 or 12 a.m. Apparel. The same phrase, ἐσθὴς λαμπρά, is used by St. Luke (Luke 23:11). In the description of the transfiguration a stronger expression is used, ἐξαστράπτων, dazzling.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Saith for said, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSend therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Unto thee for hither, A.V. ; who is surnamed for whose surname is, A.V.; lodgeth for is lodged, A.V.

As regards the truth that God is no respecter of persons, which the present incident had brought home so vividly to Peter's apprehension, there can be no difficulty in understanding it. Cornelius was devout, he feared God, he was fruitful in prayer and almsgiving. God did not say to him, \"All this would have been accepted in a Jew, but cannot be noticed in a Gentile.\" But, Gentile as he was, his prayers and alms went up for a memorial before God. If the things done were good in themselves, they were equally good whoever did them. God is no respecter of persons to accept or reject one or another, because of who he is, and not because of what he does (Ephesians 6:8). The rule is glory, honor, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first and also to the Gentile, for there is no respect of persons with God (Romans 2:10, 11). The word προσωπολήπτης (respecter of persons) occurs only here at all; προσωποληπτέω (to accept or respect persons), once only, in James 2:9; προσωποληψία (respect of persons), Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9; Colossians 3:25; James 2:1. The same idea is expressed by πρόσωπον λαμβάνειν, by which the LXX. render the Hebrew נָשָׂא פָּנִים, and by πρόσωπον θαυμάζειν, by which they also render it and the kindred phrase, חַדַר פָנִים (see Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 10:17, etc.). The first phrase occurs in Luke 20:21 and Galatians 2:6; the latter only in Jude 1:16, where it is rightly rendered in the R.V., \"showing respect of persons.\" Another phrase is ἀπροσωπολήπτως (without respect of persons), 1 Peter 1:17, and βλέπειν εἰς πρόσωπον (to regard the person), Matthew 22:16; Mark 12:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - He for God, A.V.; preaching good tidings of peace for preaching peace, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - That saying ye yourselves know for that word, I say, ye know, A.V.; beginning for and began, A.V. The construction of vers. 36, 37, and 38, is somewhat difficult, but by far the easiest and most natural way, both as regards grammar and sense, is to make ὑμεῖς οἴδατε govern τὸν λόγον directly: You, Gentiles, well know the word which God sent to the Israelites, when he caused the gospel of peace to be preached to them, the word, namely, which came [τὸ γενόμενον ῤῆμα - comp. especially Luke 3:2] throughout all Judaea,\" etc. (ver. 38), \"about Jesus of Nazareth, how that God anointed him,\" etc. In the above sentence, τὸ γενόμενον ῤῆμα is in apposition with τὸν λόγον, but amplifies and explains it; and again Ἰησοῦν τὸν ἀπὸ Ναζαρὲτ, with all that follows down to the end of ver. 39, is a still further explanation of the ῤηγ῀μα, and a summary of that gospel which, as Cornelius already knew, had been preached to the Jews by Jesus himself. The parenthesis, \"He is Lord of all,\" is most opportunely inserted, that his hearers might know that Jesus of Nazareth was Lord of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews. The words λόγος and ῤῆμα are synonymous, as in ver. 44 and in 1 Peter 1:23, 25 (see Luke 3:2; Ephesians 6:17), and are better both expressed by the English word, as in the A.V., than by word and saying, as in the R.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Even Jesus of Nazareth, how that God anointed him for how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth. The reference to the anointing (Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18, 21; Matthew 1:16, 17; Acts 4:27) was necessary to represent him as God's Christ (see Acts 9:22). For the designation, of Nazareth, comp. Acts 2:22; Acts 3:26; Acts 4:10; Acts 6:14; Luke 24:20. Oppressed of the devil. This ascription of disease to Satan agrees with Job 2:7 and Luke 13:16. The word rendered \"oppressed\" (καταδυναστευομένους) occurs in the New Testament only here and James 2:6, but, with its substantive καταδυναστεία, is found repeatedly in the LXX. and the Apocrypha, and in classical Greek, though rarely. A good example of its force is Exodus 1:13, and of the substantive Exodus 6:7. It means \"to rule over oppressively, and by force.\" In the explanatory addition, For God was with him, Peter teaches what our Lord himself and St. John in his Gospel so constantly do, that our Lord's miracles were wrought by the power of God (see e.g. John 5:17, 19, 30; John 7:28; John 8:28; John 9:3, 4; Luke 11:20, etc.). The unity of the Son with the Father would be taught later.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Country for land, A.V.; whom also for whom, A.V. and T.R.; hanging him for and hanged, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHim God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Gave him to be made manifest for showed him openly, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs10:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - That were chosen for chosen, A.V. Peter here again brings forward the special apostolic office of being witnesses of Christ's resurrection (see Acts 1:8, 21, 22; Acts 2:32; Acts 3:15; Acts 4:33; Acts 5:32; Acts 13:31; Acts 26:16, as well as vers. 39 and 42 of this chapter). This constant reference to the testimony of eye-witnesses is an indication of the thoroughly historical character of Christianity, and of the importance of Christian evidences. The new matter which Peter was to bring before Cornelius and his company begins at ver. 40, but with the prefatory remarks in ver. 39, which both attest the truth of what Cornelius already knew and prepare for the following revelation.

He does not appear to have baptized them himself, any more than St. Paul did his converts (1 Corinthians 1:13-17). They prayed him to tarry with them, no doubt that they might receive fuller instruction in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, into which they had been baptized.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Now for and, A.V.; the brethren for brethren, A.V.; also had for had also, A.V, We can imagine how rapidly the news of the great revolution would travel to the metropolis of Jewish Christianity, and what a stir it would maim in that community.

At first sight this phrase, which was natural enough in Acts 10:45, seems an unnatural one in the then condition of the Church, when all the members of it were \"of the circumcision,\" and there were no Gentile converts at all. But the explanation of it is to be found in the circumstance of St. Luke himself being a Gentile; perhaps also, as Alford suggests, in his use of language suited to the time when he wrote. It is an indication, too, of the purpose of St. Luke in writing his history, viz. to chronicle the progress of Gentile Christianity. Peter, having completed his rounds (Acts 9:32), returned to Jerusalem, which was still the abode of the apostles. He was, no doubt, anxious to commune with his brother apostles upon the momentous matter of the Gentile converts; but he was at once attacked by the bigotry of the zealous Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thou wentest in, etc. The circumstance of his eating with Cornelius and his friends is not expressly recorded in Acts 10, but almost necessarily follows from what is there stated. It had been seized upon as the chief sting in their report by those who brought the news to Jerusalem.

Making no distinction. The reading adopted here in the R.T. is διακρίναντα instead of διακρινόμενον in the T.R. The verb διακρίνειν in the active voice means to \"make a distinction\" or \"difference\" between one and another, as in Acts 15:9. But in the middle voice διακρίνεσθαι means \"to doubt\" or \"hesitate,\" as in Acts 10:20. It seems highly improbable that the two passages, which ought to be identical, should thus differ, while employing the very same verb. Some manuscripts, which Afford follows, omit the clause μηδὲν διακρινόμενον altogether.

The fitness of the method adopted by the Divine wisdom for effecting this first reception of Gentiles into the Church upon an equal footing with the Jews is apparent from its success in quieting the jealous prejudices of the Jews, and preserving the peace of the Church. It was still, however, long before the exclusive spirit of Judaism was quenched (see Acts 15. and Galatians 1:6, 7; Galatians 2:4, 11, 12, 13; Galatians 5:2-12; Philippians 3:2, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They therefore that for now they which, A.V.; tribulation for persecution, A.V.; Phoenicia for Phenice, A.V.; speaking for preaching, A.V.; save only to Jews for but unto the Jews only, A.V.

Phoenicia. \"The strip of coast, one hundred and twenty miles long, and about twelve broad, from the river Eleutherus\" to a little south of Carmel, as far as Dora, including, therefore, Sidon and Tyre, but excluding Ceasarea. The name was preserved in the great Tyrian colony of Carthage, as appears in the ethnic forms, Paenus, Punicus, and Paeuicus, applied to the Carthaginians. We are all familiar with the \"Punic Wars,\" Punica fides, the 'Paenulus' of Plautus, etc. Cyprus lies off the coast of Phoenicia, in sight of it, and was very early colonized by the Phoenicians. Philo and Josephus both speak of the Jewish population in Cyprus. Antioch, the capital of the Greek kingdom of Syria, on the river Orontes, built by the first king, Seleueus Nicater, in honor of his father Antiochus, who was one of Alexander the Great's generals. It lay about one hundred and eighty miles north of the northern frontier of Phoenicia. There was a large population of Jews, whom Seleucus attracted to his new city by giving them equal political privileges with the Greeks. It was reckoned by Josephus to be the third city in importance of the whole Roman empire, Rome and Alexandria being the two first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. But there were some of them... who for and some of them were.., which, A.V.; the Greeks also for the Grecians, A.V. and T.R. This last is a most important variation of reading - Ἑλλῆνας, Greeks for Ἑλληνίστας, Grecians, i.e. Grecian Jews, or Hellenists. It is supported, however, by strong authority of manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, and is accepted by Grotius, Witsius, Griesbach, Lachman, Tischendorf, Meyer, Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Westcott, Bishop Lightfoot, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' (apparently) and most modern critics. It is also strongly argued that the internal evidence proves Ἑλλῆνας to be the right reading, because the statement that the men of Cyprus and Cyrene preached the gospel to them is contrasted with the action of the others, who preached to the Jews only. Obviously, therefore, these Hellenes were not Jews. Moreover, there was nothing novel in the conversion and admission into the Church of Hellenistic Jews (see Acts 2:5, etc.; Acts 9:22, 29). And these very preachers were in all probability Hellenists themselves. Bishop Wordsworth, however, on the contrary, defends, though with doubt, the reading Ἑλληνίστας; and argues that even if Ἑλλῆνας is the right reading, it must mean the same as Ἑλληνίστας. He also hints that it might mean \"proselytes\" (see Acts 14:1, where the Hellenes attend the synagogue, and Acts 17:4). But there is no evidence that these were proselytes any more than Cornelius was. The Hellenes, or Greeks, here were probably uncircumcised Greeks who feared God, like Cornelius, and attended the synagogue worship (see Meyer on Acts 14:1). It is very likely that in Antioch, where the Jews occupied such a prominent position, some of the Greek inhabitants should be attracted by their doctrines and worship, repelled, perhaps, by the prevalent superstitions and profligate levity of the great city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - That believed turned for believed and turned, A.V. and T.R. The hand of the Lord; i.e. his power working with them and through them. Compare the frequent phrase in the Old Testament, \"with a mighty hand and a stretched out arm\" (see too Acts 4:30; Luke 1:66).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And the report concerning them for then tidings of these things, A.V.; to for unto, A.V.; as far as for that he should go as far as, A.V. and T.R. The news of this accession of Gentiles to the Church was quickly carried to Jerusalem, with the same motive, probably, that brought thither the account of the baptism of Cornelius and his household, as we read in vers. 1-3 of this chapter. The conduct of the Church in sending so excellent and temperate a person. as Barnabas (as we read in the next verse), the friend of Saul (Acts 9:27) and a favorer of preaching the gospel to Gentiles (Acts 13:1, 2) to inspect the work at Antioch, is an indication that they had already heard the account of the conversion of Cornelius from the mouth of Peter, and were already led to the conclusion, \"Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life!\" There is no clue whatever to the length of time that elapsed between the flight from persecution and the arrival at Antioch, except that Saul had had time to sojourn three years in Arabia, to come to Jerusalem, and from thence to go and settle at Tarsus, where Barnabas found him; thus leaving abundant time for Peter's operations in Judaea and Caesarea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Was come for came, A.V.; he exhorted for exhorted., A.V. Had seen the grace of God; i.e. had seen the number and the truth of the conversions of Gentiles effected by God's grace. He exhorted them all (παρεκάλει πάντας); thus showing himself a true υἱὸς παρακλήσεως, son of exhortation (see Acts 4:36, note). Cleave unto the Lord; προσμένειν, to abide, continue, persevere in (comp. Acts 13:43; 1 Timothy 5:5). In 2 Timothy 3:14 it is simply μένε. The frequent exhortations to perseverance and steadfastness should warn us of the great danger of falling away from the faith, under the pressure of temptation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A good man. The predominant idea in ἀγαθός is simply \"goodness,\" moral excellence. So in Matthew 19:16, \"Good Master.\" To which our Lord answers, \"There is none good but One.\" In Luke 23:50 Joseph of Arimathaea is ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος, \"a good man and a righteous.\" In Matthew 5:45 πονηροὶ καὶ ἀγαθοί, \"the evil and the good,\" are contrasted. In classical Greek the common phrase, καλὸς κἀγαθός, describes an honorable and good man. It is pleasing to read this testimony from Luke, Paul's companion and friend, Full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. So Stephen is described (Acts 6:5) as \"full of faith and of the Holy Spirit.\" The Holy Spirit is spoken of in both places as a Spirit of power and demonstration in preaching the Word. No reason is apparent why the R.T., having altered Ghost to Spirit in Acts 6:5, retains Ghost here. Much people, etc.; the direct consequence of the energy of the Holy Ghost in Barnabas's ministry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And he went forth for then departed Barnabas, A.V. and T.R.; to seek for, for for to seek, A.V. Observe the remarkable providence which had made use of the violence of the Hellenist Jews at Jerusalem to drive Saul to Tarsus, where he would be close at hand to take up the work so unexpectedly prepared for him at Antioch. \"It was in the spring of the year A.D. , or just ten years after the Crucifixion, that Barnabas proceeded to Tarsus, found Saul, and brought him to Antioch\" (Lewin, 1:96). From Seleucia to the port of Tarsus would be about a twelve hours' sail; or, by land, a journey of about eighty miles would bring him to Tarsus from Antioch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people.

The phrase ἐν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ occurs again in 1 Corinthians 11:18 (T.R.), where it has, as here, very nearly the sense of \"in the church,\" as a place of meeting. It should be \"in,\" not \"with.\" The \"Church\" is the assembly of disciples gathered together in their house of meeting. Were called; χρηματίσαι, bore the name cf. It is a peculiar use of the word occurring in the New Testament only in Romans 7:3 besides, but found also in Polybius, Strabo, Josephus, and some other writers. Its common meaning is, in the passive voice, \"to be warned of God,\" as in Acts 10:22, where see note. Christians. It was a memorable event in the history of the Church when the name of Christians, which has distinguished them for nearly eighteen centuries and a half, was given to the disciples of Christ. Hitherto they had been called among themselves disciples, and brethren, and saints, and, by the Jews, men \"of the Way\" (Acts 9:2), or \"Nazarenes\" (Acts 24:5), but now they received the name of Christians, as followers of Christ, from the outside world, and accepted it themselves (Acts 26:28; 1 Peter 4:16). From the Latin form of the word Christians, i.e. followers of Christ (like Herodians, followers of Herod; Marians, Pompeians, partisans of Marius and Pompey; Caesariani, Ciceroniani, Vitelliani, Flaviani, etc.; Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:130; Lewin, vol. 1:97), the designation most have been invented by the Gentiles, either by the Roman court or camp at Antioch, or by the Greek population, influenced as they were by Roman forms of speech current amongst them (compare the Greece-Oriental Nestorians, Arians, etc.). We may be sure that Christians, i.e. followers of Messiah, is not a name likely to have been given by Jews. There is no evidence either of its having been given in derision. The well-known account of Tacitus is \"Vulgus Christianos appella-bat. Auctor nominis ejus Christus, Tiberio imperitante, per Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat\" ('Annal.,' 15:44). Suidas says that those who had been previously called Nazarenes and Galileans, in the reign of Claudius Caesar, when Euodius had been made Bishop of Antioch by Peter, had their name changed into that of Christians. He seems to refer to the statement of Malalas (quoted by Conybeare and Howson, 1:131), that they who had been before called Nazarenes and Galileans received the name of Christians in the time of Euodius, who succeeded St. Peter as Bishop of Antioch, and who himself gave them this name.\" Malalas is thought to have lived somewhere between the sixth and ninth centuries, at Byzantium. A beautiful passage in the Clementine Liturgy is also quoted at p. 130: \"We give thee thanks that we are called by the Name of thy Christ, and are thus reckoned as thine own,\" where the allusion is to James 2:7. The name Christian is frequent in the epistles of Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch; Polycarp's dying words were, \"I am a Christian\" (Bishop Wordsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Now for and, A.V.; there came down for came, A.V.

The news of the accession of the Gentiles to the Church of Antioch would naturally lead to such prophets being either sent by the Church of Jerusalem or coming of their own accord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - A great famine for great dearth, A.V.; over for throughout, A.V.; Claudius for Claudius Caesar, A.V. and T.R. The world; ἡ οἰκουμένη, the inhabited earth, the common expression for the whole Roman empire. But the expression must be taken bore as hyperbolical, just as Josephus says that Ahab sent messengers to search for Elijah, κατὰ πᾶσαν τὴν οικουμένην, where, of course, only the neighboring countries to Judaea can be meant, strictly speaking ('Ant. Jud.,'8. 13:4). But there is no evidence to show that ἡ οικουμένη, is ever a technical term for Judaea. See the use of the word by Luke (Luke 2:1; Luke 4:5; Luke 21:26; Acts 17:6, 31; Acts 19:27; Acts 24:5). In point of fact, the predicted famine, which began in the fourth year of Claudius Caesar (A.D. 44) and lasted till A.D. , fell upon Judea exclusively, as far as appears from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' lit. 15:3; 20. 2:5, 5:2), and was very severe there. Ishmael was high priest at the time; and Helena, Queen of Adiahene, fetched large supplies of corn from Egypt and of figs from Cyprus to Jerusalem, to supply the wants of the people. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8) speaks of this famine as having prevailed \"over the world,\" and as being recorded by authors hostile to Christianity, but mentions no names and gives no particulars ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8), but in the twelfth chapter of the same book he limits it to τὴν Ιουδαίαν, Judaea. There were several other historical famines in the reign of Claudius, but they can hardly be included in the prophecy of Agabus. The prophet Agabus is mentioned again in Acts 21:10, and again as coming from Judaea. Renan ascribes the poverty-stricken condition of the Jerusalem Christians to their communistic institutions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And for then, A.V.; that for which, A.V.

This is the first mention of presbyters, or elders, in the Church at Jerusalem, which was now fully organized. James the Less was the resident apostle (?) and bishop; with him were the presbyters (Acts 21:18); and under them again the seven deacons (Acts 6:5, 6). The presbyters of the Church of Jerusalem are mentioned again in Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23; Acts 16:4; Acts 21:18; James 5:13, where, however, the elders of other Churches in Judaea may possibly be included. A difficulty arises with regard to Saul's mission to Jerusalem with Barnabas, as to how to reconcile it with Galatians 2:1, which speaks of St. Paul's second visit to Jerusalem as taking place fourteen years after his first, whereas this visit could not be above four or five years after. But there are three hypotheses about the visit to Jerusalem referred to in Galatians 2.NEWLINENEWLINE1. The first identifies it with the visit here recorded.NEWLINENEWLINE2. The second identifies it with that related in Acts 15:2, etc., which is supported by most of the best authorities ancient and modern (see note on Acts 15.).NEWLINENEWLINE3. The third, which is advocated by Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1:302, etc.), identifies it with the visit recorded in Acts 18:22. As regards the first, with which we are now concerned, though at first sight you would have ex-peered St. Paul's next visit to Jerusalem after his conversion to be the one alluded to in Galatians it., yet the following circumstances make this impossible.NEWLINENEWLINE(1) The date of the visit named in Galatians it, which is distinctly stated to be fourteen years after that recorded in Acts 9:26 (ἔπειτα διὰ δεκατεσσάρων ἐτῶν πάλιν ἀνέβην κ.τ.λ.).NEWLINENEWLINE(2) When St. Paul went to Jerusalem on the occasion adverted to in Galatians it.,\" he laid before them the gospel which he preached among the Gentiles.\" But at the time of this visit he had not yet begun his labors among the Gentiles (ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσι), to which he was only called after his return (Acts 13:2).NEWLINENEWLINE(3) On the occasion spoken of in Galatians it, Paul and Barnabas were received by the chief apostles, and must have passed a considerable time at Jerusalem, with many consultations and meetings, public and private. But on this occasion, as far as appears, their visit was a very hasty one, and they saw no one but the presbyters, and returned as soon as they had handed over the collection to them (Acts 12:25). The conclusion, therefore, seems quite certain that this is not the visit referred to in Galatians it. And the hasty nature of this visit explains at once why St. Paul made no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. It had no bearing upon the course of his argument. It was not a visit to Jerusalem in the sense in which he was speaking, and he saw none of the apostles. The state of the Church at the time, James the son of Zebedee killed, Peter in prison or lately escaped \"to another place\" (Acts 12:17), the other apostles very likely dispersed, made it impossible. He therefore took no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. This seems quite a sufficient explanation (see the note of Bishop Ellicott on Galatians 2:1, and Bishop Lightfoot's convincing remarks at p. 113 of his 'Epistle to the Galatians'). There is no occasion to resort to the violent expedient of Renan, and say that Saul did not go with Barnabas at this time.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Put for stretched, A.V.; afflict for vex, A.V. The phrase, About that time, as in Acts 19:23, points to what had just before been related (Meyer). The interposition of the narrative in this chapter between Acts 11:20 and Acts 12:25 evidently implies that the bulk or rather the chief of the events narrated happened in the interval. Which of the events was the chief in the mind of the narrator with reference to his general narrative, and what are the coincidences which he wished to note, it is not easy to say with certainty. The narrative in this chapter doubtless overlaps at both ends the embassy of Paul and Barnabas, but perhaps the object was to show the harassed state of the Church from famine and persecution at the time that Paul and Barnabas were at Jerusalem. Herod the king here mentioned is Herod Agrippa I., grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. During the reign of Tiberius he resided at Rome, in alternate favor and disgrace, sometimes banished, sometimes a prisoner, sometimes a guest at the imperial court. He was a great friend of Caius Caesar Caligula, and, on his succeeding to the empire on the death of Tiberius, was promoted by him to the tetrarchy of Herod Philip, with the title of king. He was further advanced three years afterwards to the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas; and, on the accession of Claudius to the throne, Judaea and Samaria were added to his dominions, which now comprised the whole kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great. Agrippa, in spite of his close intimacy with Drusus, Caligula, Claudius, and other Roman magnates, was \"exactly careful in the observance of the laws of his country, not allowing a day to pass without its appointed sacrifice;\" and he had given proof of his strong Jewish feeling by interposing his whole influence with Caligula to prevent his statue being placed in the holy of holies. This spirit accounts for his enmity against the Church. He was a man of very expensive and luxurious habits, but not without some great qualities.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he killed James the brother of John with the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - James, the son of Zebedee, or James the Elder, to whom, with his brother John, our Lord gave the surname of Boanerges (which is a corruption of בְנֵי דֶגֶשׁ), sons of thunder. Nothing is recorded of him in the Acts but his presence in the upper room at Jerusalem after the Ascension (Acts 1:13), and this his martyrdom, which was the fulfillment of our Lord's prediction in Matthew 20:23. His being singled out by Herod for death in company with Peter is rather an indication of his zeal and activity in the Lord's service, though we know nothing of his work. Eusebius relates an anecdote of his martyrdom, extracted from the lost work of Clement of Alexandria, called the Ὑποτυτώσεις (or in Latin Adumbrationes), which Clement professed to have received by tradition from his predecessors, to the effect that the informer who accused James was so struck with his constancy in confessing Christ before the judge, that he came forward and confessed himself a Christian too. The two were then led off to execution together; and on the way the informer asked James's forgiveness. After a moment's hesitation, James said to him, \"Peace be unto thee,\" and kissed him. They were then both beheaded ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 9.). As Clement flourished about A.D. , the tradition need not have passed through more than three persons. It has been thought strange that Luke relates the death of a chief apostle with such brevity. But it did not bear on the main object of his work. Lightfoot ('Works,' vol. 8. p. 282, etc.) mentions a fanciful story related by Rabauus Maurus, that about this time the apostles composed the Apostles' Creed, each contributing one clause, and that the clause contributed by James the brother of John was, \"And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.

He proceeded to seize (προσέθετο συλλαβεῖν) is a Hebraism. This trait of his pleasing the Jews is in exact accordance with Josephus's description of him, as τῷ βιοῦν ἐν αὐφημίᾳ χαίρων, loving popularity, and as being very kind and sympathizing with the Jewish people, and liking to live much at Jerusalem ('Ant. Jud.' 19.7.3). The days of unleavened bread; i.e. as expressed by Luke 22:1, \"The Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover.\" It lasted seven days (Exodus 12:15-18), from the 14th to the 21st of Nisan, or Abib (Exodus 12:18-20; Leviticus 23:5, 6; Deuteronomy 16:1-4), the Passover being eaten on the night of the 14th.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Taken for apprehended, A.V.; guard for keep, A.V.; the Passover for Easter, A.V. Four quaternions; i.e. four bands of four soldiers each, which were on guard in succession through the four watches of the night - one quaternion for each watch. The Passover. This is a decided improve-merit, as the use of the word \"Easter\" implies that the Christian feast is here meant. But perhaps\" Feast of the Passover\" would have been better, as showing that the whole seven days are intended. This is, perhaps, the meaning of τὸ πάσχα in John 18:28, and certainly is its meaning here. We have another characteristic trait of the religion of Agrippa, and of his sympathy with the feelings of the Jews about the Law, that he would not allow a trial on a capital charge, or an execution, to take place during the Feast of Unleavened Bread (comp. John 18:8). To bring him forth to the people. Still the same desire uppermost, to propitiate the people by gifts or shows, or by blood; ἀναγαγεῖν means exactly \"to bring up\" (Acts 9:39; Romans 10:7, etc.), either on to a stage or on some high ground, where all the people could see him condemned, which would be as good to them as an auto da fé to a Spanish mob, or a gladiatorial slaughter to a Roman audience (see ver. 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPeter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The prison for prison, A.V.; earnestly for without ceasing, A.V. (ἐκτενὴς, or as in the R.T. ἐκτενῶς, has the sense of intensity rather than duration; see Luke 22:14, T.R.; 1 Peter 1:22; 1 Peter 4:8). As the last of the days of unleavened bread approached, the prayers of the Church would be more and more intense in their earnestness. We have but to read the preceding chapters to judge how precious to the Church the life of Peter must have been.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Was about to bring for would have brought, A.V.; guards for the keepers, A.V. What a picture we have here! The dungeon; the double chain fastening the prisoner to two soldiers; the other two soldiers of the quaternion keeping watch at the first and second ward, or station; the iron gate securely fastened; the population of the great city expecting with the morning light to be gratified with the blood of the victim of their bigotry; the king having made his arrangements for the imposing spectacle which was to ingratiate him with his people and obtain the applause he so dearly loved; and then the servant of Jesus Christ sleeping calmly under the shadow of God's wings; and, a little way off, the Church keeping her solemn watch and pouring forth her intensest prayers through the silence of the night! And the issue, the triumph of the few and the weak over all the power of the many and the strong.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.

It only occurs here in the New Testament, though it is a common Greek word. His chains fell off from his hands, showing that each hand bad been chained to a soldier. The loosening of the chains would enable him to rise without necessarily awakening the soldiers to whom he was fastened, and who would feel no difference in the chain which was attached to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.

Peter's recognition of the Lord's hand in sending his angel is exactly echoed in the Collect for Michaelmas Day, \"Grant that as thy holy angels always do thee service in heaven, so by thy appointment they may succor and defend us on earth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And were praying for praying, A.V. When he had considered; better, with Meyer and Alford, when he perceived it, viz. the truth of his deliverance. Mary the mother of John was aunt to Barnabas (Colossians 4:10). If Paul and Barnabas were not in her house at the time (which there is no evidence that they were), it is likely that all the particulars of Peter's escape may have been communicated to Paul by John Mark, and by him repeated to Luke. That they went to the house of Mary before their return seems certain from their taking Mark with them to Antioch (ver. 25), possibly to deliver him from the danger Christians were in at Jerusalem at this time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - When he for as Peter, A.V. and T.R.; maid for damsel, A.V.; to answer for to hearken, A.V.

It is the phrase proper to a doorkeeper, whoso business it is to go to the door and listen when any one knocks, and find out what their business is before opening the door. This is the primary sense of the word; that of answering after listening is a secondary sense. At a time of such alarm to Christians a knock at the door in the dead of the night would carry terror with it, and careful listening to ascertain whether there was more than one person, and then to ask who was there and what was his business, was the natural course.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Joy for gladness, A.V.; that for how, A.V.

But the expression is obscure, and we do not know exactly the nature of the belief on which it was grounded. They must have thought that perhaps Peter had been put to death in prison that very night, and that his angel, speaking with his voice, was sent to announce it to the Church. The narrative is a striking instance how \"slow of heart to believe\" are even the most devout. They were praying very earnestly for Peter's life; their prayer was granted; and yet the announcement of it only draws out the answer, \"Thou art mad!\" and then, as an alternative, the explanation, \"It is his angel!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Opened for opened the door, A.V.; they... and for and... they, A.V.; amazed for astonished, A.V.

This, of course, is the same James as is mentioned in Galatians 1:19 as \"the Lord's brother,\" and who, in Galatians 2:9, 12, and Acts 15:12 and Acts 21:18, as well as here, appears as occupying a peculiar place in the Church at Jerusalem, viz. as all antiquity testifies, as Bishop of Jerusalem. So Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:23), \"James the Lord's brother, called by universal consent the Just, received the government of the Church together with the apostles;\" and in Acts 2:1 he quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that, after the Ascension, Peter, James, and John selected James the Just, the Lord's brother, to be the first Bishop of Jerusalem. And Eusebius gives it as the general testimony of antiquity that James the Just, the Lord's brother, was the first who sat on the episcopal throne of Jerusalem. But who he was exactly is a point much controverted. The three hypotheses are:NEWLINENEWLINE1. That he was the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary, sister to the blessed Virgin, and therefore our Lord's cousin german, and called his brother by a common Hebrew idiom. According to this theory he was one of the twelve (Luke 6:15), as he appears to be in Galatians 1:19, though this is not certain (see Bishop Lightfoot, in loc.).NEWLINENEWLINE2. That he was the son of Joseph by his first wife, and so stepbrother to the Lord, which is Eusebius's explanation ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:1).NEWLINENEWLINE3. That he was in the full sense the Lord's brother, being the son of Joseph and Mary. This is the opinion of Alford (in lee.), fully argued in the 'Proleg. to the Epistle of James,' and of Meyer, Credner, and many German commentators. According to these two last hypotheses, he was not one of the twelve. \"The apostolic constitutions distinguish between James the son of Alphaeus, the apostle, and James the brother of the Lord, ὁ ἐπίσκοπος (Meyer). It may be added that Acts 1:14 separates the brethren of the Lord from the apostles, who are enumerated in the preceding verses. The hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with James the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary is well argued in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. \"James\" (see also the able Introduction to the Epistle of James in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). It seems impossible to come to a certain conclusion. The weakest point in the hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with the son of Alphaeus is that it fails to account for the distinction clearly made between the Lord's brothers and the apostles in such passages as John 2:12; John 7:3, 5, 10; Acts 1:13; Matthew 12:46, 49; 1 Corinthians 9:5. For the effect of these passages is scarcely neutralized by Galatians 1:19. But then, on the other hand, the hypothesis that the Lord's brethren, including James and Joses, were the children of Joseph and Mary, seems to be flatly contradicted by the mention of Mary the wife of Clopas as being \"the mother of James and Jests\" (Mark 15:40; John 19:25). He went to another place. Whether Luke was not informed what the place was, or whether there was some reason why he did not mention it, we cannot tell. The Venerable Bode ('Prolog. in Expos. in Act. Apost.'), Baronius, and other authorities of the Church of Rome, say he went to Rome, and commenced his episcopate of Rome at this time Dr Lightfoot thinks it more probable that he went to Antioch (Comm. on Acts, in vol. 8. pp. 273, 289).

The blood of the martyr James was the seed of the Church, and the speedy vengeance taken by God upon the persecuter doubtless gave fresh courage to his people to confess the Name of Jesus Christ. As regards the preceding account of Herod Agrippa's death, it is corroborated in the most remarkable manner by the narrative in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 8:2). He there tells that when he had been three years King of all Judaea (see ver. 1, note) he went to Caesarea. And that on occasion of a festival celebrated \"for the safety of Caesar\" (some think to celebrate his return from Britain, while others, as Wieseler, think that they were the ordinary Quinquennalia, celebrated in the provinces), he exhibited games and spectacles in honor of Claudius. On the second day of these games, when a vast number of people were assembled in the theatre, Agrippa can? m, clothed in a garment wholly made of silver, which reflected the rays of the morning sun with a most dazzling and awful brilliancy. Whereupon his flatterers cried out that he was a god, and offered prayer to him. The king, he adds, did not rebuke them nor reject their impious flattery, he was presently seized with a violent pain in his bowels, which soon became so intense that he was carried out of the theatre to his palace, and expired after five days of excruciating pain. It is curious that in the above account Josephus says that Agrippa saw an owl sitting over his head, which he recognized as a messenger (ἄγγελον) of evil to him. Eusebius, quoting Josephus Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 10.), leaves out the owl, and says that Agrippa saw an angel sitting over his head, whom he recognized as the cause of his sufferings. Whiston, in a note, seeks to exonerate Eusebius from unfairness in the quotation by suggesting that the manuscript of Eusebius is in this place corrupt; but Bede quotes Josephus just as Eusebius does, unless perchance he is quoting him at second hand from Eusebius.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Ministration for ministry, A.V.; talking for and took, A.V. The fact here stated of their taking John Mark with them, is very interesting in connection with ver. 12. Whether or no Saul and Barnabas were in the house of Mary at the time of Peter's deliverance from prison, they evidently went there shortly before or shortly after. As regards the sequence of events related in this chapter, it is by no means necessary to suppose that Barnabas and Saul did not leave Jerusalem till after the death of Agrippa. Luke, connecting the death of Agrippa with his murder of James and his intended murder of Peter, as Eusebius and Chrysostom and others rightly say, would naturally follow up the narrative of the persecution by the narrative of the persecutor's awful death; and then go on to relate the return of the two apostles to Antioch in continuation of Acts 11:30. We have no means of deciding whether, in point of fact, they returned before or after Agrippa's death. It seems most probable that they returned before, as, under the circumstances, they would not tarry at Jerusalem longer than was necessary for the fulfillment of their ministration.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.13":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - At Antioch., in the Church that was there for in the Church that was at Antioch, A.V.; prophets, etc., for certain prophets, etc., A.V. and T.R.; Barnabas, etc., for as Barnabas, etc., A.V.; Symeon for Simeon, A.V.; the foster-brother of for which had been brought up with, A.V.

See also note on Acts 4:26). Teachers (διδάσκαλοι) are coupled with prophets, as here, in 1 Corinthians 12:28, 29; Ephesians 4:11. The teachers would appear to differ from the prophets in that they were not under the ecstatic influence of the Holy Spirit, and did not utter exhortations or prophecies in a poetic strain, but were expounders of Christian truth, under the teaching of the Spirit. What they spoke was called a διδαχή (1 Corinthians 14:26), and their function was διδασκαλία, as Romans 12:7, where διδασκαλία is reckoned among the χαρίσματα, the gifts of the Holy Ghost. It was forbidden to women to teach (διδάσκειν: 1 Timothy 2:12), though they might prophesy (Acts 21:9). It is thought by Meyer, Alford, and others that the position of the particles τε attaching the two following names to Barnabas in the first place, and one name following to Manaen in the second, indicates that Barnabas, Symeon, and Lucius were prophets, and Manaen and Saul teachers. Lucius has by some been falsely identified with St. Luke. The foster-brother; σύντροφος may equally mean a foster-brother, one nursed at the same time at the same breast, which would indicate that Manaen's mother was wet-nurse to Herod the tetrarch; or a playmate, which would indicate that he had been sodalis to Herod. It is only found here in the New Testament, but is used by Xenophon, Plutarch, etc., and in 1 Macc. 1:7; 2 Macc. 9:29. In this chapter and onwards the scene of the great drama of Christianity is transferred from Jerusalem to Antioch. The first part, which has hitherto been played by Peter and John and James, is now taken up by Barnabas and Saul, soon, however, to be classed as Paul and Barnabas.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And as for as, A.V. They ministered; i.e. not, as Meyer explains it, the whole Church, but the prophets and teachers, doubtless at an assembly of the Church. The word λειτουργούντων, here rendered \"they ministered\" (from which the word \"Liturgy\" is derived), signifies any solemn ministration or holy service. In the Old Testament the LXX. use it as the rendering of שֵׁרֵת, to minister (often with the addition \"to God,\" or \"to the Lord \"), which is a general word applying to the ministrations of priests and Levites (Exodus 28:35; Numbers 8:26, etc.). Hence its use in Hebrews 10:11 (see too Luke 1:23; Hebrews 9:21). Joshua too is called Moses'minister (מְשָׁרֵת) in Joshua 1:1, etc., and the angels are called λριτουργικὰ πνεύματα, \"ministering spirits\" (Hebrews 1:14). Just as the Church transferred from the Jewish congregation so many other words and things, so also the use of the words λειτουργία λειτουργεῖν, to Sicily \"Divine service,\" without specifying the particular office, whether prayer, or preaching, or Holy Communion, or ordination, or any ether part of the worship of God. Its classical use was to designate any office performed by an individual for the public good. Hence in the New Testament its application to Church alms (2 Corinthians 9:12), to gifts for the support of the ministry (Philippians 2:30), to the office of magistrates (Romans 13:6), etc. The restricted application of the term λειτουργία to the service used in the celebration of the Eucharist was of much later growth, as is evident from Chrysostom explaining the word here of preaching. \"What means ministering? Preaching\" (Hom. 27.). It seems to have arisen from the fact that the first forms of prayer were those come posed for the office of the Holy Communion. This passage, therefore, does not give the slightest support to fasting Communion. What was the exact occasion of the service and fast here spoken of it is impossible to say. The Holy Ghost said, etc. This is the origin of the question in the Ordination of Deacons, \"Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office?\" Separate me (ἀφορίσατε). The act of separation, or ordination, would be by the laying on of the hands of Symeon and Lucius and Manaen, as Chrysostom says (at least of the two last named), in the presence of the whole Church, but the separation by the Holy Ghost, at least as regards Saul (ὁ ἀφορίσας με), bad been from his mother's womb (Galatians 1:15). Observe, too, the καλέσας of Galatians 1:15, and the προσκέκλημαι here. This is another instance of the very close resemblance between parts of the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians, which looks as if St. Paul was writing it about the same time as he was giving to St. Luke the details of his own history (see Acts 8:19, note). The ordination was to the apostolate (Chrysostom). Barnabas and Saul are never called apostles till after their ordination or consecration (Acts 14:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Then for and, A.V. It does not follow that the laying on of hands was on the same day. On the contrary, the mention of the fasting again in this verse makes it impossible so to understand it. Doubtless, on receiving this intimation of the Spirit, they fixed a day for the ordination, and prepared for it by fasting and prayer. The ember days of the Church before ordinations are m accordance with this precedent of Holy Scripture. With this departure of Barnabas and Saul commences the second and main part of the Acts of the apostles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Went down to for departed unto, A.V. (κατῆλθον). Seleucia was the sea-port of Antioch, about sixteen miles from it, and five miles north of the mouth of the Orontes. It was a free city by a grant from Pompey. It is now in ruins, but \"the masonry of the once magnificent port of Seleucia is in so good a state that\" it might be repaired and cleared out \"for about £31,000\" (Colonel Chesney, quoted in Lewin, 1. p. 119). They sailed to Cyprus. Barnabas, no doubt, took the lead, and was naturally drawn to his native island of Cyprus - within a hundred miles of Seleucia, and, on a clear day, visible from it. The number of Jews in the island, and the partial evangelization of it which had already taken place (Acts 11:19, 20), and which promised them assistance and support, no doubt further influenced them. John Mark went with them, as we learn from the fifth and thirteenth verses, and possibly other brethren as deacons and ministers (see next note). They sailed straight to Salamis, \"a convenient and capacious harbor,\" in the center of the eastern end of the island, and the principal or one of the principal towns. It had a large population of Jews. It was destroyed in the reign of Trajan, in consequence of a terrible insurrection of the Jews, in which they massacred 240,000 of the Gentile population. No Jew was ever after allowed to land in Cyprus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Proclaimed for preached, A.V.; as their attendant for to their minister, A.V. (ὑπηρέτην). It is a word taken from the synagogue, where it denotes an inferior minister (see Luke 4:20). In Acts 5:22 the ὑπηρέται are the apparitors of the high priest. Here it is synonymous with διάκονος, a deacon. John was to Barnabas and Saul what Joshua was to Moses, Elisha to Elijah, etc. Peter, when he went to Caesarea, was accompanied by six brethren (Acts 11:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The whole island for the isle, A.V. and T.R. Paphos; on the south coast at the further extremity of the island, now Baffa. It had once a convenient harbor, which is now choked up from neglect. The chief temple of the Cyprian Venus was here. A certain sorcerer. The Greek word μάγος, whence magic and magician, is the same as in Matthew 2:1 is rendered \"wise men.\" But here, as in Acts 8:9, it has a bad sense. It is a Persian word, and in its original use designated a Persian religious caste, famous for their knowledge, wisdom, and purity of religious faith. They were attached to the court of the Babylonian monarchs, and were deemed to have great skill in astrology, in interpretation of dreams, and the like (see Daniel 1:20; Daniel 4:7; Daniel 4 in the LXX.). In Jeremiah 39:3, 13, the name Rab-mag seems to mean \"the chief of the magi.\" But in process of time the word \"magus\" came to mean a sorcerer, a magician, a practicer of dark arts, as e.g. Simon Magus (see the chapter on magic in Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,'lib. 30. cap. 1.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The proconsul for the deputy of the country, A.V.; a man of understanding for a prudent man, A.V.; the same for who, A.V.; unto him for for, A.V.; sought for desired, A.V. The proconsul (ἀνθύπατος); here and vers. 8, 12. This is an instance of Luke's great accuracy. Cyprus had become a proconsular province in the reign of Claudius, having previously been one of the emperor's provinces governed by a propraetor, or legatus. A man of understanding (ἀνδρὶ συνετῷ). Συνετός is a rare word in the New Testament, and is always translated in the A.V. \"prudent\" (see Matthew 11:25; Luke 10:21; 1 Corinthians 1:19). It is common in the LXX., where it represents the Hebrew words מַשְׂכִּיל נָבון מֵבִין, and חָכָם, all signifying \"intelligence,\" \"skill,\" \"knowledge,\" and the like. The substantive σύνεσις has the same scope (see Luke 2:47; Ephesians 3:4; Colossians 1:9, etc.); ἀνὴρ συνετός, therefore, means something more than \"a prudent man.\" It means a man of knowledge and superior intelligence and understanding. And such was Sergius Paulus, a noble Roman, who is twice named by Pliny in the list of authors placed at the commencement of his work as the authorities from whom he derived the matter contained in the several books. It is not a little remarkable that the two books, lib. it. and lib. 18, for which Sergius Paulus is quoted are just those which contain accounts of the heavenly bodies, and prognostications from the sun and moon and stars, from thunder, from the clouds, and such like things, which doubtless formed the staple of Elymas's science; so that there can be little doubt that Sergius Paulus had Elymas with him, that he might learn from him such matters as might be useful for the hook which he was writing. There is also a curious passage in lib. 30. cap. 1. of the 'Hist. Nat.'(quoted by Lewin, vol. 1. p. 128), in which Pliny, after enumerating the most famous teachers of magic, Zoroaster, Orthanes, Pythagoras, and others, adds, \"There is also another school of magic which springs from Moses and Jannes, who were Jews, but many thousand years later than Zoroaster; so much more recent is the school of Cyprus;\" showing that he knew of a school of magic art at Cyprus taught by Jews, and leading us to infer that he had acquired this knowledge either from the pen or the mouth of Sergius Paulus. Anyhow, a remarkable confirmation of St. Luke's narrative. Another Sergius Paulus, who might be a son or grandson of the proconsul, is highly commended by Galen for his eminent philosophical attainments (Lewin, vol. 1. p. 127). One L. Sergius Paulus was consul suffectus in A.D. , another in A.D. . Renan thinks they may have been descendants of the Sergius Paulus in the text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Turn aside for turn away, A.V.; proconsul for deputy, A.V. Elymas, from the Arabic elite, plural oulema, a wise man, a wizard, a magician. But Renan thinks this derivation doubtful. Elymas withstood Barnabas and Saul just as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses (2 Timothy 3:8, ἀντέστησαν).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But for then, A.V.; is also for also is, A.V.; fastened for set, A.V. (above, Acts ill 4, note). Who is also called Paul. The explanation of Jerome, Augustine, Bede, and many modern commentators, as Meyer, Olshausen, etc., and not rejected by Renan, is that Saul took the name of Paul on the occasion of this remarkable and important conversion of Sergius Paulus. Saul's future intercourse with Gentiles made it desirable that, after the common custom of the Jews of his day - as seen in Peter, Stephen, Mark, Lucius, Jason, Crispus, Justus, Niger, Aquila, Priscilla, Drusilla etc. - he should have a Gentile name, and so, in honor of his illustrious convert, or in memory of his conversion, or at the special request of Sergius Paulus (Baronius), he took the name of Paul, which in sound was not unlike his Hebrew name. The fact of this change of name being recorded by St. Luke at this precise moment makes this the most simple and natural explanation. Compare Gideon's change of name to Jerubbaal (Judges 6:32; Judges 7:1; Judges 8:29, 35). Alford, on the ether hand, thinks it strange that any one should make such a mistake as Jerome's, and says that \"this notice marks the transition from the former part of his history\" - \"gathered from the narratives of others\" - to \"the joint memoirs of himself and St. Paul.\" But this gives no account of the coincidence of the two Pauls, nor is it true that the latter half of the Acts begins here. It began at ver. 1, and the name of Saul has been retained three times in the early part of this chapter. Farrar speaks of this explanation as, long and deservedly abandoned,\" and as having in it an element of vulgarity. Howson thinks that Paul had long been his Roman name, but that the conversion of Sergius Paulus, as it were, stereotyped the Roman name as that by which the apostle was henceforth to be known. The idea of Augustine and others, that he took the name of Paul (paulus, small) from humility, to indicate that he was \"the least\" of the apostles, is fanciful. Neither is Chrysostom's assertion, that he changed his name at his ordination or consecration, borne out by the facts. Renan ('Saint Paul,' 1:19) notes that \"Paul\" was a very common name in Cilicia. No certainty can be arrived at in the matter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All guile and all villainy for all subtlety and all mischief, A.V.; son for child, A.V. The word ῤᾳδιουργία, reckless conduct, villainy, wickedness, is only found here in the New Testament. The kindred form (ῤᾳδιούργημα) occurs in Acts 18:14. Thou son of the devil (comp. John 8:38, 44; 1 John 3:10). Elymas showed himself a child of the devil in his endeavors to resist the truth of the gospel, and substitute his own falsehoods and imposture. Compare the severity of Peter's language in rebuking Simon Magas (Acts 8:20-23). Probably, too, he accused (διέβαλεν) Paul and Barnabas, and traduced their motives before the proconsul, when he saw his own influence being undermined, and his gains likely to be stopped.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Is upon thee; or rather, against thee (Matthew 10:21; Matthew 26:55; Luke 11:17; and ver. 50 of this chapter). For a season. It has been well observed that this limitation in time is an indication that there was place for repentance. It was a remedial chastisement. A mist (ἀχλύς); only here in the New Testament; but it is a medical term, very common in Hippocrates, to express a darkening and dimming of the eyes by cataract or other disease. As regards the reason why the particular punishment of blindness was inflicted upon Elymas, it might be to put a forcible interruption upon those observations of the stars and clouds by which the magician pretended to foresee the future. It would exhibit, too, to Sergius, Paulus the utter helplessness of the great necromancer. Some to lead him by the hand (χειραγωγούς), as Saul had needed χειραγωγοῦντας when he was struck blind by the vision of the Savior's glory (Acts 9:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The proconsul for the deputy, A.V.; teaching for doctrine, A.V. Believed. We cannot, perhaps, conclude positively from this that Sergius was baptized and became an avowed Christian, though the usual language of the Acts rather leads us to infer it (see ver. 48; Acts 2:44; Acts 4:4; Acts 8:12, 13; Acts 11:21; Acts 19:18). Farrar thinks that if so marked a person had become a lifelong convert, we should have heard of him as such in other writings, Renan says, \"La conversion d'un Romain de cet ordre, a cette epoque est chose absolument inadmissible.\" Alford and Olshausen speak doubtfully. Lange and Howson and Meyer look upon him as a genuine convert. The 'Speaker's Commentary' speaks of him as \"the first fruits of heathenism.\" Being astonished at the teaching. \"For the connection of the judgment concerning the doctrine with the miracle seen, comp. Mark 1:27\" (Meyer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Vow for now when, A.V.; set sail for loosed, A.V.; and came for they came, A.V.; departed.., and returned for departing... returned, A.V. A very marked change may here be observed in the relations of Barnabas and Paul. Hitherto Barnabas has always occupied the first rank. It has been \"Barnabas and Saul\" (Acts 11:30; Acts 12:25; vers. 2, 7). But now the whole mission, including Barnabas, is described as οἱ περὶ τὸν Παῦλον, Paul and his company, and ever after it is usually \"Paul and Barnabas\" (vers. 43, 46, 50; Acts 15:2, 22, 35); though in Acts 14:14 and Acts 15:12, 25, the old order is retained. Renan dwells much on the beauty of Barnabas's character as seen in his cheerful acquiescence in this change of relative position, and his single-minded devotion to the success of the work. Came to Perga, the capital of Pamphylia, in that part of the coast of Asia Minor which looks due south. Perga was about seven and a half miles inland, on the river Cestrus, which is navigable. There was a constant intercourse between Paphos the capital of Cyprus, and Perga the capital of Pamphylia, fostered probably by the two famous temples of Venus and Diana. The word for set sail (ἀναχθέντες) is a nautical term, meaning sailing from the shore or harbor into the open sea (see Acts 16:11; Acts 21:1; Acts 27:12; Luke 8:22). At Perga John Mark left them. Perhaps his position as Barnabas's cousin was less pleasant now that Paul took the first place; perhaps his courage failed him now that they were fairly launched out into the heathen world, where, unlike Cyprus, his Jewish kinsmen were a small minority, and the dangers and fatigues were great. Pamphylia was now governed by a propraetor, being an imperial province. Its name denotes that it was inhabited by a mixed race - men of all tribes, aborigines, Cilicians, Greeks, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - They, passing through from Perga, came for when they departed from Perga they came, A.V.; of for in, A.V.; they went for went, A.V. Traveling due north into the interior for over a hundred miles, they would reach Antioch in Pisidia, now a Roman colony. It would be a difficult and dangerous road, infested with robbers (2 Corinthians 11:26), mountainous, rugged, and passing through an untamed and half-savage population. Pisidia was part of the province of Galatia. The direction of their route was probably determined by the locality of the Jewish populations, which were always their first object, and their door of access to the more pious heathen. Sat down; perhaps, as many think, on the seat of the rabbis - those \"chief seats in the synagogues,\" which our Lord rebukes the scribes for loving (Mark 12:39), but which \"Paul as a former Sanhe-drist, and Barnabas as a Levite,\" had a fair claim to occupy; but more probably on the seats of ordinary worshippers, where, however, the presence of strangers would at once be noticed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Brethren for ye men and brethren, A.V. The order of the synagogue service was first the prayers, read by the Sheliach, or angel of the synagogue, the people standing. Then came the reading of the Law in Hebrew by the reader, and the interpretation by the interpreter, who, outside of Judaea, generally used the version of the LXX. This reading, or lesson, was called the Parashah. Next came the reading and interpreting of the prophets, called the Haphtorah, either by the regular reader or by any one invited by the ruler of the synagogue (Luke 4:16, 17). Then came the Midrash, the exposition or sermon, which Paul undertook at the invitation of the ruler of the synagogue. Our Lord at Nazareth seems to have delivered the Midrash sitting (Luke 4:20); here St. Paul stands (ver. 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And for then, A.V.; the for Ms, A.V.; hearken for give audience, A.V.

The word ὕψωσεν, exalted, is thought by some to be borrowed from the LXX. of Isaiah 1:2 (רוןממְתִי), I have brought up\" (A.V.), but this is very doubtful, as ὑψόω is frequently used in the New Testament in the sense of exalting from a low to a high estate (see Matthew 11:23; Matthew 23:12; Luke 1:52; Luke 10:15; Luke 14:11; Acts 2:33; see too Genesis 41:52 (LXX., Cod. Vat.) and Gen 48:19). The resemblance of this exordium to that of Stephen's speech in Acts 7. must strike every one. The natural conclusion is that that speech made a deep impression upon St. Paul when he heard it at Stephen's trial. The common purpose in the two speeches is to conciliate and gain the attention of the Jewish hearers by dwelling upon the great events of the history of their fathers, of which they were proud, and claiming for Christians an equal heritage in that history. The speeches diverge in that Stephen sought to show in that history instances of the same stubborn unbelief in their fathers which had led the children to crucify the Lord of glory; but St. Paul rather sought to show how the promises made to their fathers had their fulfillment in that Jesus whom he preached unto them, and how the crucifixion of Christ by the Jerusalem Jews was an exact fulfillment of the Law and the prophets which had just been read to them in the synagogue. In both speeches it is a great point to exhibit Christianity as the true development of Judaism (comp. Hebrews 1:1 and throughout).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - For about for about, A.V. Suffered he their manners (ἐτροποφόρησεν). This word τροποφορέω, to bear or put up with any one's (perverse) manners, is found nowhere else in the New Testament. But in the Cod. Alex. of the LXX. it is the rendering of Deuteronomy 1:31, instead of ἐτροφόρησεν he bare or carried, as a nursing father carries his child, which is the read of the Cod. Vat. and of the margin of the R.T. here. The Hebrew נָשָׂא is capable of either sense. From this quotation from Deuteronomy it is conjectured that the Par-ashah on this occasion was from Deuteronomy 1, and if the ὕψωσεν of ver. 17 is taken from Isaiah 1, that would seem to have been the Haphtorah, and it is curious that Deuteronomy 1. and Isaiah 1. are read in the synagogues now on the same sabbath (but see note on ver. 17). Forty years is invariably the time assigned to the dwelling in the wilderness (Exodus 16:35; Numbers 14:33, 34; Numbers 32:13; Numbers 33:38; Deuteronomy 1:3; Psalm 95:10, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - Canaan for Chanaan, A.V.; he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years: and after these things he gave them judges, etc., for he divided their land unto them by lot: and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, etc., A.V. and T.R. It is difficult to say what is the meaning of the R.T. in regard to the four hundred and fifty years, what is the terminus a quo or ad quem intended by it. The usual explanations of the reading of the R.T. (adopted by Lachman, Bishop Wordsworth, and others) is that the years are dated from the birth of Isaac, and that the meaning is that the promise to give the land to the seed of Abraham was actually performed within four hundred and fifty years (ὡς ἔτεσι) (after the analogy of Galatians 3:17), which gives a good sense and is not at all improbable (see Bishop Wordsworth's note). The reading of the T.R. has grave objections on the score of chronology as well as grammar. Duration of time is expressed by the accusative case, as vers. 18 and 21; the measure of time in which a thing is done by the dative. So that the natural rendering of the T.R. would be that he gave them judges four hundred and fifty years after the entrance into Canaan; which of course cannot be the meaning. The other objection is that, if the times of the judges from the final conquest of the land to the judgeship of Samuel was four hundred and fifty years, the whole time from the Exodus to the building of the temple must have been about six hundred and forty years (37 from death of Moses to Othuiel + 450, + 30 for judgeship of Samuel, + 40 of Saul's reign, + 40 for David's reign, +3 years of Solomon, + and the 40 years in the wilderness), whereas 1 Kings 6:1 gives the time as four hundred and eighty years; while the genealogies suppose a much shorter time - about two hundred and eighty years. It is an immense gain, therefore, to get rid of this four hundred and fifty years for the time of the judges, and by the well-supported reading of the R.T. to get a calculation in agreement with Galatians 3:17 and with the chronology of the times. Gave them... for an inheritance. The T.R. has κατεκληροδότησεν, the R.T. has κατεκληρονόμησεν, which words are not infrequently interchanged in different codices of the LXX. (see Joshua 19:51; Deuteronomy 1:38; Deuteronomy 21:16, etc.). They have nearly identical meanings, \"to give as an inheritance by lot.\" Neither word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Asked for for desired, A.V.; Kish for Cis, A.V.; for for by, A.V. The forty years assigned to Saul may very probably include the seven years and six months (2 Samuel 5:5) which elapsed before David's kingdom was established over all Israel, while the house of Saul was still in power. The first twenty or thirty years of his reign after the rescue of Jabesh-gilead are passed over in absolute silence. The narrative from 1 Samuel 13. to 31. relates only to about the last ten years of his life (for the correction of the A.V. of 1 Samuel 13:1, see 'Speaker's Commentary').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Raised up for raised up unto them, A.V. and T.R.; bare witness for gave testimony, A.V.; my for mine own, A.V.; do for fulfill, A.V.; who for which, A.V.

This verse leads to the great announcement which Paul had to make of the next great step in God's dealings with Israel, for which the pro- ceding ones of the redemption from Egyptian bondage, and the kingdom of David, were preparatory, viz. the actual coming of the Son of David, the Messiah, to save his people Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - His coming (τῆς εἰσόδου); his entrance upon his ministry, with reference to the ὁδὸς (the way) of Isaiah 40:3 and Malachi 3:1 (for the use of dadoes, see 1 Thessalonians 1:9; 2 Thessalonians 2:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am?

St. Paul, as reported by Luke, follows very closely the narrative in Luke 3:3, etc. Compare the words Προκηρύξαντος Ἰωάννου... βάπτισμα μετανοίας with Luke 3:3, Κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας. Compare Πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου with Τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, Luke 3:4. Compare Παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραήλ with the mention in Luke 3:9, 10, of the multitudes of the people, and the enumeration of the different classes of people. Com- pare the question, \"Whom [or, 'what'] think ye that I am?\" with the statement in Luke 3:15, that all men were musing in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not. Compare the construction of the phrase, Ἔρχεται μετ ἐμὲ οϋ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἄξιος τὸ, ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν λῦσαι with Luke 3:16; and in ver. 26 compare the Υἱοὶ γένους Ἀβραὰμ with the Πατέρα ἔχομεν τὸν Ἀβραάμ, and the Τέκνα τῷ Ἀβραάμ of Luke 3:8. There is also a strong resemblance to John 1:19-28. St. Paul fortifies his own witness to Jesus as the Christ by that of John the Baptist, probably from knowing that many of his hearers believed that John was a prophet (see Luke 20:6; Matthew 21:26; comp. Peter's address, Acts 10:37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Brethren for men and brethren, A.V., as ver. 15; those among you that fear for whosoever among you feareth, A.V.; to us for to you, A.V. and T.R.; sent forth for sent, A.V. and T.R.

Meyer (following Chrysostom), Alford, and others, make it mark the contrast between the Jews addressed by Paul and the Jews at Jerusalem. \"This salvation is sent forth to you [according to Bengel, 'from Jerusalem,' according to others, 'from God'], for the Jerusalem Jews have rejected Christ. And in consequence of their rejection, you, who had no share in crucifying the Lord of glory, are invited to take their place. But it maybe taken as expressing the cause why this salvation is complete and capable of being offered to them. This salvation is preached to you because, through the instrumentality of those that dwell at Jerusalem, all that was written in the Scriptures concerning Christ has been fulfilled. Christ has been crucified and raised from the dead, and so now remission of sins is proclaimed to you through him (vers. 38, 39; comp. Acts 3:13-20). Which are read every sabbath.

The words καθελόντες and ἔθηκαν εἰς μνημεῖον are the same as Luke 23:53, 55 (μνῆμα and μνημεῖον being interchanged).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut God raised him from the dead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For many days for many days, A.V.; that for which, A.V.; who are now for who are, A.V. and T.R. St. Paul thus confirms the statement in Acts 1:3 (see note to Acts 1:11). From Galilee to Jerusalem. Who are meant? and what ascent from Galilee to Jerusalem is here intended? The answer to the first question is, the eleven apostles, whose special office it was to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (Acts 1:22, note). The answer to the second is, that the ascent from Galilee, where most of our Lord's appearances took place, to Jerusalem, shortly before the Ascension, is here intended, and that this passage is a distinct recognition by St. Luke of the Galilaean appearances. There is, as is well known, great obscurity, and apparent discrepancies in the accounts of our Lord's appearances after the Resurrection. St. Matthew seems to place them exclusively in Galilee (Matthew 28:7, 10, 16). St. Mark likewise (16: 7); but in the section 9-20 he mentions the appearance to Mary Magdalene and to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, but gives no clue as to where the appearance to the eleven took place. St. Luke seems to place them exclusively in Judaea, but very curiously puts a mention of Galilee in the angel's mouth in the very place where, according to St. Matthew, he announced the Lord's appearance in Galilee. St. John, again places the three first appearances in Jerusalem (John 20.), but describes at length a third as having taken place in Galilee (John 21:2, 14). St. Paul (1 Corinthians 15:6) speaks of an appearance to five hundred brethren at once, which in all probability took place in Galilee, as only a hundred and twenty names were numbered at Jerusalem (Acts 1:15). It is, therefore, satisfactory to have this confirmation of the residence of the apostles in Galilee between the Resurrection and the Ascension in St. Luke's report of St. Paul's speech. Observe that St. Paul distinctly separates himself from these witnesses by the emphatic ἡμεῖς in ver. 32.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Bring you good tidings of the promise made for declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - How that God for God, A.V. (\"how that\" being in ver. 32); our children for us their children, A.V. and T.R.; raised up for hath raised up... again, A.V.; as also it is for as it is also, A.V. Our children. The reading of the R.T. is not adopted by Meyer or Alford, and is scarcely an improvement upon the T.R. There can be no reasonable doubt that ἀναστήσας, raised up, means here, as in ver. 44, raised from the dead. Observe with what skill the apostle speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to their fathers, which it was to be presumed they were anxiously expecting. The second psalm. Many manuscripts and editions have, \"the first,\" because the first psalm was often reckoned not numerically but as an introduction to the whole book, so that the second psalm was numbered as the first. This is probably the reason why the eighteen psalms as reckoned by the Jews include Psalm 19, though Joshua ben Levi explains it by the rejection of the second psalm, on account, no doubt, of its testimony to Messiah as God's begotten Son. But the rabbins generally acknowledge the application of this psalm to Messiah (Lightfoot, 'Exercit. on the Acts'). Thou art my Son, etc. This application of the second psalm to the Resurrection is best explained by Romans 1:4. The reference in both passages to David is remarkable (vers. 22, 23). Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all worlds, was declared before men and angels to be the Son of God, when he was raised from the dead in the power of an endless life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Hath spoken for said, A.V.; holy and sure blessings for sure mercies, A.V. No more to return to corruption. This is added to show that Christ's resurrection was a final victory over death; not like that of Lazarus, or the Shunammite's son, or Jairus's daughter, but, as St. Paul himself says (Romans 6:9), \"Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.\" Here he tells us that this eternal exemption of Christ from death was promised or signified in Isaiah 55:3, which he quotes from the LXX., only abbreviating the διαθήσομαι κ.τ.λ., into δώσω, I will give. What, then, is meant by the ὅσια Δαβὶδ τὰ πιστά? The Hebrew has חֻסְדֵי דָוְד הַנֶּךאמָנִים, which can mean nothing else but \"the sure mercies of David,\" the favor and mercy promised to David in God's everlasting covenant, well ordered in all things and sure. And in like manner, in 2 Chronicles 6:42, ὅσια Δαβὶδ means \"the mercies of God to David.\" And if we turn to the account of this covenanted mercy in 2 Samuel 7, we shall see that it comprises the setting of David's seed upon his throne for ever (see specially vers. 12-16). In ver. 15 it is said, חַסְדִי לאִ יָסוּר מִמֶּגוּ, \"My mercy shall not depart from him.\" And in the next verse his house and his kingdom are described as being נֶאְמַן לְעֹלָם, sure,\" or \"established for ever,\" which, when applied to the personal Christ, the Son of David, manifestly implies his eternal exemption from death and corruption (see also Psalm 132:4). The sense of the Hebrew, therefore, is clever and certain, and it is equally certain that the LXX. meant to represent this sense in the version here quoted by St. Paul. Ὅσιος, though properly meaning \"holy, pious,\" and thence \"mild\" and \"merciful\" (εἰρηνικὸς, Hesych.) as applied to man, came to be applied in the same senses to God (Revelation 15:4; Revelation 16:5; and here and in the LXX.). Beyond doubt, therefore, the passage before us is rightly rendered in the A.V., \"the sure mercies of David;\" the plural, ὅσια, represents the חֲסָדִים of the Hebrew. Clemens Alex. (quoted by Schleusner) uses it in the same way for \"mercies or \"benefits:\" Πόσα αὐτῷ ὀφείλομεν ὅσια: \"For how many mercies are we indebted to Christ!\" In a similar way, the Latin pietas is used for God's \"justice\" or \"kindness\" ('AEneid,' 2:536; 5:688). \"Trini pulses pietatem\" (on a sepulchral monument, A.D. 1427): \"Beat at the door of God's mercy.\" Gronovius, in his note on 'AEian. V. H.,' 8:1, where he ascribes to ὅσιος the primitive sense of what is \"just\" and \"due,\" from man either to God or to his fellowman, adds, \"Tribuunt quidem LXX? interpetiam Deo τὸ ὅσιον: sod etiam tum significat quoddam quasi offcium benignitatia in heroines pios, Deo decorum.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Because for wherefore, A.V. and T.R.; thou wilt not give for thou shalt not suffer, A.V. (see Acts 2:27, note); thy for thine, A.V. It is remarkable that St. Peter and St. Paul should both quote this sixteenth psalm, and use precisely the same argument.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - In his own generation served the counsel of God for served his own generation by the will of God, A.V. Many good commentators construe the words as the R.T. does, only some, instead of in his own generation, render \"for,\" i.e. for the good of, \"his own generation.\" But the A.V. is the most natural division of the sentence, and gives the best sense, only the punctuation should connect the words \"by the will of God\" with \"fell on sleep.\" There is an allusion to 2 Samuel 7:12 and 1 Kings 2:l, 10, and it is intimated that God was still caring for David in his death. But there was this vast difference between David and Christ. David had a work to do limited to his own generation, and when that work was done he died and saw corruption. But Christ had a work to carry on for eternal generations, and so he rose and saw no corruption.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Raised up for raised again, A.V., Ἤγειρεν, \"raised from the death of sleep, as Acts 5:30; 1 Corinthians 15:42-44; 2 Corinthians 4:14; Ephesians 5:14, etc. The two words (ἀνίστημι and ἐγείρω) are combined in Acts 12:7. Ἐγείρω is \"to arouse,\" or \"awaken;\" ἀνίστημι, to \"make to get up.\" Or in the passive ἐγείρομαι to be \"awakened,\" and in the neuter, ἀνέστην, to get.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Brethren for men and brethren, A.V., as before, vers. 26 and 15; proclaimed for preached, A.V.; remission for the forgiveness, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Every one that believeth is for all that believe are, A.V. Here, then, is the great gospel message of grace, \"the gospel of the grace of God,\" as St. Paul speaks in Acts 20:24; the proclamation, consequent upon the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, of a free and full forgiveness of sins to all that repent and believe the gospel (Acts 20:21); see Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19; Acts 4:12; Acts 5:31; Colossians 1:14, etc., and Matthew 1:21; Luke 1:77. Note, too, how adroitly the apostle points out the superiority of the gospel which he was preaching to them over the Law, and the pre-eminence of Christ over Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Spoken for spoken of, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - If one for though a man, A.V. \"Though\" best expresses the ἐὰν and the כּי of the Hebrew. The passage is quoted nearly verbatim from the LXX. of Hebrews 1:5. The difference from the Hebrew arises from the LXX. having read in their copy בֹּגדְיִם, proud, arrogant men (καταφρονητάι), for בַגּוים, among the heathen, as is clear from their rendering the Hebrew בוגֵד, in Habakkuk 1:13 and Habakkuk 2:5, by the same word (καταφρονοῦντας and καταφρονητής). The rendering καὶ ἀφανίσθητε, and perish, for the Hebrew תְּמָהוּ (another form of the preceding verb הִתַּמְהוּ, which in the A.V. is construed with it, and the two together rendered \"wonder marvelously\"), is not so easily explained. The two best explanations seem to beNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the LXX. read תְּמָהוּ וְהתַּמְהוּ instead of the present order of the words, and so rendered the first word θαυμάσατε, wonder, and, taking the next word from another root, תָמַם, rendered it ἀφανίσθητε, perish;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) that, reading the words in the same order in which they now stand in the Hebrew text, they rendered the first θαυμάσατε, or, with the intensive addition, θαυμασίᾳ, and took the second in the sense it has in Arabic, \"to be altered\" or \"changed for the worse,\" and expressed it by ἀφανίσθητε, meaning\" change countenance from fear and astonishment.\" And in favor of this explanation the use of ἀφανίζουσι τὰ πρόσωπα in Matthew 6:16 (\"they disfigure their faces\") is quoted (see Rosenmüller on Habakkuk 1:5). St. Paul took the LXX. as he found it. Perhaps he saw signs in some of that unbelief and perverse opposition which afterwards broke out (ver. 45), and so was led to close his sermon with words of awful warning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - And as they went out for when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, A.V. and T.R.; they for the Gentiles, A.V. and T.R.; spoken for preached, A.V. They besought. The R.T. is that of Chrysostom and the best manuscripts, and is adopted by Meyer, Olshausen, Lange, Afford, Bishop Wordsworth, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc. There is a difference of opinion as to who is meant by they. The simplest explanation is that they means Paul and Barnabas, who went out of the synagogue before the formal dismissal of the congregation; and, as they were going out, received an invitation to repeat their instruction on the next sabbath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - The synagogue broke up for the congregation was broken up, A.V.; the devout for religious, A.V.; urged for persuaded, A.V. This verse manifestly describes something subsequent to the event recorded in the preceding. The congregation had asked Paul and Barnabas, perhaps through the ruler of the synagogue, to return next sabbath. But when the congregation broke up, many Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas to their own house and received further instructions and exhortation to continue in the grace of God. No doubt Barnabas had his full share in this more private ministry of exhortation (Acts 4:36, note, and Acts 11:23). (For the meaning of \"to continue in the grace of God,\" see Galatians 5:4.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Sabbath for sabbath day, A.V.; almost the whole city was gathered for came almost the whole city, A.V.

Jealousy. Neither word exactly expresses the ζῆλος. The indignation of ver. 17, A.V. (where see note), is nearer the sense; though jealousy of the influence of the two strangers may have entered into the fierce passion which was stirred up in the Jewish mind, as well as jealousy for their own religion, which they saw was being superseded by the doctrine of Paul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - And for then, A.V. and T.R.; spake out boldly for waxed bold, A.V.; be for have been, A.V.; seeing for but seeing, A.V. and T.R.; thrust for put, A.V.; eternal for everlasting, A.V. Spake out boldly. Observe that Barnabas as well as Paul resented the unseemly opposition of the Jews. It was necessary. The necessity arose from the command of Christ (Luke 24:47; Acts 1:8; Acts 3:26). It is in accordance with this purpose of God that St. Paul says of the gospel that \"it is the power of God unto salvation... to the Jew first, and also to the Greek\" (Romans 1:16). Compare, too, our Lord's saying (Matthew 15:24) and the woman's reply (ibid. 27). In point of fact, this had been the practice of Paul and Barnabas no less than of Peter, and was the very motive that had brought them to Antioch. Lo, we turn to the Gentiles. These were, indeed, bold words to speak in a Jewish synagogue; the speakers had doubtless sought courage from the Holy Ghost (see Acts 4:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - For a light for to be a light, A.V.; the uttermost part for the ends, A.V. The quotation is from the LXX. (Cod. Alex.) of Isaiah 49:6. Compare the frequent quotations by St. Paul from Isaiah in Romans 15. The additional words which appear in the LXX., εἰς διαθήκην γένους, have no counterpart in the Hebrew, and are probably corrupt. The application of the passage is, God declared his purpose by Isaiah, that his Servant Messiah should be the Light and Salvation of the Gentiles, and we are commissioned to give effect to that purpose by our preaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - As for when, A.V.; God for the Lord, A.V. and T.R. As many as were ordained to eternal life believed. This can only refer to the predestination or election of God, viewed as the moving cause of their faith (comp. Ephesians 1:4, 5, 11, 12; Philippians 1:6; 2 Timothy 2:9; 1 Peter 1:2.

The devout women of honorable estate: εὐσχήμων is, literally, well-formed; then decent, becoming; and then honorable, well-to-do (comb. Acts 17:4, γυναικῶν τῶν πρώτων). See Mark 15:43, where Joseph of Arimathaea is described as εὐσχήμων βουλευτής, \"an honorable counselor.\" The devout women (αι} σεβόμεναι) were the Gentile proselytes who worshipped God, as in ver. 43.

It is now called Cogni, and has a population of nearly thirty thousand souls. Iconium is assigned by Xenophon to Phrygia; by others to Pisidia; and again by others (Cicero, Strabo, etc.) to Lyeaonia. At this time it was the capital of a separate tetrarchy (Lewin, 'Saint Paul'), but Renan calls it\" the capital of Lycaonia\" ('Saint Paul,' p. 41).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs13:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - And the disciples, etc. Nothing can be more beautiful than this description.

With regard to this important incident at Antioch, Renan observes on its powerful influence in turning St. Paul's mind more decisively to the conversion of the Gentiles as the great object of his apostleship. He adds, \"The character of that great soul was to have a boundless power of expansion.

Speaking boldly (παρρησιαζόμενοι) in the Lord (ἐπὶ τῷ Κυρίῳ); i.e. having the Lord for their support. It was the special prayer of the Church that God would \"grant to his servants that they might speak the Word with all boldness (μετὰπαρρησίας πάσης),\" and in answer to that prayer they were enabled to speak \"the Word of God with boldness\" (Acts 4:29 , 31; comp. Acts 9:29; Acts 18:26; Acts 19:8; 1 Thessalonians 2:2, etc.). It was no small evidence of the power of the Holy Ghost that the apostles were able to speak with such uncompromising fidelity in the face of such bitter opposition.

They preached; were preaching - not once or twice, but continuously. Lystra and Derbe were cities of southern Lycaonia, obscure and remote from civilization, situated north of Mount Taurus, in a cold arid country somewhere between Ak Ghieul on the north, and the volcanic region of Karadagh on the south. They seem to have been included at this time in the dominions of Antiochus, king of Commagene (Lewin). Lystra is thought to be now represented by Bin-bir Kilissete (the thousand and one churches) (Lewin and Renan), though this is doubtful; and Derbe distant about twenty miles from Lystra, and the capital of that part of Lycaonia called Isaurica, is thought to be the modern Dioli (Hamilton, Renan, etc.); others, however, place it nearer the White Lake, Ak Ghieul, where the ruins of an ancient town are found.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there they preached the gospel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - At Lystra there sat, etc., for there sat... at Lystra, A.V.; a cripple for being a cripple, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Speaking for speak, A.V.; fastening his eyes upon for stedfastly beholding, A.V.

The force of the imperfect ἤκουε would, perhaps, be better given by \"listened\" to Paul speaking. There is great resemblance between this miracle of healing, and that of the lame man laid at the gate of the temple, who was healed by Peter (Acts 3:2-10), and, not unnaturally, considerable identity of expression in the narratives. Both men were lame from their birth; the apostles fastened their eyes upon both; both, when healed, leaped and walked; and in both cases the miracle 'had a great effect upon the multitudes who beheld it. Zeller (vol. it. p. 6), with characteristic recklessness, infers that \"this narrative was, merely in imitation of the early miraculous story of Peter;\" and so relegates both it and the subsequent narrative to the regions of fable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaid with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet.

In the speech of Lycaonia. It is not known what the language of Lycaonia was, whether Cappadocian, or Celtic, or Lycian; but we learn incidentally from Stephanus Byzantinus, that there was a Lycaonian language, for he tells us that Delbia (as some write the name Derbe) was the Lycaonian for ἄρκευθος, a juniper tree or berry. No other Lycaonian word is known (see \"Jablouskii Disquis. de Ling. Lycaon,\" in Stephan., 'Thesaur.'). The Lycaoniaus doubtless understood Greek as the language of intercommunication all over Roman Asia, but among themselves would speak their native dialect. The belief that the gods were come down in the likeness of men, and that these gods were Jupiter and Hermes, or Mercury, was most natural to Lycaonians, who were conversant with, and doubtless believed, the Phrygian legend of Philemon and Baucis, who entertained hospitably Jupiter and Hermes, when no one else would take them in, and whose cottage was by the gods turned into a temple (when all the neighborhood was drowned by a flood), of which they were made priest and priestess during life, and simultaneously metamorphosed into an oak and lime tree when their life ended (Ovid, 'Metamorph.,'8:611, etc.). Ovid places the scene of the legend at Tyana, the site of which has been ascertained by Hamilton to be near Erekli, in Cappadocia, close to the borders of Lycaonia. The moral drawn in the legend itself seems to have been that which influenced the people of Lycaonia in their conduct towards the two strangers: \"Cura pii dis sunt, et qui coluere coluntur,\" which may be Englished, \"Them that honor me I will honor\" (1 Samuel 2:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Mercury for Mercurius, A.V. For the Latin Jupiter and Mercury the Greek original has Zeus and Hermes. Jupiter is Jovis Pater, where Jovis or Diovis or Dies (in Diespiter) is the Latin form of Zeus, gen. Δίος. Mercury is Hermes in his special character as the god of markets and trade. But the Lycaonians here thought of him in his principal character of herald and messenger of the gods, and hence the god of eloquence and speech.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And for then, A.V.; whose temple was before the city for which was before their city, A.V. and T.R.; the multitudes for the people, A.V., as in ver. 12. The priest of Jupiter. The words, ὁ δὲ ἱερεὺς τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ ὄντες κ.τ.λ., may be construed in two ways - either as in the A.V., or the priest of the temple of Jupiter, etc., understanding, by a common ellipse, ἱεροῦ, or, ναοῦ, after Διός, as in the Latin phrase,\" Ubi ad Dianae veneris;\" \"When you come to the temple of Diana,\" etc. But it is not a Greek phrase to speak of Jupiter being before the city, meaning the temple of Jupiter. Therefore the proper way of translating is to take the full phrase as being ὁ ἱερεὺς τοῦ Διός ναοῦ or ἰεροῦ, the article τοῦ belonging to ναοῦ, and Διός being, as in so many instances, without the article (see Matthew, 'Gr. Gr.,' 281). The gates; viz. of the city. The temple was just outside the gates; the lame man, it is likely, sat inside near the gates through which men were passing in and out. Paul and Barnabas would address the -people in the square or open space inside the gates. Seeing a stir at the gates, and hearing that it was the priest of Jupiter coming with oxen and garlands to sacrifice to them, they immediately ran forward to prevent it. The ox was the proper sacrifice for Jupiter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But... heard of it for which ... heard of, A.V.; garments for clothes, A.V.; sprang forth for ran in, A.V.; multitudes for people, A.V., as before.

For the declaration, We also are men of like passions with you, compare Peter's saying to Cornelius (Acts 10:26), \"Stand up; I myself also am a man.\" St. Paul finely contrasts the utter vanity, i.e. the impotence, lifelessness, uselessness, and unprofitableness of the idols, with the power of the living God, who by his word created heaven and earth and sea, and filled them all with beauty, shape, and life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The generations gone by for times past, A.V.; the nations for nations, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And yet for nevertheless, A.V.; you from heaven rains for us rain from hearer, A.V. and T.R.; your for our, A.V. and T.R.

But there came Jews, etc. Observe the persistent enmity of the unbelieving Jews. The same fickleness of the multitude which led those who had cried, \"Hosanna!\" to turn round and say, \"Crucify him!\" here led those who would have worshipped Paul as a god, now to stone him as a blasphemer. This is, doubtless, the instance to which St. Paul alludes when he says \"Once was I stoned,\" (2 Corinthians 11:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - But for howbeit, A.V.; entered for came, A.V.; on the morrow for the next day, A.V.; went forth for departed, A.V.

St. Paul spoke from his own experience: \"In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft,\" etc. (2 Corinthians 11:23-27; see too 2 Timothy 3:10-12). It is very touching to see the tender care of the apostles for the young converts, lest they should fall away in time of persecution (see Acts 15:36; 1 Thessalonians 3:1, 5, 8; 1 Peter 5:8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Appointed for them for ordained them, A.V. (χειροτονήσαντες) ; had believed for believed, A.V. The original meaning of χειροτονέω is \"to stretch out the hand,\" and the substantive χειροτονία is used in the LXX. of Isaiah 58:9 for \"the putting forth of the finger\" of the A.V. But the common meaning of the verb is \"to vote by stretching out the hand\" and hence \"to elect\" by a show of hands (2 Corinthians 8:19), or simply \"to appoint,\" without any reference to voting. In the choice of an apostle the election was by lot (Acts 1:26), in the appointment of deacons the choice was by the people, how indicated we are not told (Acts 6:5); the question here, on which commentators disagree, is whether the use of the word χειροτονέω indicates voting by the people, selection by the apostles, or simple creation or appointment. As χειροτονήσαντες is predicated of Paul and Barnabas, it cannot possibly refer to voting by the people, who are included in the able, as those on whose behalf the χειροτονία was made. It seems simplest and most in accordance with the classical use of the word and its use in Acts 10:41 (προκεχειροτονημένοις), to take it in the sense of creation or appointment (see Steph., 'Thesaur.'). There is no reference to the laying on of hands. Elders (see Acts 11:30, note; Acts 20:17; and especially Titus 1:5, 7, where we see that πρεσβύτερος was synony- mous with ἐπίσκοπος). From πρεσβύτερος is formed prestos, priest, in French prestre, pretre. Comp. Acts 13:3, for fasting and prayer as accompaniments of ordination. Hence in the Church ordinations are preceded by the Ember days. They commended them to the Lord (comp. Acts 20:32).

But, instead of taking ship at Perga, after preaching the Word there they went down to Attalia, now Adalia or Satalia, the chief seaport of Pamphylia, some miles west of the month of the Cestrus, probably hearing that a ship was about to sail thence to Antioch. It does not appear that they made any converts or even preached at Attalia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They sailed for sailed, A.V.; committed for recommended, A.V.; had fulfilled for fulfilled, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs14:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - All things for all, A.V.; how that for how, A.V.; a door for the door, A.V. A door. The door is preferable, because \"the faith\" limits the door to one kind of opening. In Colossians 4:3 the case is a little different both in the A.V. and the R.V., though in the latter \"the door of the Word\" would be a truer rendering. Observe how the leading idea of the narrative is the conversion of the Gentiles.

Bishop Pearson reckons it a little more than a year; Lewin, \"about a year;\" Renan, \"several months.\" No accurate statement can be gathered from St. Luke;s indefinite expression. With this chapter closes the account of St. Paul's first missionary tour. Cony-beare and Howson (pp. 177, 213) assign to it a duration of about nine months, from early spring, March, to November, when the sea would be closed; bringing him to Perga in May, and thence for the next five or six months into the mountains of Pisidia, where it was the custom for the inhabitants of the lowlands to congregate during the hot months. Others, however, as Lewin (pp. 156, 157), think the circuit must have occupied \"about two years;\" Wieseler (p. 224), \"more than one year;\" but Renan assigns to it \"five years\" (\" Saint Paul,\" p. 55). \"Conjectural estimates vary between two and eight years\" ('Speaker's Commentary'). Lewin's estimate is, perhaps, the most probable. Whatever the exact period may have been, it was a time fruitful in consequences to the immortal interests of mankind.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Came down... and taught for which came down... taught, A.V.; saying for and said, A.V.; custom (ἔθος) for manner, A.V. Except ye be circumcised, etc. The question thus raised nearly effected the disruption of the Church, and was the most serious controversy that had yet arisen. If the views broached by these Judaean Christians had prevailed, the whole character of Christianity would have been changed, and its existence probably cut short. How great the danger was appears from even Peter and Barnabas having wavered in their opinion. (For St. Paul's treatment of the subject, see Romans 2:25, etc.; 4; Galatians 5:2-6; Galatians 6:12-15, etc.) The expression, Τινὲς κατέλθοντες ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας, is so like that in Galatians 2:11, Πρὸ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν τινὰς ἀπὸ Ἰακώβου as to suggest very strongly the consideration whether Peter was not at Antioch at this time, and whether the scene related in Galatians 2:11, etc., did not precede, and in fact cause, the Council of Jerusalem. In this case the \"dissension and disputation\" spoken of in ver. 2 would include and directly point to the memorable rebuke given by Paul to Peter; and we should understand that Peter, accepting Paul's rebuke, preceded him and Barnabas, and prepared the way at Jerusalem for the solution arrived at. And, indeed, Peter's words at Jerusalem are almost an echo of Paul's words addressed to him at Antioch. If Barnabas had shown a leaning towards the Judaizing party, he would the more readily have been accepted by them as one of the embassy. The chief objection to this hypothesis is that in Galatians 2:11 Peter's visit to Antioch seems to be spoken of as something subsequent to the journey of St. Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. But it is not in the least necessary so to understand it. St, Paul's mention of his visit to Jerusalem might naturally recall the incident which had led to it, and which was another example of his own independence. Farrar places Peter's visit to Antioch between the Council of Jerusalem and the quarrel with Barnabas, in the time indicated in ver. 35 of this chapter (vol. 1. Acts 23.), and so do Conybeare and Howson (vol. 1. p. 238), Meyer, and Alford ('Proleg.,' p. 24; note on Acts 15:36, and Galatians 2:11). Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 290, etc.) and Lewin (vol. 1. Acts 13.) place it after St. Paul's return to Antioch, at the conclusion of his second missionary journey (Acts 18:22, 23). No absolute certainty can be arrived at, but see note to ver. 35. Custom (see Acts 16:21); τὰ ἔθη is the technical term for the Mosaic institutions, used by Josephus and Philo (see too Acts 6:14; Acts 21:21, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And when for when therefore, A.V.; questioning for disputation, A.V.; the brethren (in italics) appointed for they determined, A.V. Certain other of them. One of these would be Titus (Galatians 2:1). The circumstance that, on this occasion, St. Paul did go up to those who were apostles before him, to consult with them on a matter of doctrine, shows at once why he refers so pointedly to this visit in Galatians 2:1, etc., and is almost conclusive evidence that this visit is the one there referred to. The companionship of Barnabas; the agreement of the expression, \"I went up by revelation,\" with the fact that he was sent by the Church, doubtless in obedience to some voice of the Spirit, like that mentioned in Acts 13:2; the occasion, a dispute about the circumcision of Gentile converts; the line taken by Paul and Barnabas in declaring the conversion of the Gentiles (Acts 15:4, 12; Galatians 2:27), and the result (Acts 15:19; Galatians 2:5, 7, 9), are all strong, not to say conclusive, marks of the identity of the two visits. The apostles and elders. This phrase marks the constitution of the governing part of the Church of Jerusalem. The addition in vers. 22 and 23 of \"the whole Church,\" and (according to the T.R.) of \"the brethren,\" shows the part the body of the believers had in approving and sanctioning the decisions of the elders. The transaction marks the position of the Church of Jerusalem as the metropolitan Church of Christendom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - They therefore... passed for and... they passed, A.V.; both Phoenicia for Phonice, A.V.

This, of course, would have included Titus, who was present with St. Paul (Galatians 2:1, 3).

A special meeting of the Church was called to consider the matter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Questioning for disputing, A.V., as in ver. 2; brethren for men and brethren, A.V., as in Acts 7:2, etc.; you for us, A.V. and T.R.; by my mouth the Gentiles for the Gentiles by my mouth, A.V. Questioning. It was a repetition of the same scene that took place at Antioch. Peter, etc. It seems to have been wise on Peter's part to allow the meeting to exhaust itself by fruitless disputations before he rose to speak. His rising, with all the authority of his person and position, commanded immediate attention. A good while ago; literally, from ancient days, or still more exactly, from the days of the beginning of the gospel (ἡμεραὶ ἀρχαίαι), days belonging to the beginning (ἀρχή) of the Church's existence, and dating far back in Peter's own apostolic life. Nothing can be more natural than this allusion to the conversion of Cornelius, and the gift of the Holy Ghost to the Gentile inmates of his house, as related in Acts 10:44.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Heart for hearts, A.V. (καρδιογνώστης). Bare them witness; i.e. set the mark of his approval upon them, vouched for their sincerity (see the use of the verb μαρτυρέω in Luke 4:22; John 3:26; Acts 6:3; Acts 10:22, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - He made no distinction for put no difference, A.V. (comp. Acts 10:20, note); cleansing for purifying, A.V. This is exactly the doctrine of Galatians 2:16 and Romans 3:30, with which compare also ver. 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - That ye should put for to put, A.V. The Greek words cannot be construed as the A.V. takes them. It is not a Greek construction to say πειράζειν τινα ποιεῖν κακόν, \"to tempt any one to do evil.\" The infinitive ἐπιθεῖναι must be taken gerundially, \"by placing,\" or \"putting,\" and the sense is - Why do you try God's patience by your provocation in putting an unbearable yoke upon the necks of those who believe? Or, \"as if he had not power to save by faith\" (Chrysostom).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - We shall be saved through the grace, etc., for through the grace... we shall be saved, A.V.; Jesus for Jesus Christ, A.V. and T.R.; in like manner for even, A.V. \"How full of power are these words! The same that Paul says at large in the Epistle to the Romans, the same says Peter here\" (Chrysost., ' Hem.,' 32.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And for then, A.V.; they hearkened for gave audience, A.V.; rehearsing what signs for declaring what miracles, A.V. Kept silence; marking the contrast between the noisy questionings and disputings which had preceded Peter's speech, and the quiet orderly attention with which they now listened to Paul and Barnabas, telling them of the conversion of the Gentiles. It recalls Virgil's description of the effect of the presence of a man of grave piety upon an excited crowd -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Tum, pielate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quemNEWLINEAspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adslant.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(AEneid,' 1:152.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Brethren for men and brethren, A.V., as ver. 7. James answered. James's place as presiding bishop is here distinctly marked by his summing up the debate. \"This (James)was bishop, as they say, and, therefore, he speaks last\" (Chrysost., ' Hem.,' 33.). And again, \"No word speaks John here, no word the other apostles, but held their peace, for James was invested with the chief rule.\" \"He says well with authority, 'My sentence is\" (ibid.). A remarkable testimony against papal supremacy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSimeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Symeon for Simeon, A.V.; rehearsed for declared, A.V.; first God for God at the first, A.V. Symeon. This is the only place (unless Symeon is the right reading in 2 Peter 1:1) in which Simon Peter's name is given in this Hebrew form, which is most proper in the month of James speaking to Palestine Jews. Singularly enough, Chrysostom was misled by it, and thought the prophecy of Simeon in Luke 1:31 was meant, How first; corresponding to the\" good while ago\" of ver. 7. Did visit, etc. The construction ἐπεσκέψατο λαβεῖν is very unusual, and indeed stands alone. The verb always has an accusative case after it (Acts 6:3; Acts 7:23; Acts 15:36), unless Luke 1:68 is an exception, which, however, it hardly is. There are two ways of construing the phrase. One is to consider it as elliptical, and to supply, as the A.V. and R.V. do, τὰ ἐθνή. So Alford, who compares the construction in Luke 1:25, where ἐπ ἐμέ must be supplied. But this is a harsh construction. The other and better way is to take ἐπεσκεψατο, not in the sense of\" visiting,\" but of\" looking out,\" or \"endeavoring to find something.\" The sense of the infinitive after the verb is nearly equivalent to\" look out for and took,\" literally, looked out how he might take. With a slight modification of meaning, Irenaeus (in 'Speaker's Commentary') renders it\" Excogitavit accipere,\" \"planned\" or \"contrived to take.\" A people for his Name; 1.e. to be called by his Name. Λαός was the peculiar designation of \"the people\" of God, answering to the Hebrew עַם (comp. 1 Peter 2:10, Οἱ ποτὲ οὐ λαὸς νῦν δὲ λαὸς Θεοῦ).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - These things for this, A.V.; I will for will, A.V.; fallen for fallen down, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - May for might, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnown unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Who maketh these things known, etc., for who doeth all these things (in ver. 17 of A.V.); known for known unto God are all his works, A.V. and T.R. Known from the beginning of the world. The above passage from Amos 9:11, 12, is quoted, not very exactly, though with no change of sense, from the LXX., where it ends with the words, \"saith the Lord, who doeth all these things,\" as in the A.V. But the LXX. ver. 17 differs widely from the present Hebrew text. For whereas the Hebrew has, \"That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen that are called by my Name,\" the LXX. (Cod. Alex.) have Ὅπως α}ν ἐκζητήσωσιν οἱ κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων τὸν Κύριον καὶ ππάντα τὰ ἔθνη κ.τ.λ., where it is evident that they read יִדְרְשׁוּ, seek after, for יֵרְשׁוּ, possess, and אָדָם, men, for אֶדום, Edom. There is every appearance of the LXX., followed here by St. James, having preserved the true reading. As regards the reading of the R.V. in ver. 18, it is a manifest corruption. It is not the reading of either the Hebrew or the Greek version of Amos, or of any other version; and it makes no sense. Whereas the T.R., which is the reading of Irenaeus (3:12.), as Meyer truly says, \"presents a thought completely clear, pious, noble, and inoffensive as regards the connection,\" though he thinks that a reason for rejecting it. Nothing could be more germane to St. James's argument than thus to show from the words of Amos that God's present purpose of taking the Gentiles to be his people was, like all his other works, formed from the beginning of the world (comp. Ephesians 1:9, 10; Ephesians 3:5, 6; 2 Timothy 1:9, etc.). As regards the interpretation of the prophecy of Amos intended, the idea seems to be that that apparent ruin of the house and family of David which culminated in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus would be followed by those \"sure mercies of David,\" which consisted in his resurrection from the dead, his exaltation to the right hand of God, and the gathering in of the Gentiles to his kingdom. The phrase, \"the tabernacle of David,\" is rather difficult, because the word in the Hebrew is סֻכַּת דָזִיד, tabernacle or booth of David. It is the word used for the booths at the Feast of Tabernacles, and denotes a temporary shed of branches or the like of a very humble character. It is difficult to say why this word was used, unless it was to show that the house of David had fallen to a low estate before it was pulled down.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Judgment for sentence, A.V. (ἐγὼ κρίνω); turn for are turned, A.V. (ἐπιστρέφουσιν Judgment. Sentence is the best word, as expressing the decisive judgment of St. James, which, being delivered with the authority of his office at the close of the debate, carried with it the suffrages of the whole council. The things decreed by them were called Τὰ δόγματα τὰ κεκρίμενα ὑπὸ σῶν ἀποστόλων καὶ τῶν πρεσβυτέρων Turn. It applies to those that should hereafter turn as well as to those who were already turned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The pollutions for pollutions, A.V.; what is strangled for things strangled, A.V. The pollutions. In the decree itself (ver. 29) this is explained by εἰδωλοθύτων, things offered to idols, though some apply the \"pollutions\" to all the things here mentioned, not the idols only. Later St. Paul somewhat enlarged the liberty of Gentile converts in respect to meats offered to idols (see 1 Corinthians 8:4-13; 1 Corinthians 10:25-28). What is strangled, etc. The things forbidden are all practices not looked upon as sins by Gentiles, but now enjoined upon them as portions of the Law of Moses which were to be binding upon them, at least for a time, with a view to their living in communion and fellowship with their Jewish brethren. The necessity for some of the prohibitions would cease when the condition of the Church as regards Jews and Gentiles was altered; others were of eternal obligation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - From generations of old for of old time, A.V.; sabbath for sabbath day, A.V. The meaning of this verse seems to be that, in requiring the above compliances, the council was not enjoining anything new or strange, because the Gentiles who attended the synagogues were familiar with these Mosaic doctrines. It has been often stated that these four prohibitions were in substance the same as the so-called seven precepts of Noah, which were binding upon proselytes of the gate. This is, however, scarcely borne out by the facts. The four prohibitions seem to have been a temporary arrangement adapted to the then condition of the Church, with a view to enabling Christian Jews and Gentiles to live in brotherly fellowship. The Jew was not to require more of his Gentile brother: the Gentile was not to concede less to his Jewish brother. St. Augustine ('Cont. Manich.,' 32, 13), quoted by Meyer, ridicules the idea of Christians in his time being bound by the law of things strangled (see Hooker and Bishop Sanderson, quoted by Wordsworth, in the same sense).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - It seemed good to for pleased it, A.V.; the elders for elders, A.V.; to choose men out of their company and send them, etc., for to send chosen men of their own company, A.V.; Barsabbas for Barsabas, A.V. and T.R., as Acts 1:23. To choose men, etc. This is a necessary, change, because the middle aorist (ἐκκεξαμένους) cannot have a passive meaning (chosen); see ver. 40. Chief men (ἡγουμένους); literally, leaders. So in Luke 22:26 Ὁ ἡγούμενος is rendered, \"He that is chief.\" In Hebrews 13:7, Οἱ ἡγούμενοι ὑμῶν is, \"Them which have the rule over you;\" your spiritual rulers. Silas seems to be a contraction of Silvanus, like Lucas for Lucanus. In the Acts he is always called Silas, in the Epistles of St. Paul and St. Peter, Silvanus. Going as direct emissaries from James and the Church of Jerusalem, and Judas would have great weight with the Jews in Syria and Cilicia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Wrote thus by them for wrote letters by them after this manner, A.V.; the elder brethren for elders and brethren, A.V.; unto... greeting for send greeting unto, etc., A.V., as Acts 23:26. The elder brethren, etc. The grammar of the sentence is irregular, as there is nothing for γράψαντες to agree with. But \"the elder brethren\" is a phrase unknown to the Scriptures, and it is much more in accordance with the feeling of the times that \"the brethren,\" i.e. the whole Church, should be included in the salutation. Greeting. It is remarkable that the only other place in the New Testament where this Greek salutation occurs is James 1:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The words in the A.V. and the T.R., saying, Ye must be circumcised and keep the Law, are omitted in the R.T. and the R.V.; commandment for such commandment, A.V. The certain which went out from us are the same as the \"certain men\" which \"came down from Judaea,\" of ver. 1. The word rendered subverting (ἀνασκευάζοντες) occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in the LXX. It is spoken properly of a person who moves and carries off all the goods and furniture from the house which he is quitting. Hence to \"disturb,\" \"throw into confusion, turn upside down,\" and the like. To whom we gave no commandment. Observe the distinct disavowal by James of having authorized those who went forth from him and the Jerusalem Church to require the circumcision of the Gentiles. The A.V. expresses the meaning most clearly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Having come to for being assembled with, A.V.; to choose out men and send them for to send chosen men, A.V. (see note on ver. 22). Having come, etc. The Greek is capable of either meaning. Alford prefers that of the A.V. Others think that stress is laid upon the decree being unanimous. Our beloved Barnabas and Paul. James and the council thus gave their full and open support to Barnabas and Paul. Observe that Barnabas is named first, as in ver. 12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Themselves also shall for shall also, A.V.; by word of mouth for by mouth, A.V.

It implies the consciousness on the part of the council that they had \"the mind of the Spirit;\" but how this mind of the Spirit was communicated we are not expressly told. There may have been some \"revelation,\" similar to that recorded in Acts 13:2; Acts 10:19; Galatians 2:1, etc. It is, however, generally understood as resting upon Christ's promise to be with his Church always. Hefele ('Hist. of Christian Councils,' pp. 1,2, English translation) quotes Cyprian as writing to Pope Cornelius in the name of the Council of A.D. : \"Placuit nobis, Sancto Spiritu suggerente;\" and the Synod of Aries as saying, \"Placuit, praesenti Spiritu Sancto.\" And this is the general language of the synods. Constantine claimed for the decrees of the three hundred bishops at Nicaea the same authority as if they had been \"solius Filii Dei sententia.\" But, as Bishop Wordsworth on Acts 15:28 wisely says, \"It cannot be held that councils of the Church now are entitled to adopt the words of the text in the framing of canons.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Things sacrificed for meats offered, A.V.; it shall be well with you for ye shall do well, A.V. The phrase εῦ πράσσειν means to\" prosper,\" to \"fare well\" (comp. Ephesians 6:21, \"How I do\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - They, when they were dismissed, came down for when they were dismissed, they came, A.V.; having gathered for when they had gathered, A.V. The multitude does not exactly express the idea of τὸ πλῆθος, which is the fullness or the whole of the body spoken cf. Thus Luke 1:10, Πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ is \"The whole congregation;\" Luke 2:13, Πλῆθος στρατιᾶς οὐρανίου is \"The whole heavenly host;\" Luke 19:37, Ἄπαν τὸ πλῆθος τῶν μαθητῶν, \"The whole company of the disciples;\" also Acts 6:2 and Acts 4:32, Τὸ πλῆθος τῶν πιστευσάντων is \"The whole company of believers;\" Acts 22:36, Τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ is \"The whole body of the people;\" in ver. 12 of this chapter, Πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος is \"The whole Church of Jerusalem.\" So here, Τὸ πλῆθος means \"The whole Church.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - And when they had read it for which when they had read, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Being themselves also prophets for being prophets also themselves, A.V. Being themselves also prophets, exhorted, etc. Observe the connection of exhortation with prophecy, and compare the explanation of the name of Barnabas in Acts 4:36, note. Confirmed them; ἐπεστήριξαν, as ver. 41 and Acts 14:22; Acts 18:23. Nothing is so unsettling as controversy; but the preaching of these \"chief men\" brought back men's minds to the solid faith and hope of the gospel. How rich the Church of Antioch was at this time, with Paul and Barnabas, Judas and Silas, and probably Titus, and some, if not all, of those mentioned in Acts 13:1, for their teachers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Spent some time there for tarried there a space, A.V.

It seems to have been put in to explain ver. 40. But Silas may have returned to Jerusalem, as stated in ver. 33, and come back again to Antioch, from having formed a strong attachment to St. Paul and his views.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPaul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - But Paul for Paul also, A.V.; tarried for continued, A.V. It is at this time that Meyer and other commentators (see ver. 1, note) place Peter's visit to Antioch mentioned in Galatians 2:11. But it is quite inconceivable that Peter, with all the influence of the Jerusalem Cornell fresh upon him, and after the part he himself took in it, and when his own emissaries, Silas and Judas, had just left Antioch, should act the part there ascribed to him. Nor is it within the region of probability that, so soon after the council, any should have come \"from James\" to unsay what James had said and written at the council. We may with much confidence place Peter's visit to Antioch before the council, as suggested in note to ver. 1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - After some days for some days after, A.V.; return now for go again, A.V.; the brethren for our brethren, A.V. and T.R.; wherein we proclaimed for where we have preached, A.V.; fare for do, A.V. After some days is hardly equivalent to μετά τινας ἡμέρας. The expression in Greek is quite indefinite as to time, and may cover months as well as days. That it does cover a considerable length of time we gather from the expression in ver. 33, that Judas and Silas \"tarried some time at Jerusalem,\" followed by that in ver. 35, that after their departure \"Paul and Barnabas tarried (διέτριβον) in Antioch.\" We can hardly suppose the two periods together to have included much less than a year. Let us return, etc. The singular loving care of Paul for his young converts appears here (comp. 1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8; 1 Thessalonians 3:5-8; 2 Corinthians 1:14, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Was minded for determined, A.V. and T.R.; John also for John, A.V. and T.R.; who was called for whose surname was, A.V. Was minded. It is doubtful which is the true reading, ἐβουλεύσατο or ἐβούλετο. The difference of meaning is small. The first means \"took council with himself,\" i.e. planned, thought, to take Barnabas; the second, \"wished,\" i.e. his deliberate will was to take Barnabas. Singularly enough, Alford, who rejects ἐβούλετο, which is the reading of R.T., translates ἐβουλεύετο by \"was minded,\" which is the translation of ἐβούλετο in the R.V. We see in this choice of Mark by Barnabas the natural partiality of a near relation. We may also see the same flexibility of disposition which made him yield to the influence of the emissaries of James (Galatians 2:13). Who was called. It might seem odd that this description of John should be repeated here after having been given in Acts 12:25. But perhaps it was usual so to designate him (see Luke 8:2; Luke 22:3; Matthew 10:3; Acts 1:23; Acts 10:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Take with them him for take him with them, A.V.; withdrew for departed, A.V. Withdrew. The Greek word ἀποστάντα (from which comes the substantive apostasy) is a strong one, and denotes decided blame, as does the indication of the opposite course, by way of contrast, which he did not take. \"He did not go with them to the work\" to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded. \"Paul thought good,\" as regards one who had turned back from the work, \"not to take that man.\" The μὴ συμπαραλαβεῖν of ver. 38 is, as Meyer observes, sharply opposed to the συμπαραλαβεῖν of ver. 37. Luke evidently sides strongly with Paul, and almost reproduces the ipsis-sima verba of the \"sharp contention.\" One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in 2 Timothy 4:11, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of \"The Acts.\" Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure \"from the work\" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - There arose a sharp contention for the contention was so sharp between them, A.V. and T.R.; parted for departed, A.V.; so that for so sharp... that, A.V.; and Barnabas for and so Barnabas, A.V.; took Mark with him for took Mark, A.V.; sailed away for sailed, A.V. There arose a sharp contention, etc. The sense \"between them\" must be supplied, if the English word \"contention\" is used. The word παροξυσμός only occurs twice in the New Testament: once in Hebrews 10:24, in a good sense, \"To provoke\" (for a provocation) - \" stimulate or excite\" - \" unto love and good works,\" which is its common classical sense; the other time in this passage, where the sense is attributed to it in which it is used in the LXX., as in Deuteronomy 29:28, Ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ὀργῇ καὶ παροξυσμῷ μεγάλῳ σφόδρα, \"in great indignation;\" and in Jeremiah 32:37 (39. 37, LXX.), coupled with the same words, ἐν παροξυσμῷ μεγάλῳ, \"in great wrath;\" answering to קֶצפin Hebrew. But it is more probable that St. Luke uses the word here in its common medical sense. In medical writers - Galen, Hippocrates, etc. - the παροξυσμός is equivalent to what we call an access, from the Latin aecessio, used by Celsus, when a disease of some standing takes a turn for the worse, comes to a height, and breaks out into its severest form. This is the sense in which our English word \"paroxysm\" is used. The meaning of the passage will then be that, after a good deal of uncomfortable feeling and discussion, the difference between Paul and Barnabas, instead of cooling down, broke out into such an acute form that Barnabas went off to Cyprus with Mark, leaving St. Paul to do what he pleased by himself. And Barnabas, etc. The R.V. is much more accurate. The consequence of the quarrel is said by St. Luke to have been that Barnabas took Mark off with him to Cyprus. The statement that Paul chose Silas is a separate and independent statement, as appears by Παῦλος (in the nominative) and ἐξῆλθε in the indicative mood. St. Luke's narrative quite sides with St. Paul, and throws the blame of the quarrel, or at least of the separation, upon Barnabas. Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 119) thinks St. Paul was too severe upon John Mark, and that it was ungrateful of him to break with one to whom he owed so much as he did to Barnabas for any cause of secondary importance. He also thinks that the real root of the quarrel lay in the constantly changing relations between the two apostles, aggravated by a domineering spirit in St. Paul. But the force of this censure turns upon the question whether it was a cause of secondary importance. If St. Paul had a single eye to the success of his mission, and judged that Mark would be a hindrance to it, it was a question of primary importance to \"the work,\" and St. Paul was right. Renan also remarks upon the extinction of the fame of Barnabas consequent upon this separation from his more illustrious companion. \"While Paul kept advancing to the heights of his glory, Barnabas, separated from the companion who had shed a portion of his own luster upon him, pursued his solitary course in obscurity.\" Sailed away. Cyprus was Barnabas's native country (Acts 4:36), and the scene of the earliest mission (Acts 11:19), and of Paul and Barnabas's first joint evangelistic labors (Acts 13:4). Barnabas would have many friends there, and could form plans at his leisure for his future action. The friendly mention of him in 1 Corinthians 9:6 shows both that he continued his disinterested labors as an apostle and that the estrangement between him and St. Paul had passed away. The paroxysm had yielded to the gentle treatment of charity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - But for and, A.V.; went forth or departed, A.V.; commended for recommended, A.V.; to for unto, A.V.; the Lord for God, A.V. and T.R.

Otherwise there is no difficulty in supposing that Silas, attracted by the holy zeal of St. Paul and by desire to work among the Gentiles, had come back to Antioch after giving account to the apostles at Jerusalem of the success of his mission with Judas to the Churches at Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs15:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Syria and Cilicia (see ver. 23). This rather looks as if the \"some days after\" of ver. 36 did not cover a very long time, because the special mention of \"the Churches of Syria and Cilicia\" indicates that St. Paul's visit had some connection with the epistle addressed to them by the apostles and elders of the Church of Jerusalem (ver. 23), as we see from Acts 16:4 was the case. Confirming; as Acts 14:22; Acts 15:32; Acts 18:22 (T.R.). In the passive voice ἐπιστηρίζομαι means to \"lean upon,\" as in 2 Samuel 1:6, LXX., and in classical Greek. Renan thus indicates their probable route: \"They traveled by land northwards across the plain of Antioch, went through the 'Syrian Gates,' coasted the gulf of the Issus, crossed the northern branch of the Issus through the 'Amanean Gates,' then,, traversing Cilicia, went perhaps through Tarsus, crossed Mount Taurus through the 'Cilician Gates,' one of the most terrible passes in the world, and thus reached Lycaonia, going as far as Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium\" ('St. Paul,' p. 123).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - And he came also for then came he, A.V. and T.R.; to Lystra for Lystra, A.V.; Timothy for Timotheus, A.V.; of a Jewess for of a certain woman which was a Jewess, A.V. and T.R.; which for and, A.V.

A certain disciple; i.e. a Christian (Acts 11:26). From St. Paul's speaking of Timothy as \"my own sou in the faith\" (1 Timothy 1:2; 2 Timothy 1:2), and from his special mention of Timothy's mother Eunice (2 Timothy 1:5), it is probable that both mother and son were converted by St. Paul at his first visit to Lystra, some years before (Acts 14:7). Timothy. It is a Greek name, meaning \"one who honors God\" (formed, like Timoleon, Timolaus, Timocrates, etc.). It was a not uncommon name, and occurs repeatedly in the Books of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 5:6; 2 Macc. 8:30, etc.). Another form is Timesitheos. Timothy is uniformly spoken of by St. Paul in terms of eulogy and warm affection (see, besides the passages above quoted, Romans 16:21; 1 Corinthians 4:17; 1 Corinthians 16:10; Philippians 2:19-22; and the general tone of the Epistles to Timothy). A Jewess; viz. Eunice (2 Timothy 1:5), also a Greek name (equivalent to Victoria), though borne by a Jewess. A Greek; i.e. a Gentile (see Hark 7:26; Acts 14:1; Acts 17:4; Acts 19:10; Romans 1:16; Romans 2:9; 1 Corinthians 10:32, etc.; Colossians 3:11).

And it could be done without prejudice to the rights of Gentile converts as established in the decrees of which St. Paul was bearer. Because of the Jews; not the Christian Jews, who ought to know better than trust in circumcision, but the unbelieving Jews, who would be scandalized if St. Paul had an uncircumcised man for his fellow-laborer (see 1 Corinthians 10:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Went on their way for went, A.V.; which had been for that were, A.V.; that for which, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - So for and so, A.V.; the Churches were strengthened for were the Churches established, A.V.

Colossians 2:5, Τὸ στερέωμα τῆς εἰς Ξριστὸν πίστεως ὑμῶν, \"The steadfastness of your faith.\" The word is used in its physical sense in Acts 3:7, Ἐστερεώθησαν αὐτοῦ αἱ βάσεις κ.τ.λ., \"His feet and anklebones received strength,\" became fast and firm instead of being loose and vacillating.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And they went for now when they had gone, A.V. and T.R.; through the region of Phrygia and Galatia for throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, A.V. and T.R.; having been for and were, A.V.; speak for preach, A.V. The region of Phrygia and Galatia. But Phrygia is always a noun substantive, and cannot be here taken as an adjective belonging to χώρα: and we have in Acts 18:23 exactly the same collation as that of the A.V. here, only in an inverted order: Τὴν Γαλατικὴν χώραν καὶ Φρυγίας. Even if the τὴν is properly omitted, as in the R.T., before Γαλατικὴν, the passage must equally be construed as in the A.V. The Galatians were Celts, the descendants of those Gauls who invaded Asia in the third century B.C. This passage seems to show conclusively that Derbe and Lystra and Iconium were not comprehended by St. Paul under Galatia, and were not the Churches to whom the Epistle to the Galatians was addressed; and forcibly suggest that the Galatian Churches were founded by St. Paul in the course of the visit here so briefly mentioned by St. Luke. Asia is here used in its restricted sense of that district on the western coast of Asia Minor, of which Ephesus was the capital. It is in this sense that it is used also in Acts 2:9; Acts 6:9; Acts 19:10, etc.; Revelation 1:11. St. Paul apparently wished to go to Ephesus. But the time was not yet come. It was the purpose of the Holy Ghost that the Galatian Churches should be founded first, and then the Churches of Macedonia and Achaia. The apostles were sent, did not go anywhere of their own accord (comp. Matthew 10:5, 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And when for after, A.V. and T.R.; come over against (κατὰ) for come to, A.V.; and the Spirit of Jesus for but the Spirit, A.V. and T.R.

They would have gone north to Bithynia, where, we know from 1 Peter 1:1, there were many Jews. But the Spirit ordered them westwards, to the seacoast of Troas, that they might be ready to sail for Macedonia. In like manner Abraham went out not knowing whither he went (Hebrews 11:8). Truly the footsteps of God's providence are not known!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - There was a man... standing, beseeching him, and saying for there stood a man... and prayed him, saying, A.V. Thus was ushered in the most momentous event in the history of Europe, the going forth of the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem to enlighten the nations of the West, and bring them into the fold of Jesus Christ. Paul saw and heard this in a vision in the night. It is net called a dream (Bengel), but was like the vision seen by Ananias (Acts 9:10), and those seen by Paul (Acts 9:12; Acts 10:5; Acts 18:9). A vision (ὅραμα) is distinguished from a dream (ἐνύπνιον, Acts 2:17). It is applied to things of a marvelous character seen objectively, as to the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:9)and to the burning bush (Acts 7:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When for after, A.V.; straightway for immediately, A.V.; sought for endeavored, A.V.; go forth for go, A.V.; concluding fur assuredly gathering, A.V.; God for the Lord, A.V. and T.R. Concluding; συμβιβάζοντες, only here in the sense of \"concluding or \"gathering.\" In Acts 9:22 it is \"proving.\" In Ephesians 4:16 and Colossians 2:2 it means to \"join together.\" In classical Greek to \"bring together\" in the sense of\" reconciling,\" sometimes of\" agreeing\" to a proposition. In the LXX., to ,' instruct,\" \"teach\" (1 Corinthians 2:16). In this verse we first remark the very important introduction of the pronoun we into the narrative, marking the presence of the historian himself, and showing that he first joined St. Paul at Tread He went with him to Philippi (ver. 12), and there he appears to have stopped till St. Paul returned there in his third missionary journey on his way from Achaia to Jerusalem (Acts 20:5, 6), where we find him still with the apostle (Acts 20:17, 18). We again find him with St. Paul at Caesarea, while he was a prisoner there (Acts 27:1), and he accompanied him on the voyage to Rome, which is the last place where we heir of him (Acts 27:2, 3. etc.; Acts 28:2, 11, 14-16; Colossians 4:14; Philemon 1:24). It is quite characteristic of Holy Scripture that things are told, or appear on the face of the narrative, without any explanation. Who Luke was, what brought him to Troas, how he became a companion of St. Paul, whether as his medical adviser or otherwise, we know not. His Christian modesty forbade his speaking about himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Setting sail therefore for therefore loosing, A.V.; made for came with, A.V. (εὐθυδρόμεω, elsewhere only in Acts 21:1); Samothrace for Samothracia, A.V.; day following for next day, A.V. In the New Testament this latter phrase only occurs in the Acts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - A city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony for the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony, A.V.: this for that, A.V.; tarrying for abiding, A.V. A city of Macedonia, etc. This is a difficult sentence. The natural way of construing the words undoubtedly is, as in the A.V., \"which is the chief city of the [or, ' that'] district of Macedonia, and a colony.\" The only difficulty in the way of so taking it is that when AEmilius Paulus, as related by Livy (45:29), divided the conquered kingdom of Macedonia into four districts (regiones or partes), Amphi-pelts was made the capital of the district in which Philippi was situated. But the epithet πρώτη does not necessarily mean the capital; it is found on coins applied to cities which were not capitals. Besides, in the interval of above two hundred years between Aemilius Paulus and St. Paul (from s.c. 167 to A.D. ), it is very probable that the city of Philippi, with its gold-mines and its privileges as a colony, may have really become the capital. And so Lewin, following Wetstein, understands it (vol. it. p. 209). We know that in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia was divided into two provinces, Philippi became the ecclesiastical head of Macedonia Prima. It had been made a colony by Augustus Caesar, with the name \"Col. Jul. Aug. Philip.,\" i.e. Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis ('Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). It must, therefore, anyhow have been a place of first-rate importance at this time. Those, however, who do not accept this explanation, couple κολωνία with πόλις, \"which is the first colony-city,\" etc, Others take πρώτη in a local sense, \"the first city you come to in Macedonia\" (Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Bengel, etc.). The R.V. seems to take ἥτις ἐστὶ... Μακεδονίας πόλις together, and πρώτη τῆς μερίδος as a further description of it - a most awkward construction. Alford renders it, \"which is the first Macedonian city of the district.' But the natural way of construing a passage is almost always the best, and nothing prevents us from believing that St. Luke, who knew Philippi intimately, was strictly accurate in calling it \"the chief city of the district of Macedonia,\" i.e. the district in which it was situated. That μέρις is the technical name of the division of a province appears from the title μεριδάρχης, applied by Josephus to a certain Apollonius, governor, under Antiochus Epiphanes, of the district in which Samaria was included ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 5:5). The ancient name of Philippi was Dates first, then Krenides - the springs, or wells; and the word used by Livy of the districts of Macedonia, pars prima, secunda, etc., is an exact translation of μέρις It received the name of Philippi, from Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who extracted a great revenue from its gold-mines. Its great historical celebrity arises from the battle in the plain of Philippi, in which the republican party, under Brutus and Cassius, received its death-blow from Octavius and Antony. (For a full description of Philippi, and of the privileges of a colony, see Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:311, etc., and Lewin, vol. 1. Acts 11.) This. Alford, following certain manuscripts, reads αὐτῇ, \"in the city itself,\" as distinguished from the place outside the city, where the προσευχή was. But, perhaps, St. Luke uses the word \"this\" from Philippi being the place of his own residence, and where he may have drawn up the narrative on the spot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Sabbath day for sabbath, A.V.; we went forth without the gate for we went out of the city, A.V. and T.R. (πύλης for πολέως); we supposed there Was a place of prayer for prayer was wont to be made, A.V.; were come together for resorted thither, A.V. By a river side. By the river side is the natural way of expressing it in English. The river is not the Strymon, which is a day's journey distant from Philippi, but probably a small stream called the Gangas or Gangites, which is crossed by the Via Eguatia, about a mile out of Philippi. The neighborhood of water, either near a stream or on the seashore, was usually preferred by the Jews as a place for prayer, as affording facility for ablutions (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 14:10, 23; and other passages quoted by Alford). The phrase, οϋ ἐνομίζετο προσευχὴ εῖναι, should be rendered, not as in the R.V., but more nearly as the A.V., where a prayer-meeting(of the Jews) was accustomed to be held; i.e. this particular spot was the usual place where such Jews or proselytes as happened to be at Philippi met for prayer. It also appears from Epiphanius (' Hear.,' 80, § 1, quoted by Alford) that the Jews usually had their προσευχαί, whether buildings, or open spaces, ἔξω πολέως, outside the city. The wayside crosses are of the nature of προσευχαί.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - One that for which, A.V.; to give heed for that she attended, A.V.; by for of, A.V. A certain woman, etc. Whether her personal name was Lydia, or whether she was commonly so called on account of her native country and her trade, must remain uncertain. Thyatira was in Lydia. Lydian women, from the time of Homer downwards, were famous for their purple dyes; and it appears from an inscription found in Thyatira, that there was there a guild of dyers, called οἱ βαφεῖς (Lewin, 2:214). One that worshipped God (σεβομένη τὸν Θεὸν); i.e. a proselyte. So in Acts 13:43 we find οἱ σεβόμενοι προσήλυτοι the devout or religious proselytes. And so αἱ σεβόμεναι γυναῖκες, the devout women. And so, in Acts 18:7, Justus is described as σεβόμενος τὸν Θεὸν one who worshipped God (see too Acts 17:4, 17). In Acts 10:1 Cornelius is spoken of as εὐσεβὴς καὶ φοβούμενος τὸν Θεὸν. It has been suggested that possibly Euodias and Syntyche (Philippians 4:2) were of the same class, and converted at the same time as Lydia. There is certainly a coincidence between the mention of the women in ver. 13 and the prominence given to the Philippian women in Philippians 4:2, 3. It is well observed by Chrysostom, on the latter part of this verse, \"The opening of the heart was God's work, the attending was hers: so that it was both God's doing and man's\" (camp. Philippians 2:12, 13). To open (διανοίγειν) is applied as here to the heart (2 Macc. 1:4); to the eyes (Luke 24:31); to the ears (Mark 7:34, 35); to the understanding (Luke 24:45); to the Scriptures (Luke 24:32); \"Corclausum per se. Dei est id aporire \"(Bengel).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there.

Hebrews 6:2). And her household (comp. ver. 33; 1 Corinthians 1:16; 2 Timothy 4:19). This frequent mention of whole households as received into the Church seems necessarily to imply infant baptism. The exhortations to children as members of the Church in Ephesians 6:1, 2, and Colossians 3:20, lead to the same inference. Come into my house, etc. A beautiful specimen of true hospitality; comp. 1 Peter 4:9; Hebrews 13:2; 1 Timothy 5:10 3John 5-8; also 2 Kings 4:8-10, where, however, the Greek word for \"constrained\" is ἐκράτησεν, not as here παρεβίασατο, which only occurs elsewhere in the New Testament in Luke 24:29. In the LXX. it is used in 1 Samuel 28:23; Gem 19:3 (Cod. Alex.) 9 (in a different sense); 2 Kings 2:17; 2 Kings 5:16. Her large hospitality does not bear out Chrysostom's remark as to her humble station of lift,.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Were going to the place of prayer for went to prayer, A.V. and T.R.; that a certain maid for a certain damsel, A.V.; having for possessed with, A.V. The place of prayer. The ἡ προσευχή of the R.T. undoubtedly means \"the place of prayer,\" the proseuche. They went there, doubtless, every sabbath. What follows happened on one occasion after Lydia's baptism. A spirit of divination (πνεῦμα Πύθωνος, A.V.; Πύθωνα, R.T.). \"Πύθων denotat quemlibet ex quo πύθωσθαι datur,\" \"any one of whom inquiry may be made\" (Bengel). It was a name of Apollo in his character of a giver of oracles. Delphi itself, where his chief oracle was, was sometimes called Pytho (Schleusner, s.v.), and Pythius was a common epithet of Apollo. The name Python (Plut.,' De Defect. Orac.,' cap. 9) came thence to be applied to a ventriloquist (Hebrew אוב), or to the spirit that was conceived to dwell in ventriloquists and to speak by them, just as in Hebrew the ventriloquist was sometimes called בְעַל אוב (or בַעֻלַת if a woman), the owner of a spirit of divination, or simply אוב, a diviner (see 1 Samuel 28:7 (twice) for the first use, and Leviticus 20:27; Deuteronomy 18:11; 1 Samuel 28:3; for the second). In some passages, as 1 Kings 28:6 and Isaiah 29:4, it is doubtful whether אוב means the ventriloquist or the spirit. The feminine plural אובות (Leviticus 19:31; Leviticus 20:6; 1 Samuel 28:3, 9; Isaiah 8:19) seems always to denote the women, who, like the damsel in the text, practiced the art of ventriloquistic necromancy, whether really possessed by a spirit or feigning to be so. The word πύθων is only found here in the New Testament. The LXX. usually render אובות by ἐγγαστρίμυθος. Gain (ἐργασία), literally, work, craft, or trade; then, by metonymy, the gain proceeding from such trade (Acts 19:24, 25). By soothsaying (μαντευομένη). So one name of these ventriloquists was ἐγγαστρίμαντις.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Following after... cried out for followed... and cried, A.V.; servants for the servants, A.V.; proclaim unto you for show unto us, A.V. and T.R. This testimony of the spirit of divination to the doctrine of St. Paul is analogous to that of the unclean spirits who cried out to Jesus, \"Thou art the Son of God\" (Mark 1:23-26; Mark 3:11; Luke 4:34, 35); and St. Paul's dealing with the spirit of divination was similar to that of our Lord's with the evil spirits in the cases referred to. What was the motive of the damsel, or the spirit by which she was possessed, for so crying out, or St. Paul's for so silencing her, we are not told. Perhaps she interrupted him, and diverted the minds of those to whom he was preaching. And he did not like the mixture of lies with truth. The motive of secrecy which was one cause of our Lord's rebuke to the spirits would not apply in the case of St. Paul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this did she many days.

Command (παραγγέλλω, as in Acts 1:4; Acts 5:28; and ver. 23 of this chapter, etc.). The only other instances of exorcism by St. Paul are these recorded in Acts 19:12 and 15. The question of possession by spirits is too large a one to be discussed here. It must suffice to notice that St. Paul in his action (as our Lord before him had done), and St. Luke in his narrative, distinctly treat possession, and expulsion by the power of Christ, as real.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - But for and, A.V.; gain for gains, A.V. (ἐργασία, as ver. 16); bald hold on for caught, A.V.; dragged for drew, A.V.; before for unto, A.V. The rulers (οἱ ἄρχοντες); the archons. Meyer thinks these were the city judges, or magistrates (who always had their court in the ἀγορά, or forum), by whom Paul and Silas were sent to the praetors (στρατηγοί) for judgment. So in Luke 12:58, the litigants go to the ἀρχών, first, and he sends them on to the κριτής, or judge, who orders them for punishment. This seems a more probable explanation than that commonly adopted (Howson, Alford, Renan, Lewin, etc.), that the ἄρχοντες and the στρατηγοί mean the same officers. No reason can be conceived for Luke's calling them ἄρχοντες if he meant στρατηγοί, or for naming the office's twice over when once was sufficient. Nor is it likely that officers of such high rank as the duumviri, or proctors, as they had come to be called, should be always in the forum, to try every petty case (see articles \"Colonia, Duumviri,\" and \"Praetor,\" in 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities'). It seems, therefore, that Meyer's explanation is right. At Athens the general term ἄρχοντες was applied to inferior magistrates, as well as to the nine archons ('Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities' \"Archon\"). Ver. 20. - When they had brought for brought, A.V.; unto for to, A.V.; they said for saying, A.V. The magistrates; στρατηγοί, i.e. the praetors. Philippi, being a colony, was governed by Roman magistrates called duumviri, corresponding to the two consuls at Rome. But we learn from Cicero that in his time the duuraviri in the colonies were beginning to be called praetors, a little previously used only at Rome ('De Leg. Agrar.,' 34), and to be preceded by lictors (ῤάβδουχαοι of ver. 35). Two inscriptions have been found in which the duumviri of Philippi are mentioned (Lewin, p. 26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Set forth for teach, A.V.; it is for are, A.V.; or for neither, A.V.

Beat them; ῤαβδίζειν, marking that they were beaten by the lictors, or ῤαβδοῦχοι (see ver. 35). The phrase rent ... off (περιῥῤήξαντες) is only found here in the New Testament, but it is frequently used of stripping off garments, in classical Greek and in 2 Macc. 4:38; and by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 6. 14:6) of David rending his garments - a circumstance not mentioned in the Bible narrative (1 Samuel 30:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Cast for thrust, A.V. In the stocks; Greek τὸ ξύλον, sometimes called ξυλοπέδη. The ξύλον was of different forms, and used as a punishment. Sometimes it was a kind of heavy wooden collar put on the neck of a prisoner, whence the phrase, Χύλῳ φιμοῦν τὴν αὐχένα (Aristoph., 'Nubes,' 592),\" To make fast his neck in the pillory.\" Sometimes it was what Aristophanes calls πεντεσύριγγον ξύλον, \"stocks with five holes,\" two for the feet, two for the hands, and one for the neck. Here, as in Job 13:27 (where the LXX. word is ἐν κυλύματι, Hebrew סֵד, a stake, or log), it is simply\" the stocks.\" Thus Paul and Silas, first stripped and 1,catch, then put in the inner prison, and further made fast in the stocks, were treated with the utmost possible rigour and severity. See St. Paul's vivid reminiscence of the outrage (1 Thessalonians 2:2, ὑβρισθέντες).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But about for and at, A.V.; were praying and singing hymns for prayed and sang praises, A.V.; were listening to(imperfect) for heard, A.V. Prayed, etc. Their proseuche was now the dungeon and the sleeks. But, though they were but two, the Lord was in the midst of them, according to his promise, and manifested his gracious presence in the striking deliverance which follows. Were listening to them; ἐπακροάομαι, found only here in the New Testament. But the substantive, ἐπακρόασις, hearkening (\"to hearken,\" A.V.), occurs in the LXX. of 1 Samuel 15:22. What a scene I The dark inner dungeon; the prisoners fast in the stocks, their backs still bleeding and smarting from the stripes; the companionship of criminals and outcasts of society; the midnight hour; and not groans, or curses, or complaints, but joyous trustful songs of praise ringing through the vault! while their companions in the jail listened with astonishment to the heavenly sound in that place of shame wad sorrow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Prison-house for prison, A.V., as Acts 5:21, 23. All the doors were opened. This would be the natural effect of the earthquake. Bands (δεσμά). St. Luke always follows the Attic usage of δεσμόν, in the neuter (romp. Acts 20:23; Luke 8:29). St. Paul follows the Hellenistic usage of δεσμός, in the masculine (Philippians 1:13; see Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 5:5; Habakkuk 3:13). In many instances (genitive and dative) it is, of course, impossible to determine whether the word is masculine or neuter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - The jailor being roused for the keeper of the prison awaking, A.V.; sleep for his sleep, A.V.; drew for he drew out, A.V.; was about to kill for would have killed, A.V.; escaped for been fled, A.V. This readiness to kill himself rather than incur the disgrace of failure in his charge is characteristic of the Roman soldier (comp. Acts 27:43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And he called for lights for then he called for a light, A.V.

Observe that Paul and Silas preached the Word of God's saving health to the penitent and contrite jailor before they thought of having their own smarting wounds washed and dressed. Observe, too, that they spake the Word of life to illuminate his soul before they administered the sacrament of baptism.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Immediately for straightway, A.V. Washed their stripes. Mark the jailor's faith working by love. He and all his. The phrase seems purposely adapted to include family, slaves, and all under his roof. If the conversion of the jailor and his house was sudden, the circumstances which led to it were of unusual power - the earthquake, the loosing of the prisoners' bands, the midnight hour, the words of grace and love and lifo from the apostle's mouth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - He brought them up... and set for when he had brought them... he set, A.V.; rejoiced greatly for rejoiced, A.V. (ἀγαλλιάομαι, a stronger word than χαίρειν, Matthew 5:12; 1 Peter 1:6); with all his house, having believed in God for believing in God with all his house, A.V. The word πανοικί. rendered \"with all his house,\" occurs only here in the New Testament. But it is used by the LXX. in Exodus 1:1 and elsewhere, and by Josephus, etc. The more classical form is πανοικεσίᾳ or πανοικησίᾳ. The A.V. gives the meaning better than the R.V. The faith and the joy were both common to the jailor and his house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - But for and, A.V.

Men that are Romans. We have exactly the same phrase in Acts 22:25, on a similar occasion, where also is the only other example of the word ἀκατάκριτος, uncondemned. Ἄκριτος with a like meaning (\"untried,\" \"without trial\"), is common in classical Greek. The Latin phrase is indicta causa. By the Lex Valeria (A.U.C. 254), \"No quis magistratus civem Romanum adversus provocationem necaret neve verberaret,\" every Roman citizen had a right to appeal (provocare) to the populace against any sentence of death or stripes pronounced by the consuls or any other magistrate; and by the Lex Porcia (A.U.C. 506), no Roman citizen could be scourged. Silas, it appears from the phrase, \"us... men that are Romans,\" was also a civis Romanus. But nothing more is known about it. It does not appear why their exemption as Roman citizens was not made good before; but probably the magistrates refused to listen to any plea in their haste and violence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Reported for told, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - When they had brought them out they asked for brought them out and desired, A.V.; to go away from for to depart out of, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs16:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Departed; i.e. from Philippi, according to the magistrates' request in ver. 39. This is much clearer in the T.R. and A.V. than in the Revised Text and Version, because the same word, ἐξελθεῖν, is used in both places. The R.T. in ver. 39 - ἀπελθεῖν ἀπὸ destroys the reference, and rather suggests that they merely\" went out \"of Lydia's house, which they had \"entered into.\" It appears from the first verse of Acts 17. (\"they had passed,\" etc.) that St. Luke stopped at Philippi, and probably made it his head-quarters till St. Paul's last journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem, some six or seven years later (Acts 20:6). What became of Timothy we are not expressly told, only we find him at Beroea in Acts 17:14 and 1 Thessalonians 3:5; and at Corinth (1 Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1; 1 Thessalonians 3:6). Probably he accompanied St. Paul, but is not named, being still only a subordinate person in the mission.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Amphipolis. This was the ancient capital of that division of Macedonia (Macedonia Prima); see Acts 16:12, note. It was situated on the Via Egnatia, thirty-four miles southwest from Philippi, and three miles from the AEgean Sea. It lay in a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Strymon, whence its name, Amphipolis; its modern name is Neokhoria, now a village. Its original name was Ἐννέα  ῾οδοί, The Nine Ways. Originally a Thracian city, it was conquered by the Athenians, then by the Lacedaemonians, then fell under the dominion of Philip of Macedon, and finally, with the rest of Macedonia, became part of the Roman empire. Apollonia; now probably Polina, thirty miles due west of Amphipolis, on the Via Egnatia. The modern track from Amphipolis to Thessalonica does not pass through Polina, but beneath it. Thessalonica; on the Via Egnatia, now the important seaport of Saloniki, on the Aegean Sea or Archipelago, thirty-eight miles from Apollonia, and con-raining about sixty thousand inhabitants. Its ancient name was Therma (whence the Thermean Bay), but it took the name of Thessalonica under the Macedonian kings. It continued to grow in importance under the Romans, and was the most populous city of the whole of Macedonia. It was the capital of Macedonia Secunda under the division by AEmilius Paulus (Acts 16:12, note), and in the time of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia consisted of two provinces, it was the capital of Macedonia Prima. But from its situation and great commercial importance it was virtually the capital of \"Greece, Macedonia, and Illyricum\" (Howson, in ' Dict. of Geog.'). Its trade attracted a great colony of Jews from before the time of St. Paul, and through the Roman and Greek and Turkish empires, down to the present day, when \"one-half of the population is said to be of Israelitish race \"(Lewin). Thessalonica had a terrible celebrity from the massacre of its inhabitants by order of the Emperor Theodosius, in revenge for the murder of Botheric, his general, which led to the famous penance imposed upon the emperor by St. Ambrose (Gibbon,' Decline and Fall,' Acts 27.). It was also taken three times in the Middle Ages: by the Saracens, with fearful slaughter, A.D. 904; by the Normans, with scarcely less cruelty, A.D. 1185; and by the Turks, in 1430. Its ecclesiastical history under its archbishops is also of great interest (see 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). Where was a synagogue. It is needless to point out the exact agreement of this brief statement with historical fact as pointed out above. There is said to have been twenty-two Jewish synagogues at Thessalonica after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in the fifteenth century, and the number at the present time is stated to be thirty-six. The existence of a synagogue at this time was the reason of St. Paul's visit and sojourn there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Custom for manner, A.V.; for three for three, A.V.; from for out of, A.V.

A.V.; the Christ for Christ, A.V. The line of reasoning adopted by St. Paul in his preaching to the Thessalonian Jews was the same as that of our Lord to the disciples and apostles on the day of his resurrection, as recorded in Luke 24:26, 27; 44-47, and that of St. Peter (Acts 2:22-36; Acts 3:18; Acts 4:11, etc.), and it is irresistible. The fulfillment of prophecies relating to the Messiah in the person of Jesus is like the fitting of a key to the intricate wards of the lock, which proves that it is the right key. The preacher of the gospel should carefully study and expound to the people the word of prophecy, and then show its counterpart in the sufferings and glory of Christ. This did St. Paul. Opening (διανοίγων); as our Lord had done (διήνοιγεν ἡμῖν τὰς γραφάς, Luke 24:32), the hidden meaning of the prophecies, and then alleging (παρατιθέμενος), setting before them the propositions which had thus been established. The process is described in Luke 24:27 as interpreting (\"expounded,\" A.V.). In this verse the opening was showing from the prophets that the Messiah was to die and rise again; the alleging was that Jesus was that very Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Were persuaded for believed, A.V. (ἐπείσθησαν). Consorted with; προσεκληρώθησαν a word only found here in the New Testament, but, like so many other words in St. Luke's vocabulary, found also in Pintarch, in the sense of being \"associated with,\" or \"attached to\" any one; literally, to be assigned to any one by lot (comp. the use of the simple verb ἐκληρώθημεν, Ephesians 1:11). Of the devout Greeks. Observe the frequent proofs of the influence the synagogues had in bringing heathen to the knowledge of the true God (see ver. 12; Acts 10:2; Acts 11:21; Acts 13:48; Acts 14:1, etc.). The chief women (τῶν πρώτων). So in Acts 13:50 τοὺς πρώτους τῆς πολέως means \"the chief men of the city.\" And Lake 19:49, οἱ πρῶτοι τοῦ λαοῦ are \"the chief of the people\" (\" the principal men,\" R.V.) It has been already remarked that St. Lake especially notices the instances of female piety. In ver. 12 we have τῶν εὐσχημόνων in the same sense as the τῶν πρώτων in this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Jews for Jews which believed not, A.V. and T.R.; being moved for moved, A.V.; jealousy for envy, A.V. (see Acts 13:45, note); vile fellows of the rabble for lewd fellows of the baser sort, A.V.; gathering a crowd, set for gathered a company and set, A.V.; the city for all the city, A.V.; assaulting... they for assaulted... and, A.V.; forth for out, A.V. The house of Jason; where it appears from ver. 7, as well as from this verse, Paul and Silas were lodging. If, as is very probable, the Jason here mentioned is the same person as the Jason of Romans 16:21, it would seem that he joined the apostle, either at this time or on his visit to Macedonia mentioned in Acts 20:3, and went with him to Corinth, where the Epistle to the Romans was written. He was a relation, συγγενής, of St. Paul's, and doubtless a Jew. Jason was a Romanized form of the name Jesus, or Joshua, as we see in the case of the high priest, the brother of Chins (Josephus, ' Ant. Jud.,' 12. 5:1). It was borne also by Jason of Cyrene, the Jewish historian (2 Macc. 2:23), and by another mentioned in 1 Macc. 7. 1:17, etc. St. Luke seems to introduce Jason as a well-known person.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Dragged for drew, A.V.; before for unto, A.V. Certain brethren; some of the Thessalonian Christians who happened to be in the house of Jason. The rulers of the city (τοὺς πολιτάρχας, and ver. 8). This is a remarkable instance of St. Luke's accuracy. The word is unknown in Greek literature. But an inscription on an ancient marble arch, still standing in Thessalonica, or Saloniki, records that Thessalonica was governed by seven politarchs (see the inscription in Conybeare and Howson, col. 1. p. 360). Thessalonica was a Greek city, governed by its own laws. Hence the mention of the δῆμος in ver. 5. The polit-archs also were Greek, not Roman, magistrates. Crying; βοῶντες, often followed by μεγάλῃ φωνῇ (Acts 8:7; Mark 15:34, etc.), but whether so followed or not, always meaning \"a loud cry\" or \"shout\" (Acts 21:34; Luke 3:4, etc.). Turned the world upside down; ἀναστατόω is used in the New Testament only by St. Luke and St. Paul (Acts 21:38; Galatians 5:12); to unsettle or disturb; i.e. to make people literally ἀναστάτους homeless, outcasts, from their former settlements, or, metaphorically, unsettled in their allegiance to their civil or spiritual rulers, is the meaning of the word. In the mouth of St. Paul's accusers it contains a distinct charge of sedition and disobedience to the Roman law. The world (τὴν οἰκουμένην the Roman empire (Luke 2:1), viewed as coextensive with the habitable globe (see ver. 31; Acts 19:20; Acts 11:28, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Act for do, A.V.

The insinuation is that, by harboring these seditious men, Jason had made himself a partner in their sedition. That there is another king, etc. (comp.

Beraea. In the third division of Macedonia, about sixty miles from Thessalonica; its modern name is Verria. Went into the synagogue. No amount of ill usage from the Jews could weaken St. Paul's love for \"his brethren, his kinsmen according to the flesh\" (Romans 9:3); and no amount of danger or suffering could check his zeal in preaching the gospel of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now these for these, A.V.; examining for and searched, A.V.; these for those, A.V. Note the immense advantage which the preachers and the hearers had in the previous knowledge of the Scriptures gained by the Beraeans in the synagogue. Note also the mutual light shed by the Old and New Testaments the one upon the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Many... therefore for therefore many, A.V.; the Greek women of honorable estate for honorable women which were Greeks, A.V. Honorable; εὐσχημόνων, as Acts 13:50, where it is coupled with τοὺς πρώτους τῆς πόλεως (see ver. 4; comp. Mark 15:43). Meyer thinks that it is meant that the men were Greeks too; but this is uncertain. The only Beraean convert whose name we know is Sopater (Acts 20:4), or Sosipater, who is probably the same (Romans 16:21). If so, he was apparently a Jew, whose Hebrew name may have been Abishua.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Proclaimed for preached, A.V.; Beraea also for Berea, A.V.; likewise for also, A.V.; stirring up and troubling the multitudes for and stirred up the people, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Forth for away, A.V.; as far as for as it were (ἕως for ὡς), A.V. and T.R.; and for but, A.V. and T.R.; Timothy for Timotheus, A.V. As far as to the sea. If the reading of the T.R. is right, ὡς merely indicates the direction. Literally, ὡς ἐπὶ κ.τ.λ, means \"with the thought of going to the sea,\" but thence, by a common usage, it describes the action without reference to the thought. The English phrase, \"they made for the sea,\" is nearly equivalent. The object of going to the sea, seventeen miles from Beraea, was to take ship for Athens. This he probably did either at Pydna or at Dium. Silas and Timothy. Whether Timothy left Philippi with St. Paul, or whether, as is not improbable, he joined him at Thessalonica, cannot be decided. Anyhow, Paul now left Silas and Timothy to watch over the Thessalonian converts.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - But for and, A.V.; as far as for unto (ἕως), A.V.; Timothy for Timotheus, A.V.; that they should come for for to come, A.V. They that conducted, etc. (οἱ καθιστῶντες). The verb καθίστημι, in its primary sense, means to \"place any one\" in a given spot; and thence secondarily, to \"conduct\" or\" escort\" any one to a place, to \"set him down\" at such a place. So Homer ('Odyssey,' 13:294) uses the word of transporting any one by ship to this or that town (quoted by Meyer). There is the indication in the word of St. Paul's defect of sight or infirmity. Receiving a commandment, etc. We learn here that St. Paul sent a message to Silas and Timothy to join him at Athens as quickly as possible, and at ver. 16 that he waited at Athens for them. From 1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, we learn that he sent Timothy from Athens back to Thessalonica; and from 1 Thessalonians 3:6 we learn that Timothy came to St. Paul at Corinth (where the Epistle to the Thessalonians was written) from Thessalonica. We also learn from 1 Thessalonians 1:1 that Silas and Timothy were both with him at Corinth when he wrote the Epistle, and from Acts 18:5 that they had both come to Corinth from Macedonia, some weeks after Paul himself had been at Corinth (Acts 18:4, 5). All these statements harmonize perfectly (as Paley has shown) on the supposition that Silas and Timothy did join St. Paul at Athens; that for the reasons given in 1 Thessalonians 3, when he was unable to return to Thessalonica himself, as he much wished, he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica, and Silas probably to Beraea; and that Silas and Timothy came together from Macedonia to Corinth, where St. Paul had gone alone; where it may be noted, as another undesigned coincidence, that whereas the First Epistle to the Thessalonians implies that Silas did not go to Thessalonica (1 Thessalonians 3:2), Acts 18:5 does not say that Silas and Timothy came from Thessalonica, but from Macedonia. The inaccuracy supposed by Meyer (on this verse) is purely imaginary. Acts 18:5 does not say that Silas and Timothy \"only joined Paul at Corinth,\" but merely relates some change in St. Paul's procedure consequent upon their joining him at Corinth. Alford (on this verse), in saying that Paul sent Timothy from Beraea, not from Athens, is guided by his own idea of what is probable, not by the letter of the narrative (see further note on Acts 18:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Provoked within for stirred in, A.V. (παρωξύνετο: see Acts 15:29, note); as he beheld for when he saw, A.V.; full of idols for wholly given to idolatry, A.V. The Greek κατείδωλος occurs only here, either in the New Testament or elsewhere. But the analogy of ether words similarly compounded fixes the meaning \"full of idols\" - a description fully borne out by Pausanias and Xenophon and others (Steph., 'Thesaur.;' Meyer, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - So he reasoned for therefore disputed he, A.V.; and the devout for and with the devout, A.V.; market-place every day for market daily, A.V. Reasoned (διελέγετο, as in ver. 2; Acts 18:19 and Acts 24:12). \"Disputed\" gives the force of διαλέγεσθαι better than \"reasoned,\" because the word in Plato, Thucydides, Xenophon, AElian, etc., is especially used of discussions and arguments in which two persons or more take part. Διάλεκτος is \"discussion;\" ἡ διαλεκτίκη is the art of drawing answers from your opponent to prove your conclusion; διάλαγος is a \"dialogue\" (see, however, Acts 20:7). The market-place. \"The celebrated Ἀγορά, ... not far from the Pnyx, the Acropolis, and the Amopagus,... rich in noble statues, the central seat of commercial, forensic, and philosophic intercourse, as well as of the busy idleness of the loungers\" (Meyer, in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him.

The Epicureans (so called from Epicurus, their founder) and the Stoics (so called from the στοά, the colonnade or piazza where Zeno their founder taught) were the most numerous sects at Athens at this time; and their respective tenets were the most opposite to the doctrines of the gospel. Encountered him; σύνεβαλλον. In Acts 4:15 it is followed by πρός, and is properly rendered \"conferred;\" here it is followed by the dative, and may be understood to mean \"disputed\" (συμβάλλειν λόγους). It may, however, not less properly be taken in the sense of a hostile encounter of words, as Luke 14:31, and frequently in classical Greek. This babbler (σπερμολόγος); literally, a picker-up of seeds, applied to a crow (Aristoph., 'Ayes,' 232, 579). Plutarch too ('Demet.,' 28) has σπερμολόγοι ὅρνιθες, birds picking up seeds. Hence it is used of idle hangers-on in the markets, who get a livelihood by what they can pick up, and so generally of empty, worthless fellows. Hence it is further applied to those who pick up scraps of knowledge from one or another and \"babble them indifferently in all companies\" (Johnson's 'Dictionary,' under \"Babble\"). A setter forth of strange gods. There does not seem to be the least ground for Chrysostom's suggestion that they took Anastasis (the Resurrection) for the name of a goddess. But the preaching of Jesus the Son of God, himself risen from the dead (ver. 31), and hereafter to be the Judge of quick and dead at the general resurrection, was naturally, to both Stoics and Epicureans, a setting forth of strange gods. Χένα δαιμόνια are \"foreign deities,\" or \"daemons,\" inferior gods. The word καταγγελεύς, a setter forth, does not occur elsewhere. But the nearly identical word κατάγγελος is used by Plutarch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Took held of for took, A.V.; the Areopagus for Areopagus, A.V.; teaching is for doctrine... is, A.V.; which is spoken by thee for whereof thou speakest, A.V. Took hold of him. The word ἐπιλάβεσθαι means simply to \"take hold of\" the hand, the hair, a garment, etc. The context alone decides whether this taking held is friendly or hostile (for the former sense, see Matthew 14:31; Mark 8:23; Luke 9:47; Luke 14:4; Acts 9:27; Acts 23:19, etc.; for the latter, Luke 23:26; Acts 16:19; Acts 18:17; Acts 21:30, 33). Here the sense is well expressed by Grotius (quoted by Meyer): \"Taking him gently by the hand.\" The Areopagas. Mars' Hill, close to the Agora (\"the market\") on the north, was so called from the legend that Mars was tried there before the gods for the murder of a son of Neptune. It is (says Lewin) a bare, rugged rock, approached at the south-eastern corner by steps, of which sixteen still remain perfect. Its area at the top measures sixty paces by twenty-four, within which a quadrangle, sixteen paces square, is excavated and leveled for the court. The judges seem to have sat on benches tier above tier on the rising rock on the north side of the quadrangle. There were also seats on the east and west sides, and on the south on either side of the stairs. The Areopagus (the upper court) was the most august of all the courts at Athens. Socrates was tried and condemned before it for impiety. On the present occasion, there is no appearance of judicial proceedings, but they seem to have adjourned to the Areopagus from the Agora, as to a convenient place for quiet discussion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Strange things. Χενίζειν, in this use of it, means to act or play the foreigner, to imitate the manners and language and appearance of a foreigner (ξένος), just as Ἰουδαίζειν Ἐλληνίζειν Αττικίζειν, etc., mean to Judaize, Hellenize, Atticize, etc. Here, then, the Athenians say that St. Paul's doctrines have a foreign air, do not look like native Athenian speculations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Now for for, A.V.; the strangers sojourning there for strangers which were there, A.V. Spent their time. This gives the general sense, but the margin of the R.T., had leisure for nothing else, is much more accurate. Αὐκαιρεῖν, which is not considered good Greek, is only used by Polybius, and in the sense either of \"being wealthy\" or of \"having leisure\" or \"opportunity.\" In the New Testament it occurs in Mark 6:31 and 1 Corinthians 16:12. Some new thing. So Cleon (Thucyd., 3:38) rates the Athenians upon their being entirely guided by words, and constantly deceived by any novelty of speech (καινότητος λόγου). And Demosthenes in his first 'Philippic' (p. 43, 7), inveighs against them because, when they ought to be up and doing, they went about the Agora, asking one another, \"Is there any news? (Λέγεταί τι καινόν;).\" The comparative καινότερον ix a little stronger than καινόν: \"the very last news\" (Alford).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And for then, A.V.; the Areopagus for Mars hill, A.V.; in all things I perceive that for I perceive that in all things, A.V.; somewhat for too, A.V. In the midst is simply a local description. He stood in the midst of the excavated quadrangle, while his hearers probably sat on the scats all round. Ye men of Athena. The Demosthenes of the Church uses the identical address - Ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι ( which the great orator used in his stirring political speeches to the Athenian people. Somewhat superstitious. There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether these words imply praise or blame. Chrysostom, followed by many others, takes it as said in the way of encomium, and understands the word δεισιδαιμονεστέρους ασ equivalent to εὐλαβεστέρους, very religious, more than commonly religious. And so Bishop Jacobson ('Speaker's Commentary'), who observes that the substantive δεισδαιμονία is used five times by Josephus, and always in the sense of \"religion,\" or \"piety.\" On the other hand, the Vulgate (superstitiosiores), the English Versions, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, etc., take the word in its most common classical sense of \"superstitious;\" and it weighs for something towards determining St. Luke's use of the word that Plutarch uses δεισιδαιμονία always in a bad sense, of superstition, as in his life of Alexander and elsewhere, and in his tract 'De Superstitione' (Δεισιδαιμονία). Perhaps the conclusion is that St. Paul, having his spirit stirred by seeing the city full of idols, determined to attack that spirit in the Athenian people which led to so much idolatry; which he did in the speech which follows. But, acting with his usual wisdom, he used an inoffensive term at the outset of his speech. He could not mean to praise them for that δεισιδαιμονία which it was the whole object of his sermon to condemn. Josephus ('Contr. Apion.,' 1:12) calls the Athenians τοὺς εὐσεβεστάτους τῶν Ἐλλήνων, the most religious of all Greeks (Howson).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.

AN UNKNOWN GOD. There is no direct and explicit testimony in ancient writers to the existence of any one such altar at Athens, but Pausanias and others speak of altars to \"unknown gods,\" as to be seen in Athens, which may well be understood of several such altars, each dedicated to an unknown god. One of these was seen by St. Paul, and, with inimitable tact, made the text of his sermon. He was not preaching a foreign god to them, but making known to them one whom they had already included in their devotions without knowing him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGod that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The God for God, A.V. (surely a change for the worse); he being Lord for seeing that he is Lord, A.V. Made with hands (χειροποιήτοις); see the same phrase in Mark 14:5, 8; Acts 7:48; Hebrews 9:11. St. Paul applies it, too, to the circumcision made with the knife, as distinguished from that wrought by the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 3:11). It is frequent in the LXX. It is a striking instance of St. Paul's unflinching boldness and fidelity to the truth, that he should expose the hollowness of heathen worship, standing within a stone's throw of the Parthenon and the temple of Theseus and the countless other temples of gods and goddesses, which were the pride and glory of the Athenian people. Note how he begins his catechetical instruction to the Athenians with the first article of the Creed: \"I believe in God the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Is he served by for is worshipped with, A.V.; he himself for he, A.V. Served by men's hands. Θεραπεύεται, is \"waited upon,\" as a man is waited upon by his servant, who ministers to his wants; θεράπων and θεραπευτής are \"an attendant.\" So in Hebrew: עָבַד, to serve God; עָבֵד, a servant of God; עְבודָה service as of the Levites in the temple, etc. Anything; or as some take it, as if he needed anybody's help or service. The argument, as Chrysostom suggests, is similar to that in Psalm 50:8-12.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He made for hath made, A.V.; of one for of one blood, A.V. and T.R.; every nation for all nations, A.V.; having determined their appointed seasons for and hath determined the times before appointed, A.V. From the unity of God Paul deduces the unity of the human race, all created by God, all sprung from one ancestor, or one blood (whichever reading we take), and so not to have their several national gods, but all to be united in the worship of the one true and living God, the Father of them all. It may be remarked by the way that the languages of the earth, differing like the skins and the features of the different races, and corresponding to those various bounds assigned by God to their habitations, yet bear distinct and emphatic testimony to this unity. They are variations, more or less extended, of the speech of man. Bounds of their habitation; τὰς ὀροθεσίας κ.τ.λ.: the word only occurs here; elsewhere, though rarely, τὰ ὀροθέσια.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - God for the Lord, A.V. and T.R. (Meyer does not accept this reading); is for be, A.V.; each for every, A.V. If haply they might feel after him. Ψηλαφάω is \"to touch, feel, or handle,\" as Luke 24:39; Hebrews 12:18; 1 John 1:1. But it is especially used of the action of the blind groping or feeling their way by their hands in default of sight. So Homer describes Polyphemus as χερσὶ ψηλαφόων, feeling his way to the mouth of the cave with his hands after he was blinded by Ulysses ('Odyssey,' 9:416). And in the LXX. of Deuteronomy 28:29 we read, Ἔση ψηλαφῶν μεσημβρίας ὠς εἴ τις ψηλαφήσαι τυφλὸς ἐν τῷ σκότει, \"Thou shall grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness.\" The teaching, therefore, of the passage is that, though God was very near to every man, and had not left himself without abundant witness in his manifold gifts, yet, through the blindness of the heathen, they had to feel their way uncertainly toward God. In this fact lies the need of a revelation, as it follows ver. 30, etc. And hence part at least of the significance of such passages as, \"Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord\" (Ephesians 5:8); \"Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light\" (1 Peter 2:9 ); \"God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ\" (2 Corinthians 4:6), and many more like passages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Even for also, A.V. For in him, etc. This is the proof that we have not far to go to find God, Our very life and being, every movement we make as living persons, is a proof that God is near, nay, more than near, that he is with us and round about us, quickening us with his own life, upholding us by his own power, sustaining the being that we derive from him (comp. Psalm 139:7, etc.; Psalms 23:4). Certain even of your own poets; viz. Arstus of Tarsus (), who has the exact words quoted by St. Paul, and Cleanthes of Asses (), who has Ἐκ σοῦ γὰρ γένος ἐσμέν. As he had just defended himself from the imputation of introducing foreign gods by referring to an Athenian altar, so now, for the same purpose, he quotes one of their own Greek poets. (For the statement that man is the offspring of God, comp. Luke 3:38.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Being then for forasmuch then as we are, A.V.; device of man for man's device, A.V. Graven by art, etc. In the Greek the substantive χαράγματα, graven images, things engraven, is in apposition with the gold, silver, and stone, and a further description of them. Art, τέχνη, is the manual skill, the device; ἐνθύμησις is the genius and mental power which plans the splendid temple, or exquisite sculpture, or the statue which is to receive the adoration of the idolater. Compare the withering sarcasm of Isaiah (Isaiah 44:9-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked for and the times of this ignorance God winked at, A.V.; he commandeth for commandeth, A.V.; men for all men, A.V.; that they should all everywhere repent for everywhere to repent, A.V. and T.R. The times of ignorance; perhaps with reference to ver. 23, and also implying that all the idolatry, of which he had spoken in ver. 29, arose from ignorance. God overlooked; or, as it is idiomatically expressed in the A.V., winked at; made as if he did not see it; \"kept silence,\" as it is said in Psalm 50:21; made no move to punish it. That they should all everywhere. The gospel is for the whole world- \"Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world\" (Romans 10:18); \"Preach the gospel to every creature\" (Mark 16:15). Repent.

He hath appointed a day. Hitherto the Athenians seem to have listened with interest while St. Paul was, with consummate skill, leading them onwards from the doctrines of natural religion, and while he was laying down speculative truths. But now they are brought to a stand. They might no longer go on asking, Τι καινόν; A day fixed by God, they were told, was at hand, in which God would judge the world in righteousness, and in which they themselves would be judged also. And the certainty of this was made apparent by the fact that he who was ordained to be Judge was raised from the dead, and so ready to commence the judgment. The time for immediate action was come; God's revelation had reached them. The man (ἀνδρί). So Acts 2:22, Ἰησοῦν τὸν Ναζωραῖον ἄνδρα ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀποδεδειγμένον κ.τ.λ. And so in John 5:27 our Lord himself says of himself that the Father gave him authority to execute judgment \"because he is the Son of man;\" and in Matthew 26:24, \"Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power.\" (For the connection of the judgment with Christ's resurrection, see especially Acts 10:40-42.)

Some mocked. Athenian skepticism could not accept so spiritual a truth as the resurrection of the dead; and Athenian levity of purpose deferred to another day the decisive step of accepting the salvation of the risen Savior, just as it had deferred resistance to Philip of Macedon till their liberties were gone and their country enslaved.

At ver. 22 we were told that he stood ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἀρείου πάγου (where see note); now he went out ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν, leaving them still sitting on their benches, while he walked down the steps to the city again from the place where he stood.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs17:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - But for howbeit, A.V.; whom also for the which, A.V. Dionysius the Areopagite. The earliest notice we have of him in ecclesiastical writers is the well-known one of Eusebius, 'Eccl. Hist.,' 3. 4, in which he says, \"We are told by an ancient writer, Dionysius the pastor of the diocese of Corinth (ob. ), that his namesake Dionysius the Areopagite, of whom St. Luke says in the Acts that he was the first who embraced the faith after St. Paul's discourse in the Areopagus, became the first bishop of the Church in Athens.\" Eusebius repeats the statement in his long notice of Dionysius of Corinth, in 4. 23. Other uncertain traditions speak of him (Suidas) as one who rose to the height of Greek erudition, and as having suffered a cruel martyrdom (Niceph., 3:11). \"The works which go by his name are undoubtedly spurious\" (Alford). Damaris; \"wholly unknown\" (Meyer), but certainly not the wife of Dionysius, as Chrysostom (' De Sacerd.,' 4:7) and others have thought ('Dictionary of the Bible'). And others with them. These would seem to be but few from St. Luke's way of mentioning them, and from our hearing nothing more in the Acts about the Church at Athens. It is remarkable that this small number of converts coincides with the weakness of the synagogue at Athens - too weak to persecute, and too weak to make proselytes among the Greeks of Athens. It scorns clear that nowhere else had St. Paul won so few souls to Christ. And yet God's Word did not return to him wholly void. The seed fell on some good ground, to bring forth fruit unto eternal life.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.18":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - He for Paul, A.V. and T.R. After these things, etc. No hint is given by St. Luke as to the length of Paul's sojourn at Athens. But as the double journey of the Beroeans, who accompanied him to Athens, back to Beraea, and of Timothy from Beraea to Athens, amounted to above five hundred miles (Lewin, p. 268), we cannot suppose it to have been less than a month; and it may have been a good deal more. His reasonings in the synagogue with the Jews and devout Greeks, apparently on successive sabbaths, his daily disputations in the Agora, apparently not begun till after he had \"waited\" some time for Silas and Timothy, the knowledge he had acquired of the numerous temples and altars at Athens, and the phrase with which this chapter begins, all indicate a stay of some length. Came to Corinth. If by land, a forty miles' or two days' journey, through Eleusis and Megara; if by sea, a day's sail. Lewin thinks he came by sea, and that it was in winter, and that possibly one of the shipwrecks mentioned in 2 Corinthians 11:25 may have occurred at this time. Corinth, at this time a Roman colony, the capital of the province of Achaia, and the residence of the proconsul. It was a great commercial city, the center of the trade of the Levant, and consequently a great resort of the Jews. It had a very large Greek population. Ancient Corinth had been destroyed by Mummins, surnamed Achaicus, R.C. 146, and remained waste (ἐρήμη) many years. Julius Caesar founded a Roman colony on the old site (Howson), \"consisting principally of freedmen, among whom were great numbers of the Jewish race.\" Corinth, as a Roman colony, had its duumviri, as appears by coins of the reign of Claudius (Lewin, p. 270.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He found for found, A.V.; a man of Pontus by race for born in Pontus, A.V.; because for because that, A.V.; the Jews for ,[ewe, A.V.: he came for came, A.V. Aquila. A Roman name, Graecized into Ἀκύλας. Knights and tribunes and others of the name occur in Roman history. Whether the Jewish family residing in Pontus took the name of Aquila from any of these Romans is not known. Aquila, the translator of the Old Testament into Greek about A.D. , was also a Jew of Pontus, the old kingdom of Mithridates. That there was a considerable colony of Jews in Pontus appears also from 1 Peter 1:1 and Acts 2:9. Priscilla. Also called Prison (2 Timothy 4:19). So in classical authors, Livia and Livilla, Drusa and Drusilla, are used of the same persons (Howson, p. 415). Prisca is a not uncommon name for Roman women. The masculine Priscus occurs very frequently. Aquila and Priscilla were among the most active Christians, and the most devoted friends of St. Paul (vers. 18, 26; Romans 16:3, 4, 5; 1 Corinthians 16:19; 2 Timothy 4:19); and were evidently persons of culture as well as piety. Lately; προσφάτως (i.q. πρόσφατον, Pindar, etc.), only found here in the New Testament. But it occurs in the LXX. of Deuteronomy 24:5 and Ezekiel 11:3, and in the apocryphal books repeatedly, and in Polybius. The adjective πρόσφατος, which is also used by the LXX. and the Apocrypha and in classical Greek for \"new,\" is used only once in the New Testament, in Hebrews 10:20. It means properly \"newly killed,\" hence anything \"recent,\" \"fresh, or \"new.\" Both the adjective and the adverb are very common in medical writings. Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome. Suetonius mentions the fact, but unfortunately does not say in what year of Claudius's reign it took place. His account is that, in consequence of frequent disturbances and riots among the Jews at the instigation of Chrestus, Claudius drove them from Rome. It seems almost certain, as Renan says, especially combining Tacitus's account ('Annal.,' 15:44) of the spread of Christianity in the city of Rome before the time of Nero, that Chrestus (Greek Ξρηστός,) is only a corruption of the name Christ, similar to that found on three or four inscriptions before the time of Constantine, where Christians are called Ξρηστιανοί, and to the formation of the French word Chretien - in old French Chrestien; and that the true account of these riots is that they were attacks of the unbelieving Jews upon Christian Jews, similar to these at Jerusalem (Acts 8.), at Antioch in Pisidia (Acts 13:50), at Iconium and Lystra (Acts 14.), and at Thessalonica and Beraea (Acts 17.). The Romans did not discriminate between Jews and Christian Jews, and thought that those who called Christ their King were fighting under his leadership (comp. Acts 17:7; Luke 23:2; see Renan, 'St. Paul,' p. 101). Tertullian and Lactantius (quoted by Lewin, p. 274) both speak of the vulgar pronunciation, Chres-tianus and Chrestus. Howson also adopts the above explanation. But Meyer thinks that Chrestus was, as Suetonius says, a Jewish leader of insurrection at Rome. The question bears on the passage before us chiefly as the solution does or does not prove the existence of Christians at Rome at this time, and affects the probability of Aquila and Priscilla being already Christians when they came to Corinth, before they made St. Paul's acquaintance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Trade for craft, A.V.; they wrought for (he) wrought, A.V. and T.R.; trade for occupation, A.V.

Tent-makers; σκηνοποιοί, which is paraphrased by σκηοῥῤάφοι, tent-stitchers or tailors, by Chrysostom and Theodoret. Hug and others erroneously interpret it \"makers of tent-cloth,\" from the fact that a certain kind of cloth made of goats' hair, called κιλίκιον, was manufactured in Paul's native country of Cilicia. But the fact of such manufacture would equally lead persons who were living in Cilicia to exercise the trade of making tents of the cloth so manufactured. St. Paul alludes to his manual labor in Acts 20:33-35; 1 Corinthians 4:12; 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, 9.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Jews and Greeks for the Jews and the Greeks, A.V.

When Silas and Timothy, etc. It is probable that Silas had returned by St. Paul's directions to Beraea, and Timothy to Thessalonica from Athens. If there were extant a letter of Paul to the Beraeans, it would probably mention his sending back Silas to them, just as the Epistle to the Thessalonians mentions his sending Timothy to them. Now they both come to Corinth from Macedonia, which includes Beraea and Thessalonica. If they came by sea, they would probably sail together from Dium to Cenchreae (see Acts 17:14, note). Was constrained by the Word. As an English phrase, this is almost destitute of meaning. If the R.T. is right, and it has very strong manuscript authority, the words συνείχετο τῷ λόγῳ mean that he was seized, taken possession of, and as it were bound by the necessity of preaching the Word, constrained as it were to preach more earnestly than ever. In St. Luke συνέχεσθαι is a medical term: in Luke 4:28, R.T., \"Holden with a great fever;\" Luke 8:37, \"Holden with a great fear;\" Acts 28:8, \"Sick of fever and dysentery;\" and so frequently in medical writers ('Medical Language of St. Luke,' Hobart). But it is worth considering whether συνείχετο is not in the middle voice, with the sense belonging to συνεχής, i.e. \"continuous,\" \"unbroken,\" and so that the phrase means that, after the arrival of Silas and Timothy, St. Paul gave himself up to continuous preaching. St. Luke has not infrequently a use of words peculiar to himself. The Vulgate rendering, instabat verbo, seems so to understand it. It was probably soon after the arrival of Silas and Timothy that St. Paul wrote his First Epistle to the Thessalonians (1 Thessalonians 1:1; 1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, 6). The Second Epistle followed some time before St. Paul left Corinth. If the T.R., τῷ πνεύματι, is right, it must be construed, \"constrained by the Spirit,\" in accordance with Greek usage. Testifying, etc. Note how different St. Paul's preaching in the synagogue was from his preaching in the Areopagus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Shook out for shook, A.V. For this action of shaking his raiment, comp. Acts 13:51. It was in accordance with our Lord's direction in Matthew 10:14, where the same word (ἐκτινάσσειν) is used. It is \"much employed in medical language\" (Hobart, ' Medical Language of St. Luke,' p. 240). The idea seems to be having nothing henceforth in common with them. Your blood, etc. (see Ezekiel 33:4-9). St. Paul's keen sense of the perverseness of the Jews breaks out in his First Epistle to the Thessalonians (it. 14-16), written about this time.

Thence. Clearly from the synagogue, where he had been preaching to the Jews, not from Aquila's house, as Alford and others. It does not appear to be a question here of where Paul lodged, but where he preached. Justus had probably a large room, which he gave Paul the use of for his sabbath and other meetings. As Howson truly says, he continued to \"lodge\" (μένειν) with Aquila and Priscilla. It is only said that he \"came\" (ῆλθεν) to the house of Justus from the synagogue. So Renan, \"Il enseigna desor-mais dans la maison de Titius Justus\" (p. 216). One that worshipped God (σεβομένον τὸν Θεόν); i.e. a Greek proselyte of the gate (see Acts 13:43, 50; Acts 16:14; Acts 17:4, 17, etc.) Cornelius is called εὐσεβὴς καὶ φοβούμενος τὸν Θεόν. Whose house, etc. Either his proximity to the synagogue had led to his attending there, or, being already a proselyte, he had taken a house hard by for the convenience of attending.

With all his house (comp. Acts 16:33, 34). Many of the Corinthians; i.e. of the Greeks and Romans, who composed the population of the city. It is seldom that we have the names of so many converts preserved as we have of this Achaian mission. Besides Crispus and Gaius, we know of Epaenetus and Stephanas, who would seem to have been converted together (Romans 16:5; 1 Corinthians 16:15); and probably also Fortunatus and Achaicus (1 Corinthians 16:17). Gains, from his name (Caius) and his salutation to the Church at Rome, was probably a Roman. Fortunatus and Achaicus also be-belonged, perhaps, to the Roman colony. Here too were many heathen converts (1 Corinthians 12:2), though mostly of the lower rank (1 Corinthians 1:26-29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And the Lord said unto for then spake the Lord to, A.V.

But more commonly of a \"vision,\" as in Acts 9:10, 12; Acts 10:3, 17, 19; Acts 11:5; Acts 12:9; Acts 16:9. So in the LXX. (Genesis 46:2, etc.). St. Paul received a similar gracious token of the Lord's watchful care of him soon after his conversion (Acts 22:17-21). He tells us that then he was in an \"ecstasy,\" or trance. The ἔκστασις describes the mental condition of the person who sees an ὅραμαα.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Harm for hurt, A.V.

For the encouraging promise of protection in the midst of danger given to St. Paul by Christ in this vision, comp.

Dwelt; literally, sat down, as Acts 13:14, etc., and hence to \"remain quietly\" (Luke 24:49). A year and six months. It is not clear whether these eighteen months are to be measured to the end of St. Paul's stay at Corinth, or only to the rising up of the Jews related in vers. 12-17. Renan is doubtful. Howson does not go into the question. But Lewin rightly measures the eighteen months down to Gallio's arrival. And so does Meyer, who also notices the force of ἐκάθισε, as indicating a quiet, undisturbed abode, and calls special attention to the ἔτι of ver. 18, as showing that the \"many days\" there mentioned were additional to the year and a half of ver. 11. The only longer residence we know of was that of three years at Ephesus (Acts 20:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - But for and, A.V.; proconsul for the deputy, A.V.; with one accord rose up for made insurrection with one accord, A.V.; before for to, A.V. Gallio. Marcus Annaeus Novatus took the name of Lucius Junius Annaeus Gallio, on account of his adoption by L. Junius Gallio. He was the elder brother of Seneca, and a man of ability, and of a most amiable temper and disposition. His brother Seneca said that he had not a fault, and that everybody loved him. He was called \"Dulcis Gallio\" by Statius. It is unfortunately not known exactly in what year Gallio became either Consul or Proconsul of Achaia. Had it been known, it would have been invaluable for fixing the chronology of St. Paul's life. Lewin puts it (his proconsulate) in the year A.D. , and so does Renan; Howson, between A.D. and A.D. . The circumstantial evidence from secular writers corroborating St. Luke's account is exceedingly curious. There is no account extant either of his consulate or of his proconsulate of Achaia. But Pithy, speaking of the medicinal effect of a sea-voyage on persons in consumption, gives as an example, \"as I remember was the case with Annaeus Gallio after his consulate,\" and seems to imply that he went to Egypt for the sake of the long sea-voyage; which would suit very well his going there from his government in Achaia (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 31. cap. 6:33). And that his proconsulate was in Achaia is corroborated by a chance quotation in Seneca's Epistle 104, of a saying of \"my lord Gallio, when ha had a fever in Achaia and immediately went on board ship,\" where the phrase \"domini met,\" applied to his own brother, seems also to indicate his high rank. Profane history also shuts up the probable date of Gallio's proconsulate between the year A.D. and the year A.D. or 66, in which he died. There is a diversity of accounts as to his death. Ernesti, in his note on Tacitus, 'Auual.,' 15. 73, where Tacitus speaks of him as frightened at the death of his brother Seneca, and a suppliant for his own life, says, \"quem Nero post interfecit,\" and refers to Dion Cassius, 58,18, and Eusebius. But Dion is there speaking of Junius Gallio in the reign of Tiberius, not of our Gallio at all; though afterwards, speaking of the death of Seneca, he says, \"and his brothers also were killed after him \"(62, 25). As for Eusebius, the passage quoted is not found in the Greek or Armenian copies of the 'Chronicon,' but only in the Latin of Jerome. But, as Scaliger points out, there is a manifest blunder here, because the 'Chronicon ' places the death of Gallio two years before that of Seneca, whereas we know from Tacitus that Gallio was alive after his brother's death. Moreover, the description \"egregius declamator\" clearly applies to Junius Gallio the rhetorician, and not to Gallio his adopted son. Though, therefore, Renan says, \"Comme son frere il eut l'honneur sous Neron d'expier par, la mort sa distinction et son honnetete\" ('St. Paul,' p. 222), if we give duo weight to the silence of Tacitus, it is very doubtful whether he died a violent death at all. St. Luke, as usual, is most accurate in calling him proconsul. Achaia had been recently made a senatorial province by Claudius. For ἀνθύπατος, see Acts 13:7, 8, 12; Acts 19:38. The verb occurs only here in the New Testament. The term deputy was adopted in the A.V. doubtless from that being the title of the Viceroy of Ireland, and other officers who exercise a deputed authority, just as the proconsul was in the place of the consul. Rose up against; κατεπέστησαν, one of Luke's peculiar words, found neither in the New Testament nor in the LXX., nor in classical writers (Steph., 'Thesaur.').

Contrary to the Law; meaning, as it naturally would in the mouth of a Jew, the Law of Moses. Hence Gallio's answer in ver. 15, \"If it be a question... of your Law, look ye to it.\" The very phrase, to \"worship God,\" had a technical sense (see above, ver. 7). Paul, they said, professed to make proselytes, and encouraged them to break the Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - But for and, A.V.; about for now about, A.V.; if indeed for if, A.V.; of wicked villainy for wicked lewdness, A.V.

But it is used by Demosthenes and Plutarch in exactly the same connection: ἀπὸ τοῦ συνεδρίου ἀπὸ τοῦ βήματος (Demosthenes, 1373,12; Plutarch, ' Marcell.,' p. 410, in Schleusner). It implies the ignominious dismissal of the case, without its being even tried. The judgment seat (βῆμα); the proconsular place of judgment. The βῆμα (here and ver. 12) was properly the \"raised space,\" or \"tribune,\" on which, in the case of a consul, proconsul, or praetor, the sella curulis was placed on which he sat and gave judgment. It was usually a kind of apse to the basilica. In Matthew 27:19; John 19:13, and, indeed, here and elsewhere, it seems to be used, generally, for the judgment-seat itself (see Acts 25:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat.

The R.T. has far more manuscript support than either the T.R. or another reading, which has \"Jews\" instead of \"Greeks.\" All means all the crowd of bystanders and lookers-on, mostly, no doubt, Greeks. The Jews, always unpopular, would be sure to have the Corinthian rabble against them as soon as the proconsul drove them from the judgment seat. Sosthenes. There is no probability whatever that he is the same person as the Sosthenes of 1 Corinthians 1:1. The name was very common. He appears to have succeeded Crispus as ruler of the synagogue, and would be likely, therefore, to be especially hostile to Paul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Having tarried after this yet many days for after this tarried there yet a good while, and then, A.V.; for for into, A.V.; Cenchreae for Cenchrea, A.V. Took his leave; ἀποταξάμενος, here and again in ver. 21. This is a somewhat peculiar use of the word, which occurs also in Luke 9:61 and 2 Corinthians 2:13 (see too Mark 6:46). It is used in the same sense in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11. 8:6). In a metaphorical sense it means\" to renounce,\" \"to bid adieu to\" (Luke 14:23). Of the six times it occurs in the New Testament, four are in St. Luke's writings and one in St. Paul's. With him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae, etc. There is great diversity of opinion as to whether it was St. Paul or Aquila who had the vow. Meyer thinks that the mention of Priscilla before Aquila, contrary to the order in ver. 2 and in ver. 26 (where, however, the R.T. reads \"Priscilla and Aquila), is a clear indication that Luke meant the words κειράμενος κ.τ.λ., to refer to Aquila, not to St. Paul, and Howson takes the same view. But this is a very weak argument, refuted at once by Romans 16:3 and 2 Timothy 4:19, as well as by the whole run of the passage, in which Paul is throughout the person spoken of; or, as Alford puts it, in the consecutive narrative from ver. 18 to ver. 25, there are nine aorist participles, of which eight apply to Paul, as the subject of the section, making it scarcely doubtful that the ninth applies to him likewise. Moreover, there is no conceivable reason why the vow should be mentioned if it was taken by Aquila, and, what is still more conclusive, the person who went to Jerusalem, i.e. Paul, must be the one who had the vow, not the person who stayed behind, i.e. Aquila. In fact, nobody would ever have thought of making Aquila the subject if it were not for the thought that there is an incongruity with Paul's character in his making a vow of that kind. But we must take what we find in Scripture, and not force it to speak our own thoughts. As regards the nature of the vow, it is not quite clear what it was. It was not the simple Nazaritic vow described in Numbers 6:18-21; nor is the word here used by St. Luke (κειράμενος) the one which is there and elsewhere employed by the LXX., and by St. Luke himself in Acts 21:24, of that final shaving of the hair of the Nazarite for the purpose of offering it at the door of the tabernacle (ξυράω). It seems rather to have been of the nature of that vow which Josephus speaks of as customary for persons in any affliction, viz. to make a vow that, for thirty days previous to that on which they intend to offer sacrifice, they will abstain from wine and will shave off (ξυρήσασθαι) their hair, adding that Bernice was now at Jerusalem in order to perform such a vow ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 15:1). But it further appears, from certain passages in the Mishna, that, if any one had a Nazarite vow upon him outside the limits of the Holy Land, he could not fulfill such vow till he was come to the Holy Laud, to Jerusalem; but it was allowable in such case to cut his hair short (κείρεσθαι τὴν κεφαλήν), and as some say to take it with him to Jerusalem, and there offer it at the same time that he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head (ξυρήσασθαι). It would seem, therefore, that either in a severe illness or under some great danger (ἀνάγκη) St. Paul had made such a vow; that he had been unwilling to cut his hair short at Corinth, where he was thrown so much into the society of Greeks, and therefore did so at Cenchreae just before he embarked for Syria; and that he made all haste to reach Jerusalem in time for the Passover, that he might there accomplish his vow (see Bishop Wordsworth's note on Acts 18:18; and Farrar's ' Life of St. Paul,' 2. p. 2). His motives for the vow may have been partly those described on another occasion (Acts 21:24), and partly his own Jewish feelings of piety showing themselves in the accustomed way. Cenchreae. The eastern port of Corinth; a considerable place. There was a Church there, doubtless founded by St. Paul during his stay at Corinth (Romans 16:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They came for he came, A.V. and T.R.; he left for left, A.V.

They were the capitals of the two flourishing and peaceful provinces of Achaia and Asia, and the two great mercantile towns on opposite sides of the sea\" (Howson, vol. 1:454). The voyage would take from ten to fifteen days. Reasoned; διελέχθη, as in Acts 17:2, 17; ver. 4, 19:8,9; 20:7, 9; 24:25. As regards the expression, left them there, it probably arises from some actual detail which made it the natural one to use. If, for example, the synagogue was just outside the city, and Paul, parting with Aquila and Priscilla in the city, had gone off immediately to the synagogue, the phrase used would be the natural one; or the words, \"he left them there,\" may be spoken with reference to the main narrative, which is momentarily interrupted by the mention of St. Paul's visit to the synagogue. Note the extreme importance of this brief visit to Ephesus, where the foundation of a vigorous and flourishing Church seems to have been laid. He who knows \"the times and the seasons\" sent St. Paul there now, though two years before he had forbidden him to go to Asia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And when they asked for when they desired, A.V.; abide a for tarry, A.V.; time for time with them, A.V.

Taking his leave; as in ver. 18, note. I must by all means, etc. This clause is not found in א, A, B, E, and several versions, and is omitted in the R.T. But Alford, Meyer, Wordsworth, and others consider it to be genuine. It is certainly difficult to account for such words being inserted in the text if they were not genuine; whereas it is easy to account for their omission, either by accident or from the fact that the brevity of the allusion to his visit to Jerusalem in ver. 22 might easily mislead a copyist into thinking that St. Paul did not go to Jerusalem at this time, and therefore that the words were misplaced. Observe how St. Paul's fixed purpose to reach Jerusalem as soon as possible tallies with the account of his vow. This feast (A.V.). It is not clear what feast is meant. Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary,' and others, following Wieseler, think it was the Feast of Pentecost, being influenced by the consideration that sailing was dangerous and very unusual so early as before the Passover. But Meyer thinks it uncertain. But the expression, \"I must by all means,\" would cover the risk of a voyage in the stormy season. I will return again. The fulfillment of this promise is related in Acts 19:1, etc. If God will (see James 4:13-15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - He went up for and gone up, A. g.; and went for he went, A.V.

It was also the harbor by which all travelers from the West approached it, and from whence roads led to Egypt on the south, to Tyre and Sidon and Antioch on the north, and eastward to Nablous and Jerusalem and the Jordan\" (Howson, 1:455). He went up and saluted the Church; meaning, without any doubt, he went up to Jerusalem, as both the word ἀναβὰς, and the object of his-going up, \"to salute the Church,\" conclusively show. For ἀναβαίνω, whether coupled with εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα as in Matthew 20:17, 18, or standing alone as in John 7:8, 10, and John 12:20, is the regular word for going up to Jerusalem (see Acts 11:2; Acts 15:2; Acts 21:12, 15; Acts 24:11; Acts 25:1, 9); and ἡ ἐκκλησία, the Church, which Paul went to salute, can mean nothing but the mother Church of Jerusalem. No doubt he was received officially by the apostles, represented by James and the elders and the Church, as in Acts 15:4; and gave a formal account of the result of his second missionary journey, and of the great event of the introduction of the gospel into Macedonia and Achaia. It is a remarkable example of St. Luke's great brevity at times that this is the only notice of his arrival at Jerusalem, where his vow was to be fulfilled. Went down to Antioch; from whence he had started with Silas, after his separation from Barnabas, some three years before, \"being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God\" (Acts 16:40; comp. Acts 14:26, 27; Acts 15:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Having for after he had, A.V.; through the region for over all the country, A.V.; stablishing for strengthening, A.V. Having spent some time there (Acts 15:33, note). How long we have no means of knowing; probably under six months; \"quelques mois\" (Renan, pp. 329,330 ); \"four months\" (Lewin, 1:370, note; camp. 1 Car. 16:6, 7; Acts 19:22). According to Renan, Lewin, 'Speaker's Commentary,' and many others, it was at this time that the meeting with St. Peter occurred to which St. Paul refers in Galatians 2:11, etc. And Renan ingeniously connects that perversion of the faith of the Galatians which led to St. Paul's Epistle being addressed to them, with the visit to Antioch of James's emissaries, Lewin also identifies the journey of St Paul to Jerusalem mentioned in Galatians 2:1 with that recorded in our ver. 22. But neither of these theories is borne out by any known facts, nor is in itself probable. There is no appearance of Barnabas or Titus being with St. Paul at this time, and it is very unlikely that any should have come from James to Antioch so immediately after St. Paul's salutation of the Church at Jerusalem and the fulfillment of his vow there. The time preceding the visit of Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, as related in Acts 15, is far the most likely for the encounter of the two apostles (see Acts 14:28; Acts 15:1, and note). Went through; διερχόμενος, as in Acts 8:4, 40; Acts 10:38; Acts 13:6; Acts 16:6; Acts 17:23, etc. The region of Galatia and Phrygia. In Acts 16:6 the order is inverted, \"the region of Phrygia and Galatia,\" R.V., or \"Phrygia and the region of Galatia,\" A.V. The natural inference from this is, as Lewin says, with whom Farrar agrees, that on this occasion St. Paul went straight from Antioch to Galatia, passing through the Cilician Gates and by Mazaca, or Caesarea, as it was called by Tiberius Caesar, in Cappadocia, and not visiting the Churches of Lycaonia. He proceeded from Galatia through Phrygia to Ephesus. The distance from Antioch to Tarsus was one hundred and forty-one miles, from whence to Tavium in Galatia was two hundred and seventy-one miles, making the whole distance from Antioch to Tavium in Galatia four hundred and twelve miles, or about a three weeks' journey including rest on the sabbath days. From Galatia to Ephesus would be between six hundred and seven hundred miles. The entire journey would thus be considerably more than a thousand miles, a journey of forty days exclusive of all stoppages. Six months probably must have elapsed between his departure from Antioch and his arrival at Ephesus; Lewin says \"several months\" (p. 330, note). In order; in the same order, though inverted, in which he had first visited them, leaving out none.

(λόγιος); came to Ephesus; and he was mighty, etc., for and mighty in the Scriptures, came, etc., A.V. From ver. 24 to ver. 28 is a distinct episode, and an important one, as containing the first mention of a very remarkable man, Apollos (a short form of Apollonius, like Epaphras for Epaphroditus) of Alexandria, a city destined to play a conspicuous part in Church history, as the traditional Church and see of St. Mark, the school of the Neoplatonists, the scene of the labors of Origen, Clement, and many other men of note, and the birthplace of the Gnostic leaders Cerinthus, Basilides, and Valentinus. The notices of Apollos in the New Testament are Acts 19:1; 1 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Corinthians 3:4, 5, 6, 22; 1 Corinthians 4:6; 1 Corinthians 16:12; Titus 3:13; and all show St. Paul's high esteem for him. It was no more his fault than St. Peter's and St. Paul's that the factious Corinthians elevated him, or rather degraded him, into the leader of a party, Eloquent seems to be a better translation of λόγιος here than learned. The Greek word, which only occurs here in the New Testament, has both meanings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - Had been for was, A.V.; spirit for the spirit, A.V.; carefully for diligently, A.V.; things concerning Jesus for things of the Lord, A.V. and T.R.; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him for whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, A.V. and T.R.; carefully for perfectly, A.V. Knowing only the baptism of John. It is difficult at first sight to conceive how at this time any one could know the baptism of John without knowing further that of Christ. But a possible account of it is that Apollos living at Alexandria, where as yet there was no Christian Church. had met some Jews who had been in Judaea at the time of John's ministry, and had heard from them of John's baptism and preaching, and of his testimony to Jesus as the Messiah, but had had no further opportunity of careful instruction in the faith of Jesus Christ till he happened to come to Ephesus and make the acquaintance of his compatriots, Aquila and Priscilla. They hearing him speak with fervor and eloquence, but perceiving that his knowledge was imperfect, immediately invited him to their house, and instructed him in the fullness of the truth of the gospel. This necessarily included the doctrine of Christian baptism, which we cannot doubt was administered to him (John 1:33; Acts 1:5; Acts 2:38).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Minded for disposed, A.V.; pass over for pass, A.V.; encouraged him, and wrote to for wrote exhorting, A.V.; and... he helped for who... helped, A.V. To pass over into Achaia. Nothing can be more natural than the course of events here described. In his intimate intercourse with Priscilla and Aquila, Apollos had necessarily heard much of the great work at Corinth, and the flourishing Church there; and so he longed to see for himself and to exercise his powers in watering what St. Paul had so well planted (1 Corinthians 3:6). Priscilla and Aquila having heard his eloquent sermons at Ephesus, and being interested in the Corinthian Church, seem to have encouraged him, and to have joined with the other disciples at Ephesus in giving him commendatory letters to the Church of Corinth. Encouraged him; προτρεψάμενοι, a word found nowhere else in the New Testament, but used in classical Greek and in the Apocrypha, in the sense of \"exhorting,\" \"urging.\" Προτρεπτικοὶ λόγοι are hortatory words. In medical writers a \"stimulant\" is προτρεπτικόν. There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether the exhortation was addressed to Apollos, as the R.V. takes it, or to the brethren at Corinth, as the A.V. understands it. It seems rather more consonant to the structure of the sentence and to the probability of the case that the exhortation was addressed to the Corinthian Church, and not to Apollos, who needed no such encouragement, Προτρεψάμενοι ἔγραψαν is equivalent to \"wrote and exhorted.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs18:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Powerfully confuted for mightily convinced, A.V.; the Christ for Christ, A.V. Powerfully confuted; διακατηλέγχετο, one of St. Luke's peculiar compounds, found nowhere else; εὐτόνως here and Luke 23:10 (vehemently), but nowhere else in the New Testament. The adjective εὔτονος, meaning \"nervous,\" \"vehement,\" and the adverb εὐτόνως, meaning \"vigorously,\" \"with force,\" are very frequent in medical writers; εὐτόνως is also found in the LXX. of Joshua 6:7, Σημαινέτωσαν εὐτόνως, \"Let them blow a loud blast.\" Showing by the Scriptures, etc. The same line of preaching as St. Peter and St. Paul always adopted when address-lug Jews (see Acts 2; Acts 13; Acts 17:3; Acts 18:5, etc.). It is remarkable that the success of Apollos at Corinth seems to have been chiefly among the Jews, who had opposed themselves so vehemently to St. Paul (ver. 6). It is one of the many proofs of the singleness of eye and simplicity of purpose of the great apostle, that the success of this novice where he himself had failed did not excite the least jealousy (1 Corinthians 16:12). St. Luke, too, Paul's friend and biographer, here speaks of the powers and work of Apollos with no stinted measure of praise.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.19":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Country for coasts, A.V.; found for finding, A.V. and T.R.

Did ye receive, etc.? The R.V. gives the sense much more accurately than the A.V., which is, \"Did ye receive the Holy Ghost at the time of your baptism, when ye first believed?\" Something led the apostle to suspect that they had not received the seal of the Spirit (comp. Ephesians 1:13, πιστεύσαντες ἐσφραγίσθητε), and so he asked the question. The answer, Nay, we did, not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given, as in the R.V., is justified by John 7:39, where the exactly similar phrase, Οὔπω ῆν Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον, is rendered in the A.V., \"The Holy Spirit was not yet given.\" \"Esse pro adesse\" (Bengel). The sense given in the A.V. does not seem probable. The answer means, \"Not only have we not received the Holy Spirit, but we had not even heard that the dispensation of the Spirit was Come.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized?

Nothing can mark more strongly the connection between baptism and the reception of the Holy Spirit than this question does. For it implies, \"How could you be ignorant of the giving of the Holy Ghost if you were duly baptized?\" (comp. Acts 2:38) The answer explains it, \"We were baptized with John's baptism, to which no promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost was attached.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And Paul said for then said Paul, A.V.; John for John verily, A.V. and T.R.; Jesus for Christ Jesus, A.V. and T.R.

The formula of baptism, as commanded by the Lord Jesus himself, was, \"In [or, 'into'] the Name (αἰς τὸ ὔνομα) of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\" (Matthew 28:20). But the candidate always first made a profession of his faith in Jesus Christ, as in the A.V. of Acts 8:37; and the effect of baptism was an incorporation into Christ so as to partake of his death unto sin and his life unto righteousness. It was, therefore, a true and compendious description of baptism, to speak of it as a baptism in (or into) the Name of Jesus Christ. (See the Baptismal Service in the Book of Common Prayer.) There does not seem to be any difference of meaning between ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι and εἰς τὸ ὄνομα.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Had laid his hands, etc. (see Acts 8:17 and note).

This last is a needless change, since πείθειν properly governs an accusative of the things persuaded or taught, and it is a right English use of \"to persuade\" to apply it to the thing inculcated. For the use of the phrase \"the kingdom of God\" as a compendious description of Christian doctrine, see Acts 1:3; Acts 8:12; Acts 20:25; Acts 28:23. St. Luke uses the phrase very frequently (Luke 6:20; Luke 8:10; Luke 9:27, 60, 62; Luke 10:11; Luke 11:20; Luke 13:20, 28; Luke 16:16; Luke 17:20; Luke 21:31, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Some for divers, A.V.; disobedient for believed not, A.V.

Were hardened; or, hardened themselves. Whether considered as active or middle, the hardening their minds against the reception of the truth was just as voluntary an action as that of one who shuts his eyes that he may not see the light. For the use of σκληρύνειν (Hebrew הִקְשָׁה, applied to the heart or the neck), see Romans 9:18; Hebrews 3:8, 15; Hebrews 4:7 - passages all founded upon the LXX. of Psalm 94:8. See also Exodus 7:22; Exodus 8:19; and Ecclus. 30:11, where, as here, disobedience is the consequence of being hardened. Μήποτε σκληρυνθεὶς ἀπειθήσῃ σοι, \"Lest being hardened he disobey thee.\" The A.V., by leaving out \"were\" before \"disobedient,\" and translating as if \"hardened\" and \"disobedient\" were two adjectives, destroys this consequence. Speaking evil of; κακολογοῦντες (see Matthew 15:4; Mark 9:39), frequent in the LXX. as the rendering of קִלֵּל (Exodus 21:17; 1 Samuel 3:13), which is otherwise rendered by κακῶς εἴπειν,\" as in Leviticus 20:9. It is nearly synonymous with βλασφημαῖν. The Way (as ver. 23; see Acts 9:2, note). They would speak evil of the gospel by describing it as a blasphemy against God and against Moses, as contrary to the Law, as subversive of all the customs and traditions of the Jews, and so on. He departed. Ἀποστάσ is more than simply \"departing;\" it implies a withdrawal and separation front fellowship with them, as in 1 Timothy 6:5 (A.V.), \"From such withdraw thyself;\" Ecclesiastes 7:2, \"Depart from the unjust\" (comp. Luke 13:27). Separated the disciples. Hitherto the converted Jews at Ephesus had continued to join their unconverted brethren in the worship of the synagogue; now Paul withdrew them and separated them (ἀφώρισε, Galatians 2:10). The school of Tyrannus; σχολή, leisure; then, \"the employment of leisure,\" as especially in philosophic discussions and the like; thirdly, the \"place\" were such discussions were held, a school. It is uncertain whether Tyrannus was a Gentile well known at the time (without the τινός), who kept a lecture room for philosophic discussions or lectures on rhetoric, or whether he was a Jew who held a private school or meeting in his house - a beth-midrash - as was not uncommon in largo towns where many Jews were (Light foot, vol. 3. p. 236). \"Beth-midrash - The Jewish divinity school, where their doctors disputed of the more high and difficult matters of the Law\" (Index to Lightfoot's Works). It was commonly the upper room in the house of a rabbi (Lightfoot, on Acts 2:13, vol. 8:363), whence \"house of rabbis \"was synonymous with beth-midrash, house of discussion. The name Tyrannus occurs in 2 Macc. 4:40; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 16. 10:4; 'Bell Jud.,' 1. 26:6, of an officer in Herod's bodyguard, who might be a Jew or a Greek; and a certain Tyrannus is described by Suidas as a sophist and an author, possibly the same as is here spoken cf. Lightfoot, Meyer, Alford, and others think that the Tyrannus here spoken of was a Jew; Lange, Olshausen, Howson, Farrar, Lewin, etc., think he was a Greek philosopher or rhetorician. Some think that \"the school of Tyrannus\" was the name of the lecture-room from some former teacher (see Renan. p. 345).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For for by, A.V.; Lord for Lord Jesus, A.V. and T.R.

From his body (χρωτός); literally, the skin, but used here by St. Luke for the body, in accordance with the usage of medical writers \"from Hippocrates to Galen\" (Hobart). Handkerchiefs; σουδάριον, the Latin word sudarium, properly a cloth for wiping off the sweat. It is one of those words, like κουστωδία κεντυρίων σημικίνθιον, κοδράντης, etc., which exactly represent the political condition of things at the time of the writers, who were living in a country where Greek was the language of common intercourse, but where the dominion was Roman. It is found in Luke 19:20; John 11:44; John 20:7, and here. Aprons; σιμικίνθια, more properly written σημικίνθια. It is the Latin word semicinctium, a half-girdle; the Greek word is ἡμιζώνιον. According to some, it was a narrow girdle, but according to others, and with more probability, an apron covering only half, i.e. the front of the body. It only occurs here in the New Testament or elsewhere. The careful mention of these cures of the sick may also be connected with St. Luke's medical profession. As regards these unusual modes of miraculous cure, comp. Acts 5:15. It might well be the Divine purpose, in the case of both Peter and Paul, to invest with such extraordinary power the very persons of the apostles who were to stand forth as his messengers and preach in his Name. In St. Paul this parity of miraculous energy stamped his apostleship with an authority equal to that of St. Peter.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But certain also for then certain, A.V.; strolling for vagabond, A.V.; name for call, A.V.; the evil for evil, A.V.; I for we, A.V. and T.R. Strolling (περιερχομένων); going their rounds from place to place, like strolling players or like peddlers. The words should be construed together, \"strolling Jewish exorcists.\" That certain Jews in our Savior's time exorcised evil spirits appears from Matthew 12:27; Luke 9:49. We learn also from Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 8:2, 5, that forms of exorcism, said to have been invented by King Solomon, so efficacious that the devils cast out by them could never come back, were used with great effect in his days. He adds that he himself knew of an instance in which one of his own countrymen, Eleazar by name, had cast out devils in the presence of Vespasian and his sons and officers and a number of his soldiers. The method used was this: The exorcist applied to the nose of the possessed the bezil of a ring, under which was a certain root prescribed by Solomon, and so drew out the evil spirit through the man's nostrils. The possessed then fell to the ground, and the exorcist commanded the evil spirit in the name of Solomon never to return, and then recited one of Solomon's incantations. To give full assurance to the bystanders that the evil spirit had really left the man, the exorcist placed a vessel full of water at some distance off, and then commanded the ejected spirit to overturn it, which he did. Thus far Josephus. Lightfoot, on Acts 13. (vol. 3:215), quotes the book Juchasin as speaking of certain Jews as \"skilled in miracles,\" and the Jerusalem Talmud as speaking of their enchantments and magical tricks and charms\" in the name of Jesus\" (see, further, Alford on Matthew 12:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - A chief priest for and chief of the priests, A.V.; this for so, A.V. A chief priest (ἀρχιερεύς); not, of course, in the sense of high priest, but in that wider sense of the word which comprised the chiefs of the twenty-four courses and the members of the Sanhedrim and all who had ever been high priests or who were of the kindred of the high priest (see Matthew 2:4; Matthew 16:21; Matthew 21:15; 23:45, etc.; Luke 9:22; Luke 19:47, etc.; Acts 4:23; Acts 5:24; Acts 9:14, 21, etc.). It is probable that the Eleazar mentioned in the preceding note was a priest, both from his name and because Josephus calls him one of his ὁμοφύλων, which may mean \"fellow-tribesmen.\" The name Sceca occurs nowhere else, nor is its meaning or etymology at all certain. Some identify it with the Latin Scaera (Horace, 'Ep.,' 1. 17:1), \"left-handed,\" l.q. Scaevola; or the Greek Scenes, a proper name in Appian. Simonis gives it an Aramean etymology.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Said unto them for said, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Mastered both of them for overcame them, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Became for was, A.V.; both Jews and Greeks for the Jews and Greeks also, A.V.; that dwelt for dwelling, A.V.; upon for on, A.V. Fear fell upon them. Comp. Acts 5:11-14, where the same effects are ascribed to the death of Ananias and Sapphire and the signs and wonders which were wrought by the apostles at that time. This fear produced by the putting forth of God's power paralyzed for a time the enemies of the gospel, and enabled believers, as it were, to take possession of their new heritage, just as the miracles at the Red Sea and the destruction of Sihon and Og paralyzed the courage of the Canaanites and enabled the Israelites to take possession of their land (Joshua 2:9-11). With respect to the incident which caused this fear, it might at first seem inconsistent with our Lord's saying to the apostles (Luke 9:49, 50). But the cases were very different. He who cast out devils in the name of Jesus, in the Gospel, does not seem to have had any hostility to the faith, for our Lord speaks of him as one who \"is not against us.\" But these sons of Sceva were among the unbelieving Jews who were \"hardened and disobedient;\" and if their exorcisms had been permitted to succeed, they would have had power to withstand Paul, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and the very purpose for which miraculous power was given to St. Paul would have been frustrated. There- fore they were discomfited, and the subtle design of Satan to destroy, while seeming to magnify, the Name of Jesus was signally defeated. Comp. the somewhat similar incident at Philippi (Acts 16:16-18). Justin Martyr, in his 'Diologue with Trypho,' quoted by Alford on Matthew 12:27, speaks of the Jews as exorcising, sometimes in the name of kings (referring, doubtless, to Solomon), sometimes of just men, or of prophets, or of patriarchs. So these men took up the name of Jesus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Many also of them that had believed for and many that believed, A.V.; confessing and declaring for and confessed and showed, A.V.

It gives us a curious view of the extent to which magic prevailed among the Jews at this time. Nor was it less prevalent in heathen Ephesus. The magic formulae of Ephesus were famous under the name of Ἐφέσια γράμματα (see Renan, pp. 344,345, note), and the belief in magic seems to have been universal. Hesychius gives as the names of the oldest Ephesian charms, Aski, Kataski, Lix, Petrax, Damnameneus, AEsion, which he explains as meaning severally \"Darkness, Light,\" \"the Earth,\" \"the Year,\" \"the Truth\" (Lewin, p. 334).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMany of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And not a few for many... also, A.V.; that practiced for which used A.V.; in the sight of all for before all men, A.V.

The adjective περίεργος applied to persons means \"a busybody\" (1 Timothy 5:13), one who does what it is not his business to do, and pries into matters with which he has no concern (comp. 2 Thessalonians 3:11); applied to things, it means that which it is not anybody's business to attend to, that which is vain and superfluous; and then, by a further extension of meaning, that which is forbidden, and specially magic arts and occult sciences. Fifty thousand pieces of silver. There is a difference of opinion as to what coin or weight is meant. If Greek coinage, which is perhaps natural in a Greek city, fifty thousand drachmae of silver would be meant, equal to £1875, If Jewish shekels are meant, the sum would amount to £7000 ('Speaker's Commentary'). It is in favor of drachmae being meant that, with the exception of Joshua 7:21 and Judges 17:2, the LXX. always express the word \"shekel\" or \"didrachm\" after the numeral and before the word \"silver.\" If St. Luke, therefore, had meant shekels, he would have written δίδραχμα ἀργυρίου But it was the Greek usage to omit the word δραχμή before ἀργυρίου when the reckoning was by drachmae (Meyer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - The Lord for God, A.V.

Purposed in the spirit (ἔθετο ἐν τῷ πνεύματι); literally, set, fixed, or arranged it in his spirit, like the Hebrew phrase, שּׂוּם בְלֵב, in 1 Samuel 12, etc. Similarly of past things, Luke 1:66, ἔθεντο πάντες... ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῶν, \"laid them up in their hearts \"(comp. Acts 5:4). When he had passed through Macedonia, etc. Observe the constant solicitude of Paul to revisit the Churches which he had founded, so as to confirm the disciples in the faith and to consolidate his work (Acts 14:21; Acts 15:36; Acts 16:6; 1 Thessalonians 3:1-5, etc.). It marks the unrivalled tenderness of his heart toward the disciples. Observe also the insatiable appetite of the apostle for spiritual conquests, and his noble contempt for idleness. He has but just won Ephesus and Asia, and already he undertakes Macedonia and Achaia. Nor does his mind stop there, but reaches on to Jerusalem, then stretches onwards to Rome, and meditates the invasion of Spain. Truly neither Alexander, nor Caesar, nor any hero of antiquity was a match for this little Benjamite (paulus) in the magnanimity of his designs (Bengel).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And having sent for so he sent, A.V.; Timothy for Timotheus, A.V.; he for but he, A.V.; while for season, A.V. Two of them, etc. Erastus is here mentioned for the first time. If he is the same person who is mentioned in Romans 16:23; 2 Timothy 4:20, it is probable that he was one of St. Paul's Corinthian converts who had gone with him from Corinth to Jerusalem and Antioch, and had accompanied him through Phrygia and Galatia to Ephesus. Silos, who had been Timothy's companion on the former visit to Macedonia, seems to have left St. Paul, possibly at Jerusalem, from whence he originally came (Acts 15:22, 32, 34), and to have attached himself to Peter (1 Peter 5:12). Perhaps he was especially connected with the mission to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, etc., as it appears from the passage just quoted that he was \"a faithful brother unto them,\" A.V.; \"or our faithful brother,\" R.V. He himself stayed, etc. This phrase is in singular harmony with 1 Corinthians 16:8, which seems clearly to have been written after Timothy's departure for Macedonia and before his arrival at Corinth, since Timothy is not mentioned either in the superscription or among the salutations (1 Corinthians 1:1; 1 Corinthians 16:19, 20), and his coming to Corinth is spoken of as doubtful, though probable, in 1 Corinthians 16:10. Both passages imply a prolongation of Paul's stay at Ephesus beyond his original intention. The special reason for this prolongation of his sojourn at Ephesus, and which is alluded to in 1 Car 16:9, is thought to be the Artemisian or Ephesian games, which were celebrated at Ephesus in May - and therefore just at this time - and which brought a vast concourse of Ionians to Ephesus. It was at this time, doubtless, that the principal sale of \"silver shrines of Diana\" took place, and therefore it was natural that Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen should be very angry when they found their usual gains were cut short by the multitude of converts all over Proconsular Asia. We learn from 1 Corinthians 16:7 that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus had arrived at Ephesus from Corinth. It is likely that their presence, together with that of Tychicus and Trophimus, two Asiatic converts, enabled St. Paul to dispense with the services of Time-thy and Erastus for a time. Ἔπεσχεν, understand σεαυτόν, kept himself back, i.e. stayed; χρόνον, a while, an indefinite phrase, but indicating a short time.

Shrines of Diana, or Artemis. They were silver models of the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus, and were carried as charms on journeys and placed in people's houses to ensure to them the protection of the goddess (Meyer). These gold or silver shrines contained within them an image of Artemis (Lewin, vol. 1. p. 408), as similar ones, which have been found made of terracotta, do of Cybele (Lewin, p. 414). Repeated mention is made in Diodorus Siculus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and elsewhere, of gold or silver shrines (ναόι), which were offered to different gods as propitiatory gifts, or carried about by the owners as charms, Business; ἐργασία, here and ver. 25 (see Acts 16:16, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Gathered for called, A.V.; bust. ness for craft, A.V., but \"craft\" is the better rendering.

His true reason came out first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And for moreover, A.V. We have here a wonderful testimony from an enemy to the power and efficacy of St. Paul's labors. Asia, here and in ver. 22, etc., means Proconsular Asia, of which Ephesus was the chief city. That they be no gods, etc. This is an incidental proof that St. Paul's success at Ephesus lay chiefly among the heathen, since we know from Acts 14:15-17; Acts 17:23, 24, etc., that this was exactly his style of preaching to Gentiles, quite different from his method with Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - And not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute for so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught, A.V.; be made of no account for should be despised, A.V.; that she should even be deposed from her magnificence for her magnificence should be destroyed, A.V. and T.R. Is there danger. There is no example in St. Luke's writings, or in the New Testament, or in the LXX., of κινδυνεύει, being taken impersonally, as it is sometimes, though rarely, in G reek authors. The subject, therefore, of this sentence is τὸ μέρος (the portion, part, or business), and Τοῦτο κινδυνεύει ἡμῖν τὸ μέρος κ.τ.λ, must be construed together, \"This trade is in danger for us to come into disrepute,\" or, put into English, \"This our trade is in danger,\" etc. Come into disrepute; εἰς ἀπελεγμὸν, only found here in the New Testament; literally, into refutation; hence into disrepute, or into reproach, i.e. be a ground of reproach to us who practice it. The great goddess. An epithet especially applied to the Ephesian Diana (comp. the μεγαλειότητα at the end of the verse, and the cry, vers. 28 and 34). Lewin (vol. 1. p. 412, note) quotes Ὀμνύω τὴν μεγαλήν Ἐφεσίων Ἄρτεμιν in the Ephesian Xenophon Τῆς μεγάλης Θεᾶς Ἀρτέμιδος, in an inscription at Ephesus; Ἄρτεμις ἡ μεγάλη θεός (Achill. Tat.). Add from Pausanias, 4,31, 8, All men hold the Ephesian Diana in the greatest honor.\" From her magnificence. The R.T. reads τῆς μεγαλειότητος instead of τὴν μεγαλειότητα in the T.R. But Meyer, while he accepts the R.T., construes it \"and some of her magnificence,\" etc.; and rightly, because the genitive after καθαιρεῖν should be preceded by ἀπὸ, as Acts 13:29; Joshua 8:29; Joshua 10:27 (LXX.), and the word καθαιρεῖν is also specially used of lowering the honor of any one. All Asia and the world.

So Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 2:80 (quoted by Alford), says that at Antioch the people were wont to hold their public debates in the theatre, and that a crowded meeting was held there to forward the interests of Vespasian, then aspiring to the empire. So Josephus speaks of the people of Antioch holding a public assembly (ἐκκλησίαζοντος) in the theatre ('Bell. Jud.,' 7. 3:3). The people of the Greek city of Tarentum received the ambassadors from Rome in the theatre, \"according to the Greek custom,\" Val. Max., 2:2, 5 (Kuinoel, on Acts 19:29). The theatre at Ephesus, of which \"ruins of immense grandeur\" still remain, is said to be the largest of which we have any account (Howson, 2. p. 68). Having seized (συναρπάσαντες); a favorite word with Luke(Acts 6:12; Acts 27:12; Luke 8:29); and found also in the LXX, of Proverbs 6:25; 2 Macc. 3:27 2Macc. 4:41; but not elsewhere in the New Testament. It is a common medical word of sudden seizures. The force of the συν is that they hurried Gaius and Aristarchus along with them to the theatre, no doubt intending there to accuse them to the people. Gaius and Aristarchus. In Acts 20:4 there is mention of a certain Gains who was one of Paul's companions in travel, but who is described as \"of Derbe.\" Again in 1 Corinthians 1:14 a Gains is mentioned as one of St. Paul's converts on his first visit to Corinth, whom he baptized himself; and in Romans 16:23 (written from Corinth) we have mention of Gains as St. Paul's host, and of the whole Church, likely, therefore, to be the same person. Then we have the Gains to whom St. John's Third Epistle is addressed, and whose hospitality to the brethren was a conspicuous feature in his character, and one tending to identify him with the Gaius of Romans 16:23. We seem, therefore, to have, in immediate connection with St, Paul, Gaius of Corinth, Gains of Macedonia, and Gains of Derbe. But Gaius (or Caius, as it is written in Latin) was such a common name, and the Jews so often shifted their residence from one city to another, that it is not safe either to infer identity from identity of name, or diversity from diversity of description. Aristarchus, here described as of Macedonia, is more precisely spoken of in Acts 20:4 as a Thessalonian. In Acts 27:2, where we find him accompanying St. Paul from Caesarea to Rome, he is described as \"a Macedonian of Thessalonica.\" In Colossians 4:10 he is St. Paul's \"fellow-prisoner,' as voluntarily sharing his prison (Alford, on Colossians 4:10), and in Philemon 1:24 he is his fellow-laborer. His history, therefore, is that, having been converted on St Paul's visit to Thessalonica, he attached himself to him as one of his missionary staff, and continued with him through good report and evil report, through persecution, violence, imprisonment, shipwreck, and bonds, to the latest moment on which the light of Bible history shines.

With the courage of a pure conscience, conscious of no wrong, and therefore fearing no wrong, Paul would have gone straight to the theatre, and cast in his lot with Gaius and Aristarchus; but the disciples, knowing the savage temper of the multitude, dissuaded him; and when their entreaties were backed by the magistrates, Paul thought it his duty to yield. To enter in unto the people. Αἰσελθεῖν, or προσελθεῖν εἰς ἐπὶ τὸν δῆμον or τῷ δήμῳ are phrases implying the intention of pleading his cause before them (see Schleusner and Kuinoel, on Acts 19:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Certain also for certain, A.V.

Chief Officers of Asia. The Greek word is Asiarchs (Ἀσιάρχαι). The Asiarchs, ten in number, were officers annually chosen from all the cities of Proconsular Asia, to preside over all sacred rites, and to provide at their own expense the pub-lie games in honor of the gods and of the deity of the emperor. This necessitated their being men of high rank and great wealth, and Schleusner adds that they were priests. The name Asiarch is formed like Luciarchai, Syriarchai, Phoenicharchai, etc. We have here another striking proof of the enormous influence of Paul's preaching in Asia, that some of these very officers who were chosen to preside over the sacred rites of the gods, and to advance their honor by public games, were now on Paul's side.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSome therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - In confusion for confused, A.V.

Alexander. Some think he is the same as \"Alexander the coppersmith,\" of whose conduct St. Paul complains so bitterly (2 Timothy 4:14, 15; 1 Timothy 1:20), and he may or may not be. It seems likely that, as St. Paul's offence was speaking against the gods and their temples, the Jews, who were commonly accused of being atheists, and one of whose nation Paul was, came in for their share of the popular odium. They were anxious, therefore, to excuse themselves before the people of having had any share in St. Paul's work, and put forward Alexander, no doubt a clever man and a good speaker, to make their defense. But as soon as the people knew that he was a Jew, they refused to listen to him, and drowned his voice with incessant shouts of \"Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\" Meyer, however, thinks he was a Christian, because of the word ἀπολογεῖσθαι. The people (δῆμος, as ver. 30).

The town clerk (6 γραμματεὺς); i.e. the scribe, is the city secretary. Ὁ γραμματεὺς τῆς πόλεως, Thucyd., 7:19 (Meyer); Τοῦ γραμματέως τοῦ δήμου, inscription quoted by Howson (vol. it. p. 76, note). His office, as appears from the passage in Thucydides, was to read public documents to the people. According to some, it was not a post of much dignity at Athens (Becket, on Thucyd., 7:10); but according to Kuinoel it was an office of first-rate influence in the senate in the Greek cities of Asia, seeing the scribe was the chief registrar, had the drafting of the laws, and the custody of the archives. As there were three orders of scribes, there may have been a great difference in the political rank of each. Had quieted (καταστείλας, and κατεσταλμένους, ver. 36). Καταστέλλω means to \"arrange,\" \"put in order,\" the hair, the dress, or the like; hence \"to restrain,\" \"quiet;\" found only in these two places in the New Testament, but not uncommon in the Maccabees and in Josephus. In classical Greek, ὁ κατεσταλμένος is a man of calm, quiet demeanor, as opposed to ὁ τολμηρός, one who is bold and violent. In medical language, καταστέλλω is to soothe, calm, etc., and φάρμακα κατασταλτικά and ἀνασταλτικά are medicines which check the growth of diseases, ulcers, eruptions, and the like. Temple-keeper, in R.V. and margin of A.V. (νωκόρος); literally, temple-sweeper, from νεώσ, a temple, and κορέω, to sweep. The word Neoceros was a peculiar title, assumed first by persons and then by such cities, in Asia especially, as had the special charge of the temple and sacred rites of any particular god. It first appears on coins of Ephesus, in the reign of Nero, and was deemed a title of great honor. One inscription speaks of ὁ νεωκόρος (Ἐφεσίων) δῆμος as making a certain dedication. But another use of the term sprang up about this time. Among the vile flatteries of those corrupt times, it became usual with cities to dedicate temples and altars to the emperors, and they received in return the title, meant to be an honor, of νεωκόρος of the emperor. Some extant coins exhibit the city of Ephesus as νεωκόρος both of Diana and the emperor (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 411; Howson, vol. it. pp. 75, 76). The image which fell down from Jupiter (τοῦ Διοπετοῦς, understand ἀγάλματος, as in the 'Iphig. in Taur.,' 947), Διοπετὲς λαβεῖν ἄγαλμα; which is described in ver. 88 of the same play as \"the image (ἄγαλμα) of the goddess Diana, which they say fell down from heaven (οὐρανοῦ πεσεῖν ἀπὸ) into her temple in Tauris;\" and in line 1349 it is called Οὐρανοῦ πέσημα, τῆς Διὸς κόρης ἄγαλμα, \"The image of the daughter of Jove which fell from heaven,\" brought away from Tauris by Iphigenia and Orestes into Attica. But it does not appear that there was any tradition that the identical image brought from Tauris was carried to Ephesus. There are several representations of the Ephesian Diana, or Artemis, on coins, of which one or two are given by Lewin (vol. 1. p, 411) and by Howson (vol. it. p. 66). The image was of rude form and execution, mummy-shaped, or like an inverted pyramid; πολυμαστὴ (rendered by St. Jerome multi-mammia, and explained as intending to represent her as the nourisher of all living things: Preface to Ephesians); made of wood variously described as ebony, cedar, and vine wood. Pliny says that, though the temple itself had been restored seven times, the image had never been altered (quoted by Kuinoel).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Gainsaid for spoken against, A.V.; rash for rashly, A.V.

Robbers of temples; ἱερόσυλοι found only here in the New Testament. The verb ἱεροσυλεῖν occurs in Romans 2:22. Blasphemers of our goddess. If the A.V. is right, perhaps we may see in the phrase \"your goddess\" an indication that the town-clerk himself was more or less persuaded by St. Paul's preaching, that \"they are no gods which are made with hands,\" and did not care to speak of Diana as his own goddess. It appears also that St. Paul had not launched out into abuse of the heathen gods in general, or Diana in particular, but had preached the more excellent way by faith in Jesus Christ, to draw them from their idols (1 Thessalonians 1:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - If therefore for wherefore if, A.V.; that for which, A.V.; the courts are for the law is, A.V.; proconsuls for deputies, A.V.; accuse for implead, A.V. Against any man. Mark the skill with which the town-clerk passes from the concrete to the abstract, and avoids the mention of Paul's name. The courts are open; ἀγοραῖοι (or ἀγόραιοι) ἄγονται. Some supply the word σύνοδοι, and make the sense \"judicial assemblies,\" \"sessions,\" coming round at proper fixed intervals. But the verb ἄγονται, more naturally suggests ἡμέραι, as Bengel says (ἄγειν γενέσια τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς σκηνοπηγίας: Ὀλύμπια: γενέθλιον, etc.), and then the meaning is, \"The regular court-days are kept, when the proconsul attends to try causes;\" there is no need to have an irregular trial. So Suidas explains it, Ἡμέρα ἐνῇ ἡ ἀγορὰ. There are proconsuls. Bengel, with whom Meyer agrees, thinks the plural denotes the unbroken succession of proconsuls. But Lewin thinks it may mark the exact time of these transactions as being immediately after the poisoning of the Proconsul Junius Silanus by order of Agrippina, when the two procurators, Celer and AElius, exercised the proconsular power till the appointment of another proconsul, according to a law of Claudius to that effect. Others have other explanations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Seek for inquire, A.V.; about for concerning, A.V.; settled for determined, A.V.; the regular for a lawful, A.V. If ye seek, etc (ἐπιζητεῖτε). Ἐπιζητεῖν means either \"to make inquiry\" or\" to desire earnestly.\" The verb in the next clause, ἐπιλυθήσεται, it shall be \"settled,\" or \"solved,\" favors the first sense: \"If you wish to inquire further into the spread of Paul's doctrine, and the best way of dealing with it, the question should be decided in an assembly of the δῆμος, legally convened.\" For περὶἑτέρων, about other matters, some manuscripts read περαιτέρω, further. The regular assembly. That summoned by a magistrate in the constitutional way. The Greek cities under the Roman government preserved their rights and liberties, and the privilege of popular assemblies. The town clerk, therefore, gave them their choice of either having the case tried before the proconsuls or having it laid before the ecclesia of the demos, if they wished it to be gone into on wider and deeper grounds.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - For indeed for for, A.V.; accused for called in question, A.V.; concerning for for, A.V.; riot for uproar, A.V.; for it for whereby, A.V.; and as touching it we shall not be able to for we may, A.V. and T.R.; account for an account, A.V. We are in danger (κινδυνεύομεν: see ver. 27, note). To be accused concerning this day's riot. The Greek cannot well be so construed. The margin is right; ἐγκαλεῖσθαι στάσεως is \"to be charged with sedition;\" περὶ τῆς σήμερον is for τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας, \"this day,\" as in Acts 20:26, τῇ σήμερον ἡμέρᾳ: only in English we should say, \"on account of this day,\" i.e. what has been done this day. The R.T. places a stop after μηδενὸς αἰτίου ὑπάχοντοςρ As touching it. But \"it\" must mean \"the riot,\" which is feminine, whereas οϋ is masculine; so that the R.T. is impossible to construe. It is much better, therefore, to adhere to the T.R., which has good manuscript authority, and to construe as the A.V. Whereby, equivalent to \"on the ground of which\" (Meyer). With regard to the great tumult to which the foregoing narrative relates, it is certain that St. Luke has by no means exaggerated its importance. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after his departure from Ephesus, St. Paul speaks as one still smarting under the severity of his sufferings. In the language of trust, yet of a trust sorely tried, he speaks of the Father of mercies\" who comforteth us in all our tribulation.\" He speaks of the sufferings of Christ as abounding in him. And then, referring directly to the trouble which came upon him in Asia, he says, \"We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death\" (2 Corinthians 1:4-10). And the same tone breaks out again in 2 Corinthians 4:7-18; 2 Corinthians 6:4-10; 2 Corinthians 11:23-27; 2 Corinthians 12:9, 10. It is also very probable that it was on this occasion that Priscilla and Aquila saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own, to which he alludes in Romans 16:3, 4, written after he had reached Corinth from Macedonia, i.e. before Easter of the year So that it is certain that the riot and the danger to St. Paul's life were even greater than we should have inferred from St. Luke's narrative alone. It should be added, with reference to the three years residence at Ephesus (Acts 20:21) which this nineteenth chapter describes, that one or two important incidents which occurred are not related by St. Luke. The first is that encounter with a savage rabble to which St. Paul refers in 1 Corinthians 15:32, but of which we have no account in the Acts. It must have happened in the early part of his sojourn at Ephesus. Another is a probable visit to Corinth, inferred from 2 Corinthians 2:1; 2 Corinthians 12:14, 21; 2 Corinthians 13:1, 2; and thought to have been caused by bad accounts of the moral state of the Corinthian Church, sent to him at Ephesus. It was probably a hasty visit, and in contrast with it he says, in 1 Corinthians 16:7, with reference to his then coming visit, \"I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you.\" It is also thought that there was another letter to the Corinthians, written from Ephesus, soon after that second visit, which is now lost, but is alluded to in 1 Corinthians 5:9. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was manifestly written at this time from Ephesus (see 1 Corinthians 16:8, 19). Some think that the Epistle to the Galatians was also written from Ephesus, a little before the First Epistle to the Corinthians (see 1 Corinthians 16:1; Galatians 2:10); but Renan thinks it was written from Antioch, before he came to Ephesus.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs19:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Acts.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - I made for have I made, A.V.; concerning for of, A.V.; to teach for teach, A.V. The former treatise; literally, the first history, narrative, or discourse. The form of the Greek, τὸν μὲν τρῶτον, shows that the writer had in his mind at the time to contrast the second history, which he was just beginning, and that naturally τὸν δὲ δεύτερον or τοῦτον δὲ τὸν λόγον, ought both grammatically and logically, to have followed. But the mention of \"the apostles whom he had chosen\" drew him, as it were, into the stem of his history before he was able to describe it. O Theophilus. The omission of the title \"most excellent,\" given to Theophilus in the Gospel (Luke 1:3), is one among other indications that the publication of the Acts followed very closely upon that of the Gospel. Began both to do and to teach Some take the phrase as equivalent to did and taught; others supply the sense and continued until the day, etc.; or, which is the same thing, supply the terminus a quo, making the whole sense equivalent to \"all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day,\" etc.; others again, as Bishop Wordsworth, gather St. Luke's meaning to be that in the Acts he is about to narrate the continuance by our Lord in heaven of the work which he only began on earth. Meyer thinks that, by the insertion of the word \"began,\" the thing said or done \"is in a vivid and graphic manner denoted according to its moment of commencement;\" so that our Lord is represented as at one time actively beginning to heal, then to teach, then to walk on the sea, and so on. But the words \"began\" and \"until the day\" certainly suggest the beginning and the ending of our Lord's ministry, or rather the whole ministry from its beginning to its end, so that the meaning would be \"of all that Jesus did and taught from first to last.\" To do and to teach. So the disciples on the way to Emmaus speak of Jesus as \"a Prophet mighty in deed and word\" (Luke 24:19). Compare the stress laid upon the works of Christ in Acts 10:38, 39.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUntil the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Received for taken, A.V.; commandment for commandments, A.V.; after that he had given commandment through the Holy Ghost for after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments, A.V. The commandment or directions given by our Lord to the apostles between the Resurrection and the Ascension are recorded partly in Luke 24:44-49; Matthew 28:19, 20; Mark 16:15-18; John 21; and yet more fully in vers. 3-8 of this chapter. Through the Holy Ghost. The sense is certain. Jesus gave his charge to his apostles through the Holy Ghost. It was by the Holy Ghost abiding in him that he spake to the apostles. This is the repeated declaration of Holy Scripture. \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me\" (Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38. See also Luke 4:1; Matthew 12:28; Hebrews 9:14; and for the construction, Acts 11:28; Acts 21:4). Received up (ἀνελήφθη); the stone word as is used in the Septuagint of Elijah (2 Kings 2:10, 11). In Luke 24:5 it is carried up.

The addition of the words by many proofs makes it necessary to understand the words allowed himself (παρέστησεν ἑαυτόν) in the sense which it bears both in classic and Scriptural Greek, of proved or demon-strafed: \"To whom he gave distinct proofs of his being alive after his passion;\" the proofs follow - being \"seen of them\" for forty days at intervals, talking with them, and (ver. 9) \"being taken up while they were looking.\" Doubtless, too, he had in his mind those other proofs which he records in Acts 10:41, and those referred to by St. Paul (1 Corinthians 15:5-8). For this sense of παρίστημι, see Acts 24:13, \"to rove:\" and Lysias's 'Oration against Eratosthenes' (p. 125), where the almost identical phrase occurs which we have here, Ἀμφότερα ταῦτα πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις παραστήσω, \"I will prove both these things by many certain proofs.\" The A.V. rendering, \"infallible proofs,\" was quite justified. Stephanus says, \"De certo et indubitato signo dicitur apud Rhetoricos\" ('Thesaurus,' 9216); and the technical meaning of τεκμήριον in Aristotle is a \"demonstrative proof,\" as opposed to a σημεῖον, which leaves room for doubt; and in medical writers, which is important as regards St. Luke, the τεκμήριον is the \"infallible symptom.\" St. Luke, by the use of the word here, undoubtedly meant to express the certainty of the conclusion based on those proofs. Appearing unto them. The Greek ὀπτανόμενος, corresponding to the φανερωθεὶς of the Epistle of Barnabas, cap. 15, only occurs in the New Testament in this place. In the Septuagint of 1 Kings 8:8 it is used of the staves of the ark within the veil, which \"were not seen without.\" The idea intended to be conveyed, both by the use of this verb and by the use of διὰ (by the space of), is that our Lord was not with the apostles always, as he was before the Resurrection, but that he came and again disappeared (St. Chrysostom). They were fleeting appearances spread over forty days. The nearly related substantive, ὀπτασία, means \"a vision,\" and is frequently used by St. Luke 1:22; Luke 24:23; 26:19. It is also found in 2 Corinthians 12:l. Concerning the kingdom of God; a subject which had deeply engaged their thoughts (Luke 19:11), and on which it was most needful that they should now be fully instructed, that they might teach others (Acts 20:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He charged them not to deport for commanded them that they should not depart, A.V.; to wait for wait, A.V.; said he for saith he, A.V.; from me for of me, A.V. Being assembled, etc. (R.T. on, its μετ'αὐτῶν); more exactly, as he was assembling with them (Field, in 'Otium Norvicense'). Not to depart from Jerusalem. (See Luke 24:49.) It was necessary, according to the prophecy, Micah 4:2; Isaiah 2:3, that the gospel should go forth from Jerusalem. Wait for the promise. (See Luke 24:49.) The promise of the Father formed the subject of our Lord's discourse to the apostles on the last night of his earthly life, as recorded in John 14:16, 17, 26; John 15:26; John 16:7-14. He doubtless here refers to that conversation, though not, of course, to the record of it in the Gospel of St. John.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Indeed for truly, A.V. Ye shall be baptized, etc. (Comp. Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16; John 1:33.) St. Peter refers to this saying of the Lord's in his address to the Church of Jerusalem (Acts 11:16), and the record of it here may be an indication that St. Luke derived his information of these early events from Peter. A curious question arises as to the baptism of the apostles themselves. When were they baptized, and by whom? Chrysostom says, \"They were baptized by John.\" But it is evident, from John 3:22; John 4:1, 2, that converts were baptized with Christian, as distinct from John's, baptism in our Lord's lifetime, and hence it may seem probable, especially considering that St. Paul was baptized, that the apostles may have been baptized by Christ (Bishop Wordsworth On John 4:2). If so, the baptism with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was the complement of that baptism, not the substitute for it. \"In our case,\" says Chrysostom, \"both (the baptism of water and of the Spirit) take place under one act, but then they were divided.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - They therefore, when for when they therefore, A.V.; him for of him, A.V.; dost thou for wilt thou, A.V.; restore for restore again, A.V. Dost thou at this time, etc.? It appears from Luke 19:11 and Luke 24:21, as well as from other passages, that the apostles expected the kingdom of Christ to come immediately. It was most natural, therefore, that, after the temporary extinction of this hope by the Crucifixion, it should revive with new force when they saw the Lord alive after his passion. They had doubtless too been thinking over the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit \"not many days hence.\" Restore.

The distinctive use of the word \"Father\" here agrees with our Lord's saying in Mark 13:32, \"Neither the Son, but the Father.\" Hath set within his own authority (ἐξουσίᾳ). Hath reserved under his own authority ('Speaker's Commentary'); \"Has established by means of his own plenitude of power\" (Meyer); \"Hath put or kept in his own power (A.V., and so Afford).

Ye shall receive power (δύναμιν); a word sped-ally used of the power of the Holy Spirit (see Acts 6:8). \"Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit\" (Luke 4:14; see too Luke 24:49); \"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power\" (Acts 10:38); \"Through the power of the Holy Ghost\" (Romans 15:13); \"The demonstration of the Spirit and of power\" (1 Corinthians 2:4); \"Strengthened with might (δυνάμει) by his Spirit\" (Ephesians 3:16); \"The powers of the world to come\" (Hebrews 6:6). My witnesses. This function of the apostles, to be witnesses of Christ, is one much insisted upon in Scripture. So we read in ver. 22, \"Of these must one become ['be ordained,' A.V.] a witness with us of his resurrection.\" So again in Acts 10:40-42, \"God... showed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us.... And he commanded us to testify,\" etc. (see also Vers. 39 and 42 of the same chapter; Acts 13:31; Luke 24:48; Acts 4:33; Acts 13:31; Acts 22:15, 18, 20; Acts 26:16; 1 Peter 5:1; 1 John 1-3, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Said for spoken, A.V.; as they were looking for while they beheld, A.V.

Two men. St. Luke describes them according to their appearance. They were really angels. In like manner, in Joshua 5:13 we read, \"There stood a man over against him;\" and in Genesis 18:2, 16; Genesis 19:10, 12, 16, we read of \"the men;\" and in Judges 13:6, 8, 10, 11, of \"the man of God;\" the persons spoken of in all these cases being angels (comp. Daniel 3:25; Daniel 8:15, 16; Daniel 9:21, etc.; Zechariah 1:8, 10; Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4). Gabriel, too, means \"man of God.\" In white apparel, typical of perfect holiness, and of the glory which belongs to the inhabitants of heaven (comp. Daniel 10:5, 6; Matthew 17:2; Matthew 28:3; Mark 9:3; Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4; Revelation 7:9, 13; Revelation 3:5, 18; Revelation 4:4; Revelation 6:11; Revelation 19:8, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Looking for gazing up, A.V.; this for this same, A.V.; was received for is taken, A.V.; beheld him going for have seen him go, A.V. In like manner; i.e. in a cloud. The description of our Lord's second advent constantly makes mention of clouds. \"Behold, he cometh with clouds\" (Revelation 1:7). \"One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven\" (Daniel 7:13; and so Matthew 26:64; Luke 21:27, etc.). We are reminded of the grand imagery of Psalm 104:3, \"Who maketh the clouds his chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind.\" It may be remarked that the above is by far the fullest account we have of the ascension of our Lord. St. Luke appears to have learnt some further particulars concerning it in the interval between writing his Gospel (Luke 24:50-52) and writing the Acts. But allusions to the Ascension are frequent (Mark 16:19; John 6:62; John 20:17; Romans 8:34; Ephesians 4:8, 9; Philippians 2:9; Colossians 3:1; 1 Timothy 3:16; 1 Peter 3:22, etc.). With reference to Zeller's assertion, that in St. Luke's Gospel the Ascension is represented as taking place on the day of the Resurrection, it may freely be admitted that the narrative in the Gospel does not mark distinctly the interval of time between the different appearances and discourses of our Lord from the day of the Resurrection to that of the Ascension. It seems to group them according to their logical connection rather than according to their chronological sequence, and to be a general account of what Jesus said between the Resurrection and the Ascension. But there is nothing whatever in the text of St. Luke to indicate that what is related in the section Luke 24:44-49 took place at the same time as the things related in the preceding verses. And when we compare with that section what is contained in Acts 1:4, 5, it becomes clear that it did not. Because the words \"assembling together with them,\" in ver. 4, clearly indicate a different occasion from the apparitions on the day of the Resurrection; and as the words in Luke 24:44-49 correspond with those in Acts 1:4, 5, it must have been also on a different occasion that they were spoken. Again, the narrative of St. John, both in the twentieth and the twenty-first chapters, as well as that of Matthew 28:10, 16; Mark 16:7, precludes the possibility of the Ascension having taken place, or having been thought to have taken place, on the day of the Resurrection, or for many days after, so that to force a meaning upon the last chapter of St. Luke's Gospel which it does not necessarily bear, and which places it at variance with St. Luke's own account in the Acts (Acts 1:3; 13:31), and with the Church traditions as preserved by St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. John, is a violent and willful transaction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Nigh unto for from, A.V.; journey off for journey, A.V. Olivet, from the Vulgate Olivetum. The particular Greek form Ἐλαιὼν, Elaeon, occurs in the New Testament only here. In Luke 19:29; Luke 21:37, according to the T.R., and that followed in the R.V., it is Ἐλαιῶν, of Olives. But as St. Luke usually has τὸ ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν when he speaks of it as \"the Mount of Olives\" (Luke 19:37; Luke 22:39), and as here he calls it Elaeon, which is its name in Josephus ('Jud. Ant.,' 7:9, 2; see too 20:8, 6), it seems probable that in Luke 19:29; Luke 21:27, we ought to read, with Lachmann and Tischendorf (see Meyer on Luke 19:29), Ἐλαιὼν, Elaeon, Olivet. In the Old Testament, in 2 Samuel 15:30, it is \"the ascent of the Olives\" (A.V., \"the ascent of Mount Olivet\"); in Zechariah 14:4, \"the Mount of Olives.\" A sabbath day's journey off; i.e. six, or according to Schleusner, seven and a half, furlongs (or two thousand cubits). Josephus ('Jud. Ant.,' 20:8, 6) calls it \"five furlongs,\" but he only measured to the foot of the hill, whereas St. Luke gives the distance from the spot whence Christ ascended. Bethany itself, according to John 11:18, was fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The upper chamber for an upper room, A.V.; where they were abiding for where abode, A.V.; son of James for brother of James, A.V. The upper chamber; perhaps the same room where they had eaten the Passover with Christ (Luke 22:12); but this is very uncertain, though affirmed by Epiphanius, and by Nicephorus, who further relates that the very house in which the upper chamber was built into the back part of the temple which the Empress Helena erected on Mount Sion. The word here is ὑπερῷον, there it is ἀνώγεον. The ὑπερῷον (Hebrew עֲליּהָ, 2 Kings 4:10, 11) was the room immediately under the roof; the ἀνώγεον was synonymous. Where they were abiding. A slight change in the order of the words, as adopted in the text of the R.V., makes Peter and the other apostles the nominative case to the verb \"went up,\" instead of, as in the A.V., to \"abode.\" In regard to the list of the apostles which follows, it may be noticed first, that it is identical with that of Luke 6:14-16, except in the omission of Judas Iscariot and the order in which the apostles are named. The order in Luke seems to have followed that of natural birth and association. The brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, are classed together; Philip and Bartholomew, or Nathanael, go together, and so on. But in this list John follows Peter, his close companion in missionary work (Acts 3:1, etc.; Acts 4:12; 8:14); James follows instead of preceding John; and others are classed somewhat differently, for reasons probably analogous, but which we know not. Of the other lists that in Mark 3:16-19 agrees most nearly with that before us. In all, Simon Peter stands first. The Jude of Luke 6:16 (comp. Jude 1:1) and Acts 1:13 is called Thaddaeus in Matthew 10:3 (\" Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus,\" A.V.) and in Mark 3:18; but no doubt the persons are the same. In all the lists Philip stands fifth. In three Bartholomew is sixth, while in the list in Acts his being named after Thomas makes him seventh. In all the lists James the son of Alphaeus is ninth, and Judas Iscariot the last, except in the Acts, where he is not named, being already dead.

The women. St. Luke, in his Gospel, makes frequent mention of the women who followed our Lord, and generally of things that happened to women (see Luke 23:27, 49, 55; Luke 24:10, 22, etc. See also Luke 7:37, etc.; Luke 8:23; 10:38, 42; etc.). We notice the same tendency in the Acts, here, and in Acts 2:17, 18; Acts 5:14; Acts 9:36; Acts 12:13; Acts 16:14, 16; Acts 17:4, 34; Acts 18:26; Acts 21:9; Acts 24:24; Acts 25:23; etc. Mary the mother of Jesus appears here not as an object of worship, but as humbly joining in the prayers of the Church. And with his brethren. The Lord's brethren are spoken of by name in Matthew 13:55 as \"James, and Joses ['Joseph,' R.V.], and Simon, and Judas.\" So also Mark 6:3 (see too Acts 4:31-35). \"James the Lord's brother\" is mentioned by St. Paul (Galatians 1:19); \"the brethren of the Lord \"are mentioned 1 Corinthians 9:5; and again in John 7:3, 5, 10, \"the brethren of Jesus\" are spoken cf. This is not the place to enter upon the difficult question of their parentage. But it may suffice to say that if James and Judas are the two apostles of that name (which Alford, however, thinks they certainly were not, referring- to John 7:5, compared with John 6:67), then the brethren here spoken of as distinct from the apostles would be Joses and Simon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - These for those, A.V.; brethren for disciples, A.V. and T.R.; and there was a multitude of persons gathered together for the number of names together were, A.V.; a for an, A.V. Peter justifies his primacy by taking the lead in the first onward movement of the Church. Names is a common Hebraism for \"persons\" (see Revelation 3:4; Numbers 1:2). Gathered together; i.e. to one place and at one time (see the same phrase, Acts 2:1, 44). Wordsworth quotes Ignat., 'Ad Magnes' 7, and Clem. Romans 1:4, where the same phrase, ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ, indicative of Church unity occurs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Brethren, it teas needful that the Scripture should be fulfilled for men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, A.V.; spake before by the mouth of David for by the mouth of David spake before, A.V. It was needful, etc. So our Lord declared, \"The Scriptures cannot be broken\" (John 10:35); and \"All things must be fulfilled which were written\" ere. (Luke 24:25-27, 44-46). It is most important to our Christian integrity that we should view the Scriptures in the same light as our Lord and his apostles did, as containing real prophecies, spoken by the Holy Ghost. (Compare the manner in which the sixty-ninth psalm is here quoted with that of Hebrews 3:7.) So the Creed, \"I believe in the Holy Ghost .... who spake by the prophets\" (comp. Acts 4:25; Acts 28:25). Who was guide, etc. If St. Peter had only been addressing his brother apostles, who were well acquainted with the treachery of Judas, it would scarcely have been natural to introduce these words; they would have seemed rather to be explanatory words added by the historian. But the circumstances might be very imperfectly known to many of the hundred and twenty brethren assembled on this occasion; and if so, the reference to Judas's treachery would not be out of place in St. Peter's mouth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Among for with, A.V. ; received his portion in for had obtained part of, A.V. For he was numbered, etc. This is said in order to show that the passage in the Psalms applied strictly to Judas, seeing he had held his portion in the ministry and office of an apostle (see John 6:71). His portion; literally, his lot; i.e. the portion which fell to him by lot. The language is taken from the Old Testament (see e.g. Joshua 18:10, 11; Joshua 19:1, 10, etc.). Those who received such a portion (κλῆρον) were clergy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Obtained for purchased, A.V., an unnecessary change; his iniquity for iniquity, A.V. It is obvious that this verso and ver. 19, which are placed in a parenthesis in the R.V., are not part of St. Peter's discourse, but are explanatory words inserted by St. Luke for the instruction of Theophilus and his other readers. Falling headlong; i.e. from the tree or gallows on which he hung himself (see Matthew 27:3-8). The only apparent discrepancies in the accounts of St. Matthew and St. Luke in regard to the purchase of the field, and the name given to it, are that, according to St. Matthew's more detailed account, it was the chief priests who actually purchased the field with Judas's money, whereas St. Luke says, less accurately, that Judas purchased it. Again, St. Matthew explains the name Akel-dama as being given to the field because it was the price of the \"innocent blood\" of Jesus betrayed by Judas, whereas St. Luke's account rather suggests that it was Judas's own blood shed in his fall which gave the name. But both accounts of the name might be true, some understanding the name in one sense and some in the other. (Compare the different accounts of the name of Beer-sheba in Genesis 21:31 and Genesis 26:32, 33; of the origin of the proverb, \"Is Saul among the prophets?\" 1 Samuel 10:11, 12 and 1 Sam 20:24; and other similar cases.) Though, however, there is no serious discrepancy between St. Luke and St. Matthew, it is probable, from the variations above named, that St. Luke had not seen St. Matthew's account.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Became known for was know,, A.V.; that in their language that field was called Akeldama for as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Made desolate for desolate, A.V.; office (as in margin) for bishopric, A.V. The book of Psalms, one of the recognized divisions of the canonical Scriptures, as we find Luke 24:44, \"The law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms,\" the last standing for the Hagiographa, of which it was the first and principal book. Here, however, as in Luke 20:42, it may rather mean the Book of Psalms proper. (For similar quotations from the Psalms, see Acts 13:33-35; Hebrews 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, etc.) His office let another take. Bishop being the English transliteration of ἐπίσκοπος, bishopric is, of course, the literal rendering of ἐπισκοπή; if taken in its wider and more general sense, as in the well-known work of Archdeacon Evans? \"the bishopric of souls.\" This same office is called a διακονία (a deaconship), and ἀποστολὴ (an apostleship) in vers. 17 and 25. So St. Paul cells himself διάκονος (a minister) in Ephesians 3:7; Colossians 1:23, 25, etc. So the presbyters of the Church are called bishops (Acts 20:17, 28; 1 Timothy 1:1, 2. etc.). The ecclesiastical names for the different offices in the Church only acquired their distinctive use later, and by the gradual growth of custom. In the Septuagint, ἐπισκοπή answers to the Hebrew פְקֻדָּה, A.V., \"oversight\" (Numbers 3:32; Numbers 4:16, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Of the men therefore for wherefore of these men, A.V.; event out for out, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The day for that same day, A.V.; received for taken, A.V.; of these must one become for must one be ordained to be, A.V. Beginning belongs to the Lord Jesus. He began to go in and out among his apostles from the time that John baptized, and continued to do so till his ascension, the day that he was received up (\"taken up\" A.V.), as in ver. 11. This definition of the time of our Lord's public ministry exactly agrees with Matthew 4:12-25; Mark 1; Luke 3, 4; John 1:29-51. Must one become a witness, etc. The resurrection of Christ from the dead thus appears to be a cardinal doctrine of the gospel. The whole truth of Christ's mission, the acceptance of his sacrifice, the consequent forgiveness of sins, and all man's hopes of eternal life, turn upon it. All the sermons of the apostles recorded in the Acts and the Epistles also agree with this (see Acts 2, 3, 4; Acts 5:31, 32; Acts 6:56, 59; 10:39-41; 13:30, etc.; Romans 1:4; 1 Corinthians 15:4; 2 Corinthians 1:9, etc.; 1 Peter 1.3; 3:21,22; Revelation 1:5,etc.). The great care taken to secure competent witnesses is very remarkable. A disciple who had recently joined the company might be mistaken; one who had been the daily companion of Jesus Christ for three years and a half, and knew every gesture and every feature of the Master with perfect certainty, could not be mistaken.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Put forward for appointed, A.V.; Barsabbas for Barsabas, A.V. and T.R. Joseph called Barsabbas (or Barsabas). Nothing more is really known of him. His work for Christ has no earthly record, except that Papias (Euseb., 'H.E.,' 3:39) says that, having drunk some deadly poison, by the grace of God he sustained no harm. Eusebius elsewhere (Acts 1:12) says that he and Matthias were reported to be of the seventy, which is not improbable. The derivation of the name Barsabas, or Barsabbas, is unknown; it seems to be a patronymic (son of Sabas, or Sabbas), like Bar-Tholomew, Bar-Jonas, Bar-Jesus, etc. But it might also be descriptive of his qualities, like Barnabas, Son of Consolation (Acts 4:36), in which case one would expect it to mean the same as Justus, as in the case of \"Thomas called Didymus\" (John 20:4; where Thomas and Di-dymus both mean \"a twin\"); but no Aramean word of this signification is forthcoming. The surname Justus, with its derivatives Justinus and Justinianus, was not an uncommon Roman name. It was also borne by a Jewish historian contemporary with Josephus, Justus of Tiberias, the son of Pistus (see 'Life of Josephus,'§§ 35, 65) and was the surname of James the Less. Matthias not otherwise known, but said by Nicephorus to have preached and suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia. Eusebius ('H. E.,'3:24) mentions spurious Gospels \"of Peter, Thomas, Matthias, and others,\" as quoted by heretics. A work called 'The Traditions of Matthias'is referred to by Clemens Alexandrinus ('Strom.,' 2:163).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Of these two the one whom for whether of these two, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - To take the place in this for that he matt take part of this, A.V. and T.R.; fell away for by transgression fell, A.V.

To his own place. An awful phrase, showing that every man has the place in eternity which he has made for himself in time. If the reading place, in the beginning of the verse, is adopted instead of the part (κλῆρον) of the A.V., then them is a contrast between the blessed place of apostleship, which Judas forfeited, and that of traitorship, which he acquired.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - They gave lots for them for they gave forth their lots, A.V. and T.R. (αὐτοῖς for αὐτῶν); but the T.R. gives the easiest sense. The exact mode of taking the lot does not appear. Some think the name of each candidate was written on a tablet, and that the first name which fell out of the urn after it had been shaken was the one chosen. Some think the lot was taken by dice. But however the taking of the lot was managed, the effect was to leave the choice to God in answer to prayer.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Having sent for... and exhorted for called unto him, A.V. and T.R.; took leave of them, and departed for and embraced them, and departed, A.V. Departed for to go into Macedonia. This was St. Paul's purpose, as he had written to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 16:5) from Ephesus. He judged it wise, not only with a view to his own safety and that of his companions, but also for the rest and quiet of the Ephesian Church, to take advantage of the lull in the popular storm, and withdraw into quiet waters before any fresh outbreak occurred. Aquila and Priscilla seem to have left Ephesus about the same time, or soon after, since the Epistle to the Romans found them again at Rome (Romans 16:3, 4); and, if the view mentioned in the note to Acts 19:40 is true - that in the riot they had saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own - there were probably the same prudential motives for their leaving Ephesus as there were in the case of the apostle.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Through for over, A.V.

Those parts; μέρη, a word especially used of geographical districts: τὰ μέρη τῆς Γαλιλαίας: τὰ μέρη Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος (Matthew 2:22; Matthew 15:21; see too Acts 2:10; Acts 19:1). Greece (Ἑλλάδα, not Ἀχαι'αν, as Acts 19:21; Acts 18:12, and elsewhere). Macedonia and Achaia are always coupled together (see Tacit., 'Ann..' 1:76). as in Romans 15:26; 1 Thessalonians 1:7, 8. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia, it is always Achaia (2 Corinthians 1:1, etc.). In fact, Ἑλλάς is found nowhere else in the New Testament, Achaia being the name of the Roman province. Bengel and others understand Hellas here of the country between Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, especially Attica; which would make it probable that St. Paul revisited Athens. But Meyer, Kuinoel, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc., think it is synonymous with Achaia. There must, however, be some reason for this unusual use of Hellas instead of Achaia. None seems so likely as that it was meant to cover wider ground than Achaia would naturally indicate, namely Attica.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When he had spent ... there for there abode, A.V.; a plot was laid against him by the Jews for when the Jews laid wait for him, A.V.; for for into, A.V.; determined for purposed, A.V. (ἐγένετο γνώμης, R.T.). When he had spent three months. For this use of ποιεῖν, see Acts 15:33; Acts 18:33. See also 2 Corinthians 11:25, where the R.V. varies the rendering, and seems to take ποιεῖν as a verb neuter, as the A.V. does here, the accusative (μῆνας τρεῖς) being taken as that of time how long. And a plot, etc. There is no \"and\" in the Greek. It is better to take the T.R., and to consider ποιήσας as a nominative pendens as ἐπιγνόντες is in Acts 19:34, according to the reading of Meyer, Alford, etc. A plot was laid against him by the Jews. It appears from this that Apollos had not succeeded in subduing the bigoted hatred of the Corinthian Jews. But probably the desperate measure of a plot against his life (ἐπιβουλή, as in Acts 9:23, 24; ver. 19 of this chapter, and Acts 23:30) is an indication that many of their number had joined the Church; and that the unbelieving remnant, being foiled in argument, had recourse to violence. He determined; literally, according to the R.T., he was of opinion. But the T.R. has ἐγένετο γνώμη, \"his opinion was,\" the construction of the sentence being changed. The three months were probably chiefly spent at Corinth, according to the intention expressed in 1 Corinthians 16:6, though it would seem that he had stayed a longer time in Macedonia than he anticipated. It was during his sojourn at Corinth that the Epistle to the Romans was written.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - As far as for into, A.V.; Beraea for Berea, A.V.; the son of Pyrrhus is added in the R.T. and R.V.; Timothy for Timotheus, A.V. Accompanied; συνείπετο, peculiar to Luke in the New Testament, but common in medical writers. As far as Asia. If it were merely said, \"there accompanied him,\" it might have been thought, with regard to the Macedonians Sopater, Aristarchus, and Secundus, that they had merely gone as far as their respective cities, Beraea and Thessalonica; it is therefore added (in most manuscripts, though not in B or the Codex Sinaiticus), \"as far as Asia.\" It does not necessarily follow that they all went as fax as Jerusalem, though we know Trophimus and Aristarchus did. Sopater may probably be the same as Sosipater (Romans 16:21), whom St. Paul calls \"his kinsman,\" though some think \"the son of Pyrrhus\" was added to distinguish him from him. The Thessalonian Aristarchus is doubtless the same as the person named in Acts 19:29; Acts 27:2; and so one would have thought Gaius must be the same as is named with Aristarchus in Acts 19:29, were it not that this Gaius is described as of Derbe, whereas the Gaius of Acts 19:29 was a man of Macedonia. Gaius of Derbe is here coupled with Timothy, who was of the neighboring city of Lystra (Acts 16:1), but was too well known to make it needful to specify his nationality. Secundus is not mentioned elsewhere. Compare Tertius and Quartus (Romans 16:22, 23), and the common Roman names, Quinctus, Sextus, Septimus, Octavius, Decimus. Tychicus, of Asia, is mentioned in Ephesians 6:21; Colossians 4:7; 2 Timothy 4:12; Titus 3:12; by which we learn that he continued to be in constant attendance on St. Paul, and have abundant confirmation of his being \"of Asia.\" Trophimus is called \"an Ephesian\" (Acts 21:29), and is named again as a companion of St. Paul, and presumably \"of Asia\" (2 Timothy 4:20). It is not improbable that some at least of there followers were chosen by the Churches to carry their alms to Jerusalem (see 2 Corinthians 8:19-23; 2 Corinthians 9:12, 13; 1 Corinthians 16:3, 4; Romans 15:25-28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese going before tarried for us at Troas.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - But these had gone for these going, A.V. and T.R.; and were waiting for tarried, A.V. The narrative is so concise that the exact details are matters of conjecture. There is consequently much difference of opinion about them. Howson, with whom Farrar (vol. 2:274) apparently agrees, thinks that the whole party traveled together by land through Bercea and Thessalonica, to Philippi; that the party consisting of Sopater, Aristarchus and Secundus, Gains, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, went on at once from Philippi via Neapolis, to Troas, leaving St. Paul, who was now joined by St. Luke, at Philippi, to pass eight or nine days there during the Feast of the Passover. And this seems quite consistent with St. Luke's narrative. But Lewin (vol. it. p. 74) thinks that only St. Paul (accompanied, as he supposes, by Luke, Titus, and Jason) went to Macedonia, and that the others sailed direct from Cenchreae to Troas. Renan, on the other hand, thinks they all sailed together from Cenchreae to Neapolis, whence Paul's party went to Philippi, and the others to Troas. There is no clue to the reason why the party thus separated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Tarried for abode, A.V. We; distinctly marking that Luke, the author of the narrative, whom we left at Philippi (Acts 16:13, 14), joined him again at the same place. Renan (p. 498) well remarks, \"At Philippi Paul once more met the disciple who had guided him for the first time to Macedonia. He attached him to his company again, and thus secured as his companion in the voyage the historian who was to write an account of it, with such infinite charm of manner and such perfect truth.\" It may be noted that this passage is quite conclusive against the notion entertained by some, that Timothy was the writer of the Acts. From Philippi; i.e. from Neapolis, the port of Philippi. After the days of unleavened bread, which lasted eight days, including the day of eating the Passover. In five days. An unusually long voyage, owing, doubtless, to unfavorable winds. On the former occasion when he sailed from Troas to Neapolis he was only two days (Acts 16:11). Where we tarried seven days. As the last of these seven days was Sunday - \" the first day of the week\" - he must have arrived on the preceding Monday, and left Neapolis on the preceding Thursday. Some, however, reckon the days differently. It must be remembered that the apostle's movements were dependent upon the arrival and departure of the merchant ships by which he traveled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - We were gathered for the disciples came, A.V. and T.R.; discoursed with for preached unto, A.V.; intending for ready, A.V.; prolonged for continued, A.V. The first day of the week. This is an important evidence of the keeping of the Lord's day by the Church as a day for their Church assemblies (see Luke 24:1, 30, 35; John 20:19, 26; 1 Corinthians 16:2). To break bread. This is also an important example of weekly communion as the practice of the first Christians. Comparing the phrase, \"to break bread,\" with St. Luke's account of the institution of the Holy Eucharist (Luke 22:19) and the passages just quoted in Luke 24, and St. Paul's language (1 Corinthians 10:16; 1 Corinthians 11:24), it is impossible not to conclude that the breaking of bread in the celebration of the Lord's Supper is an essential part of the holy sacrament, which man may not for any specious reasons omit. Further, this passage seems to indicate that evening Communion, after the example of the first Lord's Supper, was at this time the practice of the Church. It was preceded (see ver. 11) by the preaching of the Word. The following description, given by Justin Martyr, in his second Apology to Antoninus Plus (or Marcus Aurelius), of the Church assemblies in his day, not a hundred years after this time, is in exact agreement with it: - \"On the day which is called Sunday, all (Christians) who dwell either in town or country come together to one place. The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read for a certain time, and then the president of the meeting, when the reader has stopped, makes a discourse, in which he instructs and exhorts the people to the imitation of the good deeds of which they have just heard. We then all rise up together, and address prayers (to God); and, when our prayers are ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president, to the best of his ability, offers up both prayers and thanksgivings, and the people assent, saving 'Amen.' And then the distribution of the bread and wine, over which the thanksgivings have been offered, is made to all present, and all partake of it.\" He adds that the elements are carried to the absent by the deacons, and that collections are made for poor widows, and orphans, and sick, and prisoners. Discoursed (διελέγετο); Acts 17:17, note. Prolonged (παρέτεινε).

It is not obvious why St. Luke mentions the many lights. Some say to mark the solemnity of the first day of the week (Kuinoel); some, to remove all possible occasion of scandal as regards such midnight meetings (Bengel); some, to explain how the young man's fall was immediately perceived (Meyer); others, to account for the young man's drowsiness, which would be increased by the many lights, possibly making the room hot (Alford); for ornament (Olshausen). But possibly it is the mere mention by an eye-witness of a fact which struck him. It is obvious that the room must have been lit for a night meeting - only perhaps there were more lights than usual.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The for a, A.V.; borne down with for being fallen into a, A.V.; discoursed yet longer for was long preaching, A.V.; being borne down by his sleep he for he sunk down with sleep, and, A.V.; story for loft, A.V.

Borne down; καταφερόμενος, the proper word in connection with sleep, either, as here, when sleep is the agent, or, followed by εἰς ὕπνον, falling into sleep. Yet longer; rather, as in the A.V., long; i.e. longer than usual, somewhat or very long.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Make ye no ado for trouble not yourselves, A.V. Fell on him, and embracing him said; imitating the action of Elijah and Elisha (1 Kings 17:17-21; 2 Kings 4:34). Make ye no ado (μὴ θορυβεῖσθε). Θόρυβος and θορυβεῖσθαι are words especially used of the lamentations made for the dead. Thus when Jesus came to the house of Jairus, he found the multitude outside the house, θορυβούμενον, \"making a tumult.\" This is still more clearly brought out in Mark 5:38, 39, \"He beholdeth a tumult (θόρυβον), and many weeping and wailing greatly. And... he saith unto them, Why make yea tumult (θορυβεῖσθε), and weep? The child is not dead, but sleepeth.\" In exactly the same way St. Paul here calms the rising sobs and wailings of the people standing round the body of Eutychus, by saying, Μὴ θορυβεῖσθε,\" Do not wail over him as dead, for his life is in him.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And when he was gone up for when he therefore was come up again, A.V.; the bread for bread, A.V. and T.R.; had talked with them for talked, A.V. Had broken the bread; i.e. the bread already prepared, and spoken of in ver. 7 (where see note), but which had not yet been broken in consequence of Paul's long discourse. And eaten. Γενσάμενος does not seem to mean \"having eaten of the bread broken,\" for the word is never used of the sacramental eating of bread. That word is always φάγειν (1 Corinthians 11:20, 24) or ἐσθίειν (1 Corinthians 11:26, 27, 28, 29). But γευσάμενος seems rather to be taken absolutely, as in Acts 10:10, \"having eaten,\" meant \"having partaken\" of the meal, the agape, which followed the Eucharist. Talked with them (ὁμιλήσας). Of familiar converse (Luke 24:14, 15; Acts 24:26).

If the clause in the T.R. is genuine, they did not pass the night at Samos, but \"made a short run from thence in the evening to Trogyllium (Alford), \"the rocky extremity of the ridge of Mycale, on the Ionian coast, between which and the southern extremity of Samos the channel is barely a mile wide\" ('Speaker's Commentary'). We came to Miletus. Anciently the chief city of Ionia, and a most powerful maritime and commercial place, about twenty-eight miles south of Ephesus; though in the time of Homer it was a Carian city. In St. Paul's time it was situated on the south-west coast of the Latmian gulf, just opposite the mouth of the Meander on the east. But since his time the whole gulf of Latmos has been filled up with soil brought down by the river, so that Miletus is no longer on the seacoast, and the new mouth of the Meander is to the west instead of to the east of Miletus, which lies about eight miles inland (Lewin, vol. it. p. 90; Smith's 'Dict. of Geog.'). Miletus was the scat of a bishopric in after times. As regards this visit to Miletus, some identify it with that mentioned in 2 Timothy 4:20. And it is certainly remarkable that so many of the same persons in connection with the same places are mentioned in both passages and in the pastoral Epistles generally. The identical persons are Paul, Timothy, Luke, Trophimus, Tychicus, and Apollos (Acts 20:4, 5, compared with 2 Timothy 4:11, 12, 20); and the identical places are Corinth, Thessalonica, Troas, Ephesus, Miletus, and Crete. But the other circumstances do not agree well with the events of this journey, but seem to belong to a later period of St. Paul's life (see below, ver. 25, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Past for by, A.V.; that he might not have to for because he would not, A.V.; time for the time, A.V.; was hastening for hasted, A.V.

The time of year is rims very distinctly marked. Paul was at Philippi at the time of the Passover, and hoped to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Called to him for called, A.V. The R.V. gives the force of the middle voice μετεκαλέσατο. The elders of the Church; viz. of Ephesus. These are manifestly the same as are called ἐπισκόπους in ver. 28, \"overseers,\" or bishops. The distinctive names and functions of Church officers were not yet fixed; and the apostles themselves, aided by degrees by such as Timothy and Titus, were what we now call bishops, exercising oversight over the elders themselves as well as over the whole flock (see 1 Timothy 3:1). The diocesan episcopate came in gradually as the apostles died off, and the necessity for a regular episcopate arose (see Acts 6:1-6; Acts 14:23, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Ye yourselves for ye, A.V.; set foot in for came into, A.V.; was for have been, A.V.; all the time for at all seasons, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTServing the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Lowliness for humility, A.V.; tears for many tears, A.V. and T.R.; with trials for temptations, A.V.; plots for lying in wait, A.V. Plots (ἐπιβουλαῖς); comp. ver. 3, and note. There is no special account of Jewish plots in St. Luke's narrative of St. Paul's sojourn at Ephesus. But from Acts 19:9, 13, and probably 33, we may gather how hostile the unbelieving Jews were to him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - How that I shrank not from declaring unto you anything for and how I kept back nothing, A.V.; profitable for profitable unto you, A.V; and teaching for but have showed you and have taught, A.V. I shrank not from declaring, etc. The R.V. seems to construe the phrase as if it were Ὡς ὑπεσταιλάμην τοῦ μὴ ἀναγγεῖλαι ὑμῖν οὐδὲν τῶν συμφερόντων, which is a very labored construction, of which the only advantage is that it gives exactly the same sense to ὑπεστειλάμην as it has in ver. 27. But it is much simpler to take οὐδὲν here as governed by ὑπεστειλάμην, and to take the verb in its very common sense of \"keeping back,\" or \"dissembling\" (see the very similar passages quoted by Kuinoel from Demosthenes, Plato, Socrates, etc., Οὐδὲν ὑποστειλάμενος, μηδὲν ὑποστείλαμεμος κ.τ.λ.), and to take the τοῦ μὴ ἀναγγεῖλαι ὑμῖν καὶ διδάξαι as expressing what would have been the effect of such \"keeping back,\" or \"dissembling,\" the μὴ extending to both infinitives (Meyer), \"so as not to declare and teach,\" etc. In ver. 27 the verb ὑπεστειλάμην must be taken in the equally common sense of \"holding back,\" or \"shrinking,\" under the influence of fear, or indolence, or what not. The difference of rendering is required by the fact that here you have οὐδὲν ὑπεστειλάμην, whereas in ver. 27 you have οὐκ ὑπεστειλάμην In several of the classical passages quoted above, and others in Schleusner, ὑποστέλλεσθαι is opposed to παρρησίαζεσθαι, or, μετὰ παρρησίας διαλεχθῆναι (comp. therefore for the sentiment, Acts 2:29; Acts 4:13, 29, 31; Acts 9:27; Acts 13:46; Acts 14:3; Acts 28:31, etc.; Ephesians 6:19, 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTestifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - To Jews and to Greeks for both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, A.V. (see Acts 19:10, 17). Repentance, etc. The two cardinal points of gospel teaching, as they are the two necessary qualities for every Christian man. \"Repentance whereby we forsake sin, and faith whereby we steadfastly believe the promises of God.\" There is no ground for the remarks of Kuinoel and others, that repentance is to be referred chiefly to the Gentiles, and faith to the Jews (see Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19; Acts 5:31, etc.; Mark 1:15, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Bound in the spirit. Τῷ πνεύματι, may either mean \"in my spirit\" or \"by the Spirit,\" i.e. the Holy Ghost. If the former, which is the most probable sense (as τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον follows in the next verse), is taken, the sense will be that St. Paul felt himself constrained to go to Jerusalem. A sense of absolute necessity was upon him, and he did not feel himself a free agent to go anywhere else. If the latter sense be taken, the meaning will be that the Holy Ghost was constraining him to go to Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Testifieth unto me for witnesseth, A.V. and T.R. The Holy Ghost, speaking by the prophets in the different Church assemblies, as the apostle journeyed from city to city. We have one instance of such prophesying recorded in Acts 21:10, 11. The instances to which St. Paul here alluded were not mentioned in Luke's brief narrative.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - I hold not my life of any account, as dear for none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear, A.V. and T.R.; may accomplish my course for might finish my course with joy, A.V. and T.R.; received for have received, A.V.; from for of, A.V. I hold not my life, etc. It is inconceivable that St. Paul should have uttered, or St. Luke have reported, such an unintelligible sentence as that of the R.T., when it was perfectly easy to express the meaning clearly. Neither does the mention of his life, in the first instance, tally with that of \"bonds and afflictions.\" The T.R., which has considerable support, seems to be far preferable. The first clause, Οὐδενὸς λόγον ποιοῦμαι, means quite naturally,\" I take no account of anything;\" I value nothing, neither liberty, nor ease, nor comfort. I am ready to suffer the loss of all things, and I do count them as dung (Philippians 3:7-9); and then he adds yet further, \"Neither do I count my own life as precious, so as to accomplish my course,\" etc. This metaphor of running a race is a favorite one with St. Paul (1 Corinthians 9:24; Galatians 5:7; Philippians 3:13, 14; 2 Timothy 4:7). To testify the gospel of the grace of God. An invaluable epitome of the Christian ministry. The essential feature of the gospel is its declaration of God's free grace to a guilty world, forgiving sins, and imputing righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The distinctive work of the ministry is to declare that grace. So St. Paul describes his own ministry, and the record of his ministry in the Acts and in his Epistles exactly agrees with this description.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Went about for have gone, A.V.; kingdom for kingdom of God, A.V. and T.R. I know that ye all, etc. It is a very perplexing question whether St. Paul in this statement spake with prophetic, and therefore infallible, foreknowledge, or whether he merely expressed the strong present conviction of his own mind, that he should never return to Asia again. The question is an important one, as the authenticity of the pastoral Epistles is in a great measure bound up with it. For, in the apparent failure of all hypotheses to bring the writing of them within the time of St. Luke's narrative, prior to St. Paul's journey to Rome, we are driven to the theory which places the writing of them, and the circumstances to which they allude, to a time subsequent to St. Paul's imprisonment at Rome. But this involves the supposition that St. Paul returned to Ephesus after his release from his Roman imprisonment (1 Timothy 1:3; 1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1:15, 18; 2 Timothy 4:9-14, 19; Titus 1:5), and consequently that St. Paul's anticipation, that he was in Asia for the last lime, was not realized. The question is well discussed by Alford, in the 'Prolegomena to the Pastoral Epistles,' and in Paley's 'Horae Paulinae,' Acts 11. But it can hardly be said to be definitively settled (see above, note to ver. 15). Bengel thinks the explanation may be that most of those present were dead or dispersed when Paul returned some years later.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Testify unto you for take you to record, A.V. The solemnity of this address is dependent upon the speaker's conviction that he was speaking to his hearers for the last time. Hence the force of the words, \"this day\" (ἐν τῇ σήμερον ἡμέρᾳ); \"my last opportunity.\" I am pure, etc. (comp. Ezekiel 3:17-21; Ezekiel 33:2, 9; Hebrews 13:17). Note the peril of hiding or watering God's truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Shrank not from declaring for have not shunned to declare, A.V. (see ver. 20, note); the whole for all the, A.V. Counsel of God. His revealed will and purpose concerning man's salvation (Acts 2:23; Acts 4:28; Ephesians 1:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Take heed for take heed therefore, A.V. and T.R.; in for over, A.V.; bishops for overseers, A.V.; purchased for hath purchased, A.V. Take heed, etc.; προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς, peculiar to Luke (Acts 5:53; Luke 12:1; Luke 17:3; Luke 21:34). Now follows the weighty charge of this great bishop to the clergy assembled at his visitation. With the true feeling of a chief pastor, he thinks of the whole flock, but deals with them chiefly through the under-shepherds. If he can awaken in these individually a deep concern for the souls committed to their charge, he will have done the best that can be done for the fleck at large. The first step to such concern for the flock is that each be thoroughly alive to the worth and the wants of his own soul. \"Take heed unto yourselves.\" He that is careless about his own salvation will never lie careful about the souls of others (comp. 1 Timothy 4:16). In the which the Holy Ghost, etc. Ἐν ῷ, no doubt, does not strictly contain the idea of \"over which;\" but the idea of authoritative oversight is contained in the word ἐπίσκοπος, and therefore the rendering of the A.V., and of Alford's A.V. revised, is substantially correct. Perhaps the exact force of the ἐν ῷ is \"among which,\" like ἐν ἡμῖν (Acts 2:29, and elsewhere). The call and appointment to the ministry is the special function of the Holy Ghost (John 20:22, 23; Acts 12:2; Ordination Service). To feed; ποιμαίνειν, the proper word for \"tending\" in relation to τὸ ποίμνιον, the flock, as ποιμήν, the pastor, or shepherd, is for him who so feeds the flock of Christ (see John 10:11, 16; John 21:17; Hebrews 13:20; 1 Peter 5:2, 3). St. Peter applies the titles of \"Shepherd and Bishop of souls\" to the Lord Jesus (1 Peter 2:25). St. Paul does not use the metaphor elsewhere, except indirectly, and in a different aspect (1 Corinthians 9:7). The Church of God; margin, Church of the Lord. There is, perhaps, no single passage in Scripture which has caused more controversy and evoked more difference of opinion than this. The T.R. has τοῦ Θεοῦ, but most uncials have τοῦ Κυρίου. Kuinoel asserts that the reading τοῦ Κυρίου rests on the authority, besides that of the oldest manuscripts, of the old versions, and of many el' the most ancient Fathers, and says that it is undoubtedly the true reading. Meyer, too, thinks that the external evidence for τοῦ Κυρίου is decisive, and that the internal evidence from the fact that ἐκκλησία τοῦ Κυρίου Occurs nowhere else in St. Paul's writings, is decisive also. But on the other hand, both the Codex Vaticanus (B) and the Codex Sinaitieus (א), the two oldest manuscripts, have Θεοῦ (Θυ). The Vulgate, too, and the Syriac have it; and such early Fathers as Ignatius (in his Epistle to the Ephesians) and Tertullian use the phrase, \"the blood of God,\" which seems to have been derived from this passage. And Alford reasons powerfully in favor of Θεοῦ, dwelling upon the fact that the phrase ἐκκλησία τοῦ Θεοῦ occurs ten times in St. Paul's writings, that of ἐκκλησία τοῦ Κυρίου not once. The chief authorities on each side of the question are:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) in favor of τοῦ Κυρίου, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Bornemann, Lunge, Olshausen, Davidson, Meyer, Hackett, as also Grotius, Griesbaeh (doubtfully), Wetstein, Le Clerc, and others;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) in favor of τοῦ Θεοῦ, Bengel, Mill, Whitby, Wolf, Scholz, Knapp, Alford, Wordsworth, etc., and the R.T. It should be added that the evidence for τοῦ Θεοῦ has been much strengthened by the publication by Tischendorf, in 1563, of rite Codex Sinaiticus, and in 1867 of the Codex Vaticanus, from his own collation. The result is that τοῦ Θεοῦ seems to be the true reading (see the first of the two collects for the Ember weeks in the Book of Common Prayer. With regard to the difficulty that this reading seems to imply the unscriptural phrase, \"the blood of God,\" and to savor of the Monophysite heresy, it is obvious to reply that there is a wide difference between the phrase as it stands and such a one as the direct \"blood of God,\" which Athanasius and others objected to. The mental insertion of \"the Lord\" or \"Christ,\" as the subject of the verb \"purchased,\" is very easy, the transition from God the Father to God incarnate being one that might be made almost imperceptibly. Others (including the R.T.) take the reading of several good manuscripts, Διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ ἰδίου, and understand τοῦ ἰδίου to be an ellipse for τοῦ ἰδίου υἱοῦ, the phrase used in Romans 8:32; and so render it \"which he purchased by the blood of his own Son.\" Οἱ ἰδίοι, his own, is used without a substantive in John 1:11. This clause is added to enhance the preciousness of the flock, and the responsibility of those who have the oversight of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - I know for, for I know this, A.V. and T.R.; grievous wolves shall for shall grievous wolves, A.V. After my departure (ἄφιξιν, not ἀνάλυσιν, as 2 Timothy 4:6). The word, which is only found here in the New Testament, usually means \"arrival\" in classical Greek, but it also means, as here, \"departure.\" It is not to be taken in the sense of \"departure from this life,\" but refers to that separation, which he thought was forever, which was about to take place. Grievous wolves; still keeping up the metaphor of the flock. The wolves denote the false teachers, principally Judaizers. See 2 Timothy 3:1-12, and 13, \"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.\" These came from Judaea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And from among for also of, A.V.; the disciples for disciples, A.V. From among your own selves; as opposed to the strangers from Judaea in the preceding verse. So 2 Timothy 4:3, \"The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears\" (see, as instances, 2 Timothy 2:17, 18; 2 Timothy 4:14). Speaking perverse things. So 2 Timothy 4:4, \"They shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\" To draw away the disciples, etc.; i.e. to induce Christians to leave the communion and doctrine of the Church, and join their heresy. The A.V., \"to draw away disciples,\" is manifestly wrong; τοὺς μαθητὰς are Christ's disciples. For the general statement, see 2 Timothy 3:6, \"They which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women;\" and comp. Romans 16:17, 18, which, according to Renan, was addressed to the Ephesians. For the rise of false teachers in Asia, see 1 Timothy 1:3, 20; 1 Timothy 4:1-7; 1 Timothy 6:20, 21; 2 Timothy 1:15; 1 John 2:26; 1 John 4:1, 3, 5; and through the whole Epistle; Revelation 2:1-7.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Wherefore watch ye for therefore watch, A.V.; remembering for and remember, A.V.; admonish for warn, A.V. By the space of three years (τριετίαν). The word is only found here in the New Testament; but it is used in the LXX. of Isaiah 15:5 and 2 Chronicles 31:16, and in classical Greek. We have here one of the few chronological data in the Acts. Three years includes the whole of his sojourn at Ephesus as his headquarters. There were first the three months during which he preached in the synagogue; then the two years which he spent in preaching in the school of Tyrannus, and which terminated with the incident of burning the books of magic (Acts 19:8, 10, 19). Then there was an indefinite time described in Acts 19:22 as \"for a while\" (αὐτὸς ἐπέσχε χρόνον), during which he was busy making plans, probably writing letters, sending off Timothy and Erastus to Macedonia, and perhaps making missionary expeditions in the neighborhood. This may have occupied three or four months longer, and made up a term of two years and six, seven, or eight months, which would quite justify the term τριετία. Every one. Each one separately, not merely the whole flock together. A weighty lesson for every one who has the cure of souls (comp. John 10:3). Night and day. The night is mentioned first, in accordance with Hebrew usage (Genesis 1:5, 8, 13, etc.; comp. the word νυχθήμερον in 2 Corinthians 11:25) St. Paul enforces the word \"Watch,\" so appropriate to shepherds who watch over their flocks by night (Luke 2:8), by his own example of admonishing by night as well as day.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Now for now brethren, A.V. and T.R.; the inheritance for an inheritance, A.V. and T.R.; that for which, A.V. I commend you to God (παρατίθεμαι ὑμᾶς). A most beautiful and significant phrase! The apostle is leaving for ever the flock which he had fed with such devoted care and loved with such a fervent love. He was leaving them with a strong impression of the dangers to which they would be exposed. To whom could he entrust them? to what loving hands could he consign them? He gives them to God, to take watchful custody of them. He brings them to him in the prayer of faith. He commits to him the precious deposit (παραθήκη), to be preserved safe unto the day of Christ. So the Savior of the world, when dying on the cross, said, \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit \"(Luke 23:46), and then trustingly gave up the ghost (see too Acts 14:23). No less beautiful are the words which follow: And to the word of his grace. He was thinking of the grievous wolves, and of their pernicious doctrine; of the deceivers that should arise, and their soul-destroying heresies; and so he turns to the one source of safety \"the Word of God's grace in Jesus Christ.\" If they are kept in that Word of truth, if they nourish their souls with that sincere milk, they will be safe. The gospel which he had preached would be their safety unto the end. It would build them up on the one Foundation which never can be moved; it would preserve them holy to take possession of the inheritance of the saints in light. The inheritance (τὴν κληρονομίαν); comp. Ephesians 1:14, 18; Ephesians 5:5; and Ephesians 1:11, ἐκληρώθημεν. In Acts 26:18 it is κλῆρον (as in Colossians 1:12), and the ἡγιασμένοι are further defined by the addition of πίστει,  ῞τῇ εἰς ἐμέ, \"by the faith which is in me\" (for the use of ἀγιάζεσθαι, comp. Hebrews 10:10, 14; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 1 Corinthians 6:11, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Coveted for have coveted, A V. Apparel. One of the items of an Oriental's treasure for the purpose of gifts (2 Kings 5:5, 22, 23, 26; Genesis 45:22; Matthew 6:19, 2(1). St. Paul contrasts his own example in not seeking such gifts with the conduct of the false apostles who draw away disciples after them for gain (1 Timothy 6:5-10; Romans 16:17, 18; comp. 1 Corinthians 9.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Ye for yea ye, A.V. and T.R.; ministered for have ministered, A.V.

In all things (πάντα, for κατὰ πάντα, 1.q. πάντως); altogether, in all respects. Gave you an example. The common use of ὑποδείκνυμι is, as rendered in the A.V., \"to show,\" \"to teach,\" as in Acts 9:16; Luke 6:47; and repeatedly in the LXX. But perhaps its force here is equivalent to the phrase in John 13:15, ὑπόδειγμα ε}δωκα ὑμῖν, \"I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you,\" as the R.V. takes it. So laboring; viz. as ye have seen me do. To help the weak. Meyer, following Bengel and others, understands this to mean the weak in faith,\" like ἀσθενής in 1 Corinthians 9:22. They say that St. Paul's self-denial in refusing the help he had a right to claim as an apostle, and supporting himself by his labor, was a great argument to convince the weak in faith of his disinterestedness and of the truth of his gospel, and so he recommends the elders of the Church to follow his example. But the word here is ἀσθενούντων, and ἀσθενεῖν and ἀσθενεία rather suggest the idea of bodily weakness (Matthew 25:36; Matthew 10:8, etc.; Luke 5:15, etc.), and the words of the Lord Jesus which follow suggest almsgiving to the needy. So that it is better to understand the word of the weakly and poor, those unable to work for themselves. Doubtless St. Paul, out of his scanty earnings, found something to give to the sick and needy. The sentiment in our text is thus exactly analogous to the precept in Ephesians 4:28. The very word there used, χερσίν, recalls the αἱ χεῖρες αὕται of ver. 34. To remember the words of the Lord Jesus. This is a solitary instance era saying of our Lord's, not recorded in the Gospels, being referred to in Scripture. There are many alleged sayings of Christ recorded in apocryphal Gospels or in the writings of Fathers as Papias and others (Routh, 'Reliq. Sac.,' 1:9, 10, 12), some of which may be authentic; but this alone is warranted by Scripture. How it came to St Paul's knowledge, and that of the Ephesian elders to whom he seems to have taken for granted that it was familiar, it is impossible to say. But it seems likely that, in those very early days, some of the Lord's unwritten words may have floated in the memory of men, and been preserved by word of mouth. Clement (1 Corinthians it.) seems to refer to the saying when he writes in praise of the former character of the Corinthians, that they were then ἥδιον διδόντες η} λομβάνοντες. But he probably had it from the Acts of the Apostles, as had the author of the 'Apostol. Constitut.' (4. 3, 1). Similar apophthegms are quoted from heathen writers, as those cited by Kuinoel: Δωρεῖσθαι καὶ διδόναι κρεῖττον η} λαμβάνειν (Artemidor., 'Onirocr.,' 4, 3); Μᾶλλόν ἐστὶ τοῦ ἐλευθέρου τὸ διδόναι οι{ς δεῖ ἠ λαμβάνειν ὕθεν δεῖ (Arist., 'Nieom.,' 4, 1), \"It is more becoming to a free man to give to whom he ought to give, than to receive from whom he ought to receive.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs20:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more.

But the rendering accompanied gives the meaning of the two last passages in the Acts better than that of the R.V. It is impossible to part with this most touching narrative, of such exquisite simplicity and beauty, without a parting word of admiration and thankfulness to God for having preserved to his Church this record of apostolic wisdom and faithfulness on the one hand, and of loving devotion of the clergy to their great chief on the other. As long as the stones of the Church are bound together by such strong mortar, it can defy the attacks of its enemies from without.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.21":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When it came to pass float we were parted from them, and had set sail for it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, A.V.; Cos for Coos, A.V. and T.R.; next day for day following, A.V. Parted from them (ἀποσπασθέντας). \"Non sine desiderio magno\" (Bengel). \"He shows the violence of the parting by saying, ' Having torn ourselves away '\" (Chrysostom). The word is properly applied to those who have been unwillingly torn away from their friends (Schleusner and Kuinoel); \"denotes the painful separation wrung from them by necessity\" (Meyer) In Acts 20:30 it was used in the active voice of false teachers \"drawing away\" the disciples, i.e. Christians, after them. In 2 Macc. 12:10 it means simply\" withdrawn,\" and so perhaps also in Luke 22:41, though Meyer thinks that St. Luke chose the unusual word to denote the urgent emotion by which our Lord was as it were compelled to leave the companionship of the apostles, and be alone. Σπᾶν (whence spasm) and its derivatives, of which Luke uses four - two of which are peculiar to him - are much employed by medical writers, as Hippocrates, Galen, Antaeus, etc. (Hobart, on Luke 22.). Had set sail (ἀναχθῆναι ἡμᾶς). The word means\" to go up to the sea from the land,\" as Luke 8:22; Acts 13:13; Acts 16:11; Acts 27:12; just as, on the contrary, κατάγειν and κατάγεσθαι αρε υσεδ of coming down to land from the sea (see ver. 3 in the T.R., and Acts 27:3; Acts 28:12). The same conception of putting out to sea being a going up, led to the phrase μετέωρος (high up) being applied to ships out at sea. From μετέωρος comes, of course, our word \"meteor.\" Cos, or Coos, for it is written both ways, now called by the Turks Stanko (ἐς τὰν Κῶ), a beautiful island, nearly opposite the Gulf of Halicarnassus, and separated from Cnidus by a narrow strait, about six hours' sail from Miletus. There is a city of the same name on its eastern coast. It was one of the six Dorian colonies which formed the confederation called the Dorian Hexapolis. It was famous for its wine and its textile fabrics (Howson, and Lewin, and 'Dict. of Geog.'). Rhodes (Ρόδος); perhaps the \"Isle of Roses;\" the well-known mountainous island in the AEgean Sea, which lies nine or ten miles from the coast of Carts. Its inhabitants were Dorians, and it was one of the places which claimed the honor of being the birthplace of Homer. The towns are all situated on the seacoast, \"Rhodes was the last Christian city to make a stand against the Saracens\" (Howson). Patara ([τὰ] Πάταρα). A flourishing commercial city on the south-west coast of Lycia, with a good harbor. It was the port of Xauthus, the capital of Lycia. The name Patera is still attached to some extensive ruins on the seashore not far from the river Xanthus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Having found a ship crossing for finding a ship sailing, A.V.; Phoenieia for Phenicia, A.V.; set sail for set forth, A.V. Having found a ship. The ship in which St. Paul and his companions had hitherto sailed was probably a coasting-vessel, intending to continue its course all along the south coast of Asia Minor. But at Patara they found a ship on the point of sailing across the open sea direct to Tyre, by which the voyage would be shortened many days. They accordingly immediately took their passage by it, and put out to sea (ἀνήχθημεν, ver. 1, note). A glance at the map will show what a great corner was thus cut off. A straight line from Patara to Tyro leaves Cyprus just on the left.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And for when, A.V.; come in sight of for discovered, A.V.; leaving it... we sailed for we left it... and sailed, A.V.; unto for into, A.V. Had come in sight of; literally, had been shown Cyprus; had had Cyprus made visible to us; i.e. had sighted Cyprus. It is a nautical expression. Meyer compares the phrase πεπίστευμαι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον for the grammatical construction. The verb ἀναφαίνω is peculiar to St. Luke, occur-tug elsewhere in the New Testament only in Luke 19:11. It is, however, used repeatedly in the LXX. of Job. Landed; κατήχθημεν, T.R., just the opposite to the ἀνήθημεν of ver. 2; but the R.T. has κατήλθομεν, with the same meaning, \"we came to shore.\" At Tyre, which they may have reached in about forty-eight hours from Patara with a fair wind (Howson). Tyre at this time was still a city of some commercial importance, with two harbors, one north and one south of the causeway which connected the island with the mainland (see Acts 12:20). Howson thinks the ship in which St. Paul sailed may have brought wheat from the Black Sea, and taken up Phoenician wares in exchange. The sight of Cyprus as he sailed by must have brought many and very various memories to the apostle's mind, of Barnabas, of Sergius Paulus, of Elymas, and many others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Having found the disciples for finding disciples, A.V. and T.R.; and these for who, A.V.; set foot in for go up to, A.V. and T.R. Having found the disciples, If the R.T. is right, the meaning is that they had sought out the Christians, apparently not a large body, scattered in the city, and perhaps with some difficulty found them and their place of meeting. This would look as if they were not Jews, as the synagogue was always known. He should not set foot in Jerusalem. The R.T. reads ἐπιβαίνειν for ἀναβαίνειν. It is true that, in the LXX. of Deuteronomy 1:36, Τὴν γῆν ἐφ η}ν ἐπέβη means \"The land that he hath trodden upon;\" and that in Joshua 1:3 again, ποδῶν ὑμῶν means \"Every place on which you shall tread with the sole of your feet;\" but the phrase ἐπιβαίνειν εἰς Ιερουσαλήμ must surely mean simply \"to go to Jerusalem.\" Through the Spirit. The Holy Spirit revealed to them, as he did to many ethers (ver. 11 and Acts 20:23), that bonds and affliction awaited St. Paul at Jerusalem. The inference that he should not go to Jerusalem was their own.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - It came to pass that we had accomplished for we had accomplished, A.V.; the days for those days, A.V.; on our journey for our way, A.V.; they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way for they all brought us on our way, with wires and children, A.V.; kneeling down on the beach we prayed for we kneeled down on the shore and prayed., A.V. and T.R. Accomplished the days. There is no other example of this use of the word ἐξαρτίζειν, which always means \"to fit out, to equip thoroughly,\" as e.g. Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 3. 2:2, where he speaks of soldiers τοῖς ἅπασι καλῶς ἐξηρτισμένους well equipped in all respects; and in the only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs, 2 Timothy 3:17, where it is rendered \"thoroughly furnished,\" or \"furnished completely.\" R.V. Hence some would render the passage here \"when we had refitted (the ship) during these days.\" But this is a very harsh construction, and it is better, with the glossaries, lexicons, the Vulgate, and most commentators, to take the word here in the unusual sense of \"to complete,\" applied to time. The days are the seven days mentioned in ver. 4, which were probably determined by the time it took to unlade the ship and get the new cargo on board.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - And bade each other farewell; and we went on board the ship, but, etc., for and when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and, etc., A.V. and T.R. The ἀπασπάζεσθαι of the R.T. occurs nowhere else, except in Himerius in the fourth century after Christ. Went on board; ἐπέβημες εἰς, the same phrase as ἐπιβαίνειν εἰς Ἱερουσαλήμ in ver. 5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The voyage for our course, A.V.; arrived at for came to, A.V.; we saluted for saluted, A.V. When we had finished; διανύσαντες, only found here in the New Testament, but not uncommon in classical Greek for finishing a voyage, or a journey, or a race-course (Euripides, Hesiod, Xenophon, etc.). St. Luke seems to indicate by the phrase that the sea-voyage ended here. Arrived at; κατηντήσαμεν, a favorite word of St. Luke's for arriving at a place (Acts 16:1; Acts 18:19, 24; Acts 20:15; Acts 25:13; Acts 27:12, etc.), Ptolemais. The ancient Accho of Judges 1:31, then a Canaanite city in the tribe of Asher, but not subsequently mentioned in the Old Testament. In 1 Macc. 5:15, 22 and elsewhere it is called, as here, Ptolemais, having received the name from one of the Ptolemies, probably either Sorer or Lagi; but in the Middle Ages it appears as St. Jean d'Acre, and is now commonly called Acre. It lies on the north side of the spacious bay of Carmel, but is not in all weathers very safe harborage. It is an easy day's sail, under thirty miles, from Tyre. When St. Paul was there it had recently been made a Roman colony by the Emperor Claudius, and was important as a commercial city. Saluted the brethren. The Christians there. We have no account of the evangelization of Ptolemais. Perhaps the gospel was first preached there to the Jewish colony by those who traveled \"as far as Phoenico,\" after \"the persecution that arose about Stephen\" (Acts 11:19); for Ptolemais was reckoned as belonging to Phenicia (Ptol., 5:15; Strabo, 16. p. 758; Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 5:17; all quoted by Meyer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - On the morrow for the next day A.V.; we for we that were of Paul's company, A.V. and T.R.; entering we for we entered... and, A.V.; who for which, A.V. Unto Caesarea. They seem to have come from Ptolemais to Caesarea by land, a two days' journey; the word. ἐξελθόντες, as Howson justly remarks, pointing to a land-journey. Philip the evangelist. When last we heard of him (Acts 8:40) he had just reached Caesarea; apparently he had been working there as an evangelist ever since. His old home at Jerusalem (Acts 6:5) had been broken up by the persecution (Acts 8:5), and thus the deacon had become an evangelist (Acts 8:12). Evangelists are mentioned by St. Paul(Ephesians 4:11) as one of the higher orders of the Christian ministry; and Timothy is bid \"do the work of an evangelist\" (2 Timothy 4:5). In later times the term was restricted to the four writers of the Gospels. Philip's old association with Stephen in the diaconate must have been keenly remembered by St. Paul. We abode with him. This seems to imply that Philip was well to do, and had a good house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Now this man for and the same man, A.V. Virgins. This certainly conveys the impression that they had dedicated their lives to the service of God (1 Corinthians 7:34-38). Which did prophesy. The question arises - Did they exercise their gift of prophecy in the Church or in private? The passage 1 Corinthians 11:5 seems to indicate that in the Church of Corinth women did pray and prophesy in the congregation, while, on the other hand, 1 Corinthians 14:34, 35 seems peremptorily to forbid women to speak or teach in Church, as does 1 Timothy 2:11, 12. How, then, is this apparent contradiction to be reconciled? It must be either by supposingNEWLINENEWLINE(1) that the gift of prophecy spoken of here and in 1 Corinthians 11:5 was exercised in private only; orNEWLINENEWLINE(2) that the prohibition did not apply to the extraordinary operation of the Holy Spirit speaking by prophet or prophetesses as the case might be. The latter seems the most probable (see Acts 13:1, note). On the office of prophets in the early Church, see Acts 11:27; Acts 13:1; Acts 15:32; Acts 19:6; Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29; 1 Corinthians 13:2, 8; 1 Corinthians 14:6, 29, etc.; Ephesians 3:5; Ephesians 4:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:20 (see Alford, on Acts 11:27). As regards these daughters of Philip, there are conflicting statements in early Church writers. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 3:30) quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that both Peter and Philip among the apostles were married and had children, and that Philip moreover gave his daughters in marriage to husbands. But in the next chapterNEWLINENEWLINE(3) he quotes Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus at the end of the second century, as saying that Philip the apostle and his two daughters, who had grown old in their virginity, were buried at Hierapolis; and that another daughter of his, \"who had her conversation in the Holy Spirit,\" was buried at Ephesus. Eusebius himself thinks that these daughters of Philip the evangelist were meant. If they were, it does not necessarily follow that those who, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, were married were of the four mentioned here. They might be sisters. Polycrates seems to speak of three sisters who lived a religious life (in the technical sense); the fourth may have died young. But it is quite possible that Clemens may really be speaking of Philip the apostle, and Polycrates also; the more so as Philip the apostle, according to the tradition recorded by Nicephorns, suffered martyrdom at Hierapolis. However, the confusion between the two Philips is quite certain in the Menaeum (or Calendar) of the Greek Church, where we read, \"On the 4th of September is the commemoration of Saint Hermione, one of the four daughters of the Apostle Philip, who baptized the eunuch of Candace. She and her sister Eutychis came into Asia after the death of the Apostle John. She was buried at Ephesus.\" A fragment of Caius (in Eusebius, 'Eccl. Hist.,' 3:31) increases the confusion by speaking of\" the four daughters of Philip, prophetesses, who were buried in Hierapolis\" (see Routh's 'Reliq. Sac.,' vol. 1. pp. 378-380).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Many days (ἡμέρας πλείους). In Acts 13:31 ἐπὶ ἡμέρας πλείους is applied to the forty days between the Resurrection and the Ascension. In Acts 18:20 πλείονα χρόνον is a longer time - longer, viz. than he had intended. In Acts 25:6 ἡμέρας πλείους η} δέκα is \"more than ten days.\" Here, therefore, it is too strong an expression to say \"many days.\" According to Lewin's calculation, he was only five days at Caesarea - from May 10 to May 15. Howson's \"some days,\" which is the rendering also in the margin of the R.T., is much better than \"many.\" Renan has \"quelques jours.\" Agabus (see Acts 11:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Coming to for when he was come unto, A.V.; and taking for he took, A.V.; he bound for and bound, A.V.; feet and hands for hands and feet, A.V. and T.R. Bound his own feet, etc. The R.T. has ἑαυτοῦ which leaves no doubt that Agabus bound his own hands and feet. The reading of the T.R., αὐτοῦ, would rather indicate Paul's hands and feet, as Grotius, Hammond, and others take it, though less conformably to the context. (For similar symbolical actions of the old prophets, see Isaiah 20:2, 3; Jeremiah 13:1-7; 1 Kings 22:11; Ezekiel 4:1-6; Ezekiel 12:3-7; Ezekiel 24:16-24, etc.) Shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. Nearly the same words as those in which our Lord foretold his own betrayal (Matthew 20:19; Mark 10:33; Luke 18:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They of that place; οἱ ἐντόπιοι, a word found only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. or the Apocrypha, but good classical Greek (for the sentiment, see ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? A.V. (the same sense only a more modern idiom). Breaking. Συνθρύπτοντες occurs only here in the New Testament, or indeed in any Greek writer, though the simple form, θρύπτω, is common in medical writers, and ἀποθρύπτω occurs in Plato. It has the force of the Latin frangere animum, to crush and weaken the spirit. I am ready. Paul's answer reminds us of Peter's saying to our Lord, \"Lord, I am ready to go with thee both into prison, and to death\" (Luke 22:33). But Peter's resolve was made in his own strength, Paul's in the strength of the Holy Ghost; and so the one was broken, and the other was kept.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The will of the Lord, etc. A beautiful application of the petition in the Lord's prayer, \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\" (comp. Luke 22:42).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - These for those, A.V.; baggage for carriages, A.V. We took up, etc. Απισκευασάμενοι, is the reading of the R.T., as of Mill, Bengel, Griesbach, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Meyer, Alford, etc. It occurs only here in the New Testament, but is common in classical Greek, in the sense of \"fitting out for a journey,\" \"lading a ship\" or \"beasts of burden\" with baggage, \"collecting baggage,\" and the like. The ἀποσκευάζεσθαι of the A.V. means\" to unload,\" \"to get rid of baggage,\" and thence generally \"to remove,\" which gives no good sense here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And there went for there went, A.V.; from for of, A.V.; bringing for and brought, A.V.; early for old, A.V. Mnason of Cyprus; only mentioned here. He may very probably be one of those Cypriots mentioned in Acts 11:19, 20, and so have been a disciple before the death of Stephen, and hence properly called an old or early disciple. If he had been one of St. Paul's converts in the visit to Cyprus recorded in Acts 13, St. Paul would have needed no introduction to him. The construction of the sentence is involved, and the exact meaning consequently obscure. Kuincel, Meyer, Howson (in 'Dict. of Bible'), and many more, translate it \"conducting us to Mnason,\" etc., which seems the better translation; not, however, so as to make ἄγειν Μνάσωνι equivalent to ἄγειν πρὸς Μνάσωνα, which Greek usage will not admit of, but explaining the dative by attraction of the relative ω΅ι, which is governed by παρὰ. If it had not been for the intervening παρ ω΅ι ξενισθῶμεν, the sentence would have run ἄγοντες πρὸς τὸν Μνάσωνα, κ.τ.λ. If Mnason, who, consistently with Acts 11:19, had a house at Jerusalem, had been at Caesarea at this time, it would be quite unmeaning that disciples from Caesarea should bring Mnason with them. The sentence would rather have run \"among whom was Mnason,\" etc. But if he was at Jerusalem, it was quite proper that any Christians of Caesarea who knew him should conduct Paul to his house, and introduce him and his party to him. Mnason, like Philip (ver. 6, note), was evidently a man of substance, Should lodge; should be hospitably entertained (Hebrews 13:2; 1 Peter 4:9; see Acts 10:6, 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Went in with us unto James. Nothing can mark more distinctly the position of James as Bishop of Jerusalem than this visit of Paul to him, and the finding him surrounded with all the elders of Jerusalem. It is a most distinct evidence of the apostolic origin of the episcopal office.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Rehearsed one by one for declared particularly, A.V.; the things which for what things, A.V. The things which God had wrought, etc. (comp. Acts 15:12). It was a noble account to render. Since he had saluted the Church (Acts 18:22), when he had probably seen James last, he had labored at Antioch, in Galatia and Phrygia, and had wrought a mighty revolution in Asia. He had consolidated his work in Macedonia and Achaia; he had held his visitation of Gentile eiders in Miletus; he had visited Tyre, Ptolemais, and Caesarea, great Gentile cities, and had seen everywhere astonishing tokens of the grace of God which was with him. And now he pours his tale into the ears of the chief pastor of the mother Church of Jerusalem, and those of the Jewish elders. A tale of wonder indeed!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - They, when they heard it for when they heard it, they, A.V.; God for the Lord, A.V. and T.R.; they said for said, A.V.; there are among the Jews of them which have believed for of Jews there are which believe, A.V. and T.R.; for the Law for of the Law, A.V. They... glorified God. There is not the slightest symptom on the part of James and the elders of unfriendliness towards St. Paul, or jealousy or opposition to his work among the Gentiles (comp. Galatians 2:7-9). The appellation brother is another indication of friendly feeling. Thousands (Greek μυριάδες, tens of thousands). These need not be deemed to be all Jerusalem Jews; if applied to the Church at Jerusalem only, such a word would be probably a gross exaggeration; but there were great numbers of Jews of the dispersion assembled at Jerusalem for Pentecost - probably all the Christian Jews of Judaea, and many from Syria, Galatia, Pontus, and the various countries enumerated in Acts 2:9-11. So that there might be several myriads of converted Jews altogether. All zealous for the Law. This is a remarkable testimony to the unanimity of the Christian Jews in their attachment to the Law of Moses, and throws light upon the Epistle to the Galatians and many other passages in St. Paul's Epistles. It explains the great difficulty experienced in the early Church in dealing with converts from Judaism. Zealous (ζηλωταὶ). So the fierce sect of Zealots were called at the time of the Jewish wars (see Josephus, ' Bell. Jud.,' 4. 6:1, and elsewhere).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Have been for are, A.V.; concerning for of, A.V.; telling them not for saying that they ought not, A.V. Have been informed (κατηχήθησαν); see Acts 18:25; Luke 1:4; Romans 2:18, etc. The verb properly means to instruct by word of mouth, whence our \"catechism.\" The customs (τοῖς ἔθεσι); see Acts 6:14, both for the phrase and the sentiment, and Acts 15:1, note; Acts 26:3; 28:17.

As regards the transaction recommended by James, Kypke (quoted by Meyer) says, \"It was a received thing among the Jews, and was reckoned an act of eminent piety, for a rich man to undertake to bear, on behalf of poor Nazarites, the expense of those sacrifices which they had to offer when they shaved their heads at the expiration of their vow.\" Josephus seems to allude to the custom, and to speak of King Agrippa as acting in accordance with it, when he says of him that he ordered great numbers of Nazarites to be shaved ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 6:1). The sacrifices were costly, consisting of\" three beasts, one for a burnt offering, another for a sin offering, and a third for a peace offering\" (Lightfoot, vol. 9. p. 307). Alexander Jannaeus is said to have contributed nine hundred victims for three hundred Nazarites ('Dict. of Bible,' under \"Nazarite;\" comp. 1 Macc. 3:49). Purify thyself; ἁγνίσθητι, the word used in the LXX. of Numbers 6:2, 3, 8 (with its compound ἁφαγνίσασθαι, and co-derivatives ἁγνεία and ἅγιος) for the corresponding Hebrew הַזִּיד, to take the Nazarite vow. St. Paul, therefore, became a Nazarite of days for seven days, intending at the end of the time to offer the prescribed sacrifices for himself and his four companions (see, however, note on ver. 26, at the end). Be at charges for them (δαπάνησον ἐπ αὐτοῖς). Make the necessary expenditure on their account, that they may shave their heads, which they could not do till the prescribed sacrifices were offered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But as for as, A.V.; have believed for believe, A.V.; wrote giving judgment for have written and concluded, A.V.; the R.T. omits the clause rendered that they observe no such thing, save only, in the A.V.; should keep for keep, A.V.; sacrificed for offered, A.V.; what is strangled for strangled, A.V. As touching the Gentiles, etc. What follows is, of course, a quotation from \"the decrees that had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem\" (Acts 16:4), of which the text is given in Acts 15:19, 20, 28. Observe the use of the identical words - κρίνω, in Acts 15:19; Acts 16:4; and in this verse; and of ἐπιστέλλω, in this verse and in Acts 15:20, with its cognate διεστειλάμεθα and ἀπεστάλκαμεν, Acts 15:24, 27. This reference on the part of James to the decrees was very important as a confirmation of \"the gospel which Paul preached among the Gentiles\" (Galatians 2:2). It also marks distinctly the upright and honorable conduct of James, and the concord of the apostles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Went for entered, A.V.; declaring the fulfillment for to signify the accomplishment, A.V.; the offering was for that an offering should be, A.V. Paul took the men. St. Paul's acquiescence in James's advice is an instance of what he says of himself (1 Corinthians 9:20), and is in accordance with his conduct in circumcising Timothy (Acts 16:3). But that he did not attach any intrinsic importance even to circumcision, and much less to the minor Jewish ceremonies, is clear from such passages as Romans 2:28, 29; 1 Corinthians 7:19; Galatians 5:6; Galatians 6:15; Philippians 3:3, etc. Purifying himself with them, etc. (ἁγνισθεὶς); see note on ver. 24. James's advice had been Τούτους παραλαβὼν ἁγνίσθητι σὺν αὐτοῖς: in obedience to that advice St. Paul now Παραλαβὼν τοὺςἄνδρας σὺν αὐτοῖς ἁγνισθεὶς εἰσήει εἰς τὸ ἱερόν. What was the particular form by which a person who wished to associate himself with others under a Nazaritic vow (note on ver. 24) did so is not known; nor how long before the expiration of the vow such association must be made. But from the mention of \"seven days\" in ver. 27 (which is the number named in Numbers 6:9, in case of an accidental uncleanness), it seems highly probable that \"seven days\" was the term during which a person must have conformed to the Nazaritic vow to entitle him to \"be at charges,\" as well, perhaps, as the time during which Nazarites, at the end of their vow, had to undergo special purification. Declaring the fulfillment, etc. The vow of the four men had been for at least thirty days (the minimum period of such vow); but whatever length of time it had been for, such time would have expired by the end of the seven days, and probably long before. We know not how long they might have been waiting for some one to \"be at charges\" for them, and provide the sacrifices, without which they could not shave their heads and accomplish their vow. But it is obvious that some notice must be given to the priests in the temple of the day when one or more Nazarites would present themselves at \"the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,\" to offer the prescribed offerings. And this accordingly Paul and the four did. Διαγγέλλων means \"notifying,\" or \"declaring,\" to the priests (Exodus 9:16 [LXX., answering to the Hebrew סַפֵּר]; Romans 9:27; Joshua 6:9, LXX. [Joshua 6:10, A.V., \"bid\"]). Until the offering was offered, etc. This is interpreted in two ways. Meyer makes \"until\" depend upon \"the fulfillment of the days,\" so as to define that fulfillment as not taking place till the offering was offered. Wieseler makes \"until\" depend upon \"he entered into the temple,\" with the idea supplied, \"and remained there,\" or \"came there daily;\" supposing that it was the custom for Nazarites to finish up their time of separation by passing the last seven days, or at least being present daily, in \"the court of the women, where was the apartment appropriated to the Nazarites\" (Lewin, it. p. 142). If, however, with Howson, Lewin and others, we understand the word ἀγνίζεσθαι, in vers. 24 and 20, not generally of taking the Nazarite vow, but of certain special purifications at the close of a Nazaritic vow, which lasted seven days immediately before the offerings were made and the head shaven, then a very easy and natural rendering of the words follows: \"Notifying their intention of now completing the seven days of their purification, until the offering for each of them was offered.\" Alford, in loc., justifies by examples the aorist indicative προσηνέχθη, instead of the subjunctive, which is more usual. Lewin thinks that St. Paul had taken a Nazaritic vow after his escape from death at Ephesus, or at Corinth; but there is no evidence of this, and it is hardly consistent with James's advice. Renan thinks it doubtful whether or no Paul took the Nazaritic vow at all, but inclines to this as the best interpretation ('St. Paul,' p. 518, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Completed for ended, A.V.; from for which were of, A.V.; multitude for people, A.V.

This shows also that \"the days\" in the preceding verse meant the \"seven days\" of preparation rather than \"the days\" of the whole Nazaritic vow. The Jews from Asia; come up for Pentecost. How hostile the Asiatic Jews were appears from Acts 19:9. When they saw him in the temple, whither he had come to complete the seven days of preparation. It was apparently the fifth day (see Acts 24:11, note). How often the best meant attempts at conciliation fail through the uncharitable suspicions of a man's opponents! The temple. It must be remembered throughout that it is τὸ ἱερόν that is spoken of, which embraces the temple courts, not the ναός, or house (see Acts 3:2, note). Stirred up. Συγχέω ισ found only here in the New Testament. Properly \"to confuse,\" like the kindred συγχύνω (Acts 2:6; Acts 19:32; Acts 21:31); and σύγχυσις, confusion (Acts 19:29); hence \"to stir up.\" It is of frequent use in medical writers (Hobart, 79.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCrying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Moreover he for further brought, A.V.; defiled for polluted, A.V.

The ἱερόν, which is often used in a wider sense of the whole area, is here restricted to the ἅγιον (see Acts 3:1, note). But the accusation was utterly false, the offspring of their own fanatical suspicions.

They turned Paul out of the ἱερόν, intending to kill him, and shut the doors, lest, in the confusion and the swaying to and fro of the crowd, the precincts of the temple should chance to be defiled with blood, or even with the presence of any who were unclean (see the passages from Josephus, quoted by Lewin, vol. it. p. 142, note 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Were seeking for went about, A.V.; up to for unto, A.V.; confusion for an uproar, A.V. Tidings; φάσις, only here in the New Testament. The legal use of the word in Greek is an \"information\" against any one laid before a magistrate. Here it is the information conveyed to the tribune by the sentinels on guard (Lange; see Hist. of Susanna 55). Came up; viz. to the castle of Antonia, to which steps led up from the temple area on the north-west side (see vers. 32 and 35). The chief captain; the chiliarch, or tribune; literally, the commander of a thousand men (see John 18:12). The band (τῆς σπείρης); the cohort which formed the Roman garrison of Antonia (see Acts 10:1, note; also vers. 32, 33, etc.; Acts 22:24, 26, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And forthwith he for who immediately, A.V.; upon for unto, A.V.; and they, when, etc., left off for and when they, etc., they left, A.V.; beating for beating of, A.V. Ran down upon (κατέδραμεν ἐπὶ). Κατατρέχω only occurs here in the New Testament, but is used in the LXX. of 1 Kings 19:20, followed by ὀπίσω, to run after. In classical Greek it governs an accusative or genitive of the person or thing attacked. Here the force of κατά seems to be merely the running down from the castle of Antonia, and therefore the A.V. unto seems preferable to the R.V. upon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Laid hold on for took, A.V.; inquired for. demanded, A.V. Laid hold on (ἐπελάβετο); see Acts 17:19, note. Bound with two chains; as St. Peter was (Acts 12:6). Ἄλυσις means properly \"a chain on the hands\" as opposed to πέδη, a fetter (Mark 5:4); and therefore the two chains are not to be understood of chains on his hands and feet, with Kuinoel, but, as in the case of Peter, of chains fastening him to a soldier on both hands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Shouted for cried, A.V. and T.R.; crowd for multitude, A.V.; uproar for tumult, A.V.; brought for carried, A.V. The certainty. He could not get at the truth because of the tumult and the different accounts given first by one and then by another. The Greek word τὸ ἀσφαλές, and its kindred ἀσφαλεία ἀσφαλῶς ἀσφαλίζω, and ἐπισφαλής, are of frequent use by St. Luke (Acts 2:36; Acts 5:23; Acts 16:23, 24; Acts 22:30; Acts 25:26; Acts 27:9; Luke 1:4). These words are all very much used by medical writers, and specially the last (ἐπισφαλής), which is used by St. Luke alone in the New Testament. The castle (τὴν παρεμβολήν), \"the camp or barracks attached to the tower of Antonia\" (Alford); Acts 22:24; Acts 23:10, 16, 32. It means the castle-yard within the fortifications, with whatever buildings were in it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Crowd for people, A.V. Borne of the soldiers. Lifted off his legs and carried up the steps. The stairs from the temple area at the northwest corner to the castle of Antonia (see ver. 31, note, and ver. 32). Alford quotes the description of the fort Antonia in Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:8, in which he says (Traill's translation), \"Its general appearance was that of a tower with other towers at each of the four corners. That at the southeast angle rose to an elevation of seventy cubits, so that from thence there was a complete view of the temple. Where it adjoined the colonnades of the temple it had passages leading down to both, through which the guards - for in the fortress there always lay a Roman legion - descended and disposed themselves about the colonnades in arms at the festivals, to watch the people, and repress any insurrectionary movement.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Crying out for crying, A.V. Away with him.

About to be brought into the castle. He had nearly reached the top of the stairs, and there was, perhaps, a brief halt while the gates of the castle-yard were being opened. Paul seized the opportunity to address Lysias in Greek. Dost thou know Greek? (Ἑλληνιστὶ γινώσκεις;). According to some, λαλεῖν is to be understood, \"Dost thou know how to speak Greek?\" after the analogy of Λαλοῦντες Ἀζωτιστί, and Οὐκ εἰσὶν ἐπιγινώσκοντες λαλεῖν Ιουδαι'στί, in Nehemiah 13:24. But others (Meyer, Alford, etc.) say that there is no ellipse of λαλεῖν, but that Ἐλληνιστὶ γινώσκειν Συριστὶ ἐπισταμένους (Xenophon), \"Graece nescire\" (Cicero), mean to know or not to know the Greek and Syrian languages.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTArt not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Art thou not then the for art not thou that, A.V.; stirred up to sedition for madest an uproar, A.V.; led for leddest, A.V.; the four thousand men of the Assassins for four thousand men that were murderers, A.V. Art thou not then, etc.? or as Meyer, \"Thou art not then;\" either way implying that Lysias had concluded that he was the Egyptian, but had now discovered his mistake. The Egyptian, etc. He whom Josephus calls (' Bell. Jud.,' it. 13:5) \"the Egyptian false prophet,\" and relates that, having collected above thirty thousand followers, he advanced from the desert to the Mount of Olives, intending to overpower the Roman garrison and make himself tyrant of Jerusalem, with the help of his δορυφόροι, or body-guard, who might very probably be composed of the Assassins or Sicarii, mentioned in the text. Stirred up to sedition (ἀναστατώσας) The difference between the A.V. and the R.V. is that the former takes the verb in an intransitive sense, \"to make an Uproar,\" the latter in a transitive sense, governing the \"four thousand men.\" In the only two other places were it occurs in the New Testament (Acts 17:6; Galatians 5:12) it is transitive. It is not a classical word. The four thousand men. Josephus, in the above-cited passage, reckons the followers of the Egyptian impostor at above thirty thousand. But such discrepancies are of no account, partly because of the known looseness with which numbers are stated, and Josephus's disposition to exaggerate; partly because of the real fluctuation in the numbers of insurgents at different periods of an insurrection; and partly because it is very possible that a soldier like Lysias would take no count of the mere rabble, but only of the disciplined and armed soldiers such as these Sicarii were. It may be added that Josephus himself seems to distinguish between the rabble and the fighting men, because, though in the 'Bell. Jud.,' it. 13:5 he says that Felix attacked or took prisoners \"most of his followers,\" in the 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:6 he makes the number of slain \"four hundred,\" and of prisoners \"two hundred\" - a very small proportion of thirty thousand. The Egyptian had premised his deluded followers that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down like those of Jericho. It is not known exactly in what year the insurrection took place, but it was, as Renan says, \"pen de temps auparavant\" ('St. Paul,' p. 525). The Egyptian himself contrived to run away and disappear; hence the thought that he was the author of this new tumult at Jerusalem. The Sicarii were a band of fanatical murderers, who, in the disturbed times preceding the destruction of Jerusalem, went about armed with daggers, and in broad daylight and in the public thoroughfares murdered whoever was obnoxious to them. Among others they murdered the high priest Jonathan at the instigation of Felix (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 6:7; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2, 13:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs21:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - I am a Jew for I am a man which am a Jew, A.V.; in for a city in, A.V.; give me leave for suffer me, A.V.

Thus e.g. the oration of Gorgias entitled, Υπὲρ Παλαμήδους ἀπολογία, begins, Ἡ μὲν κατηγορία καὶ ἡ ἀπολογία κρίσις οὐ περὶ θανάτου γίγνεται. And Demosthenes opposes κατηγρσεῖν to accuse, to ἀπολογεῖσθαι, to make one's defense. And an ἀπολογία δικαία καὶ ἁπλῆ is to prove that τὰ κατηγορημένα, \"the things of which the person is accused,\" were never done. But it is probably from St. Paul's use of the word here that it became common to call the defenses of the Christian religion by the term ἀπολογία. Thus we have the 'Apologies' of Justin Martyr, of Tertullian, of Minutius Felix, among the ancients; me 'Apologia Ecclesiae Anglicanae,' by Bishop Jewel, and many others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Unto them in the Hebrew language for in the Hebrew tongue to them, A.V.; were the more quiet for kept the more silence, A.V. When they heard, etc. This trait is wonderfully true to nature, and exhibits also St. Paul's admirable tact and self-possession. It was strikingly in harmony with his addressing them as \"brethren\" that he should speak to them in their own mother tongue. There is a living reality in such touches which seems at once to refute Renan's suspicion that St. Luke invented this and other of St. Paul's speeches in the later chapters of the Acts. The full report of these later speeches is abundantly accounted for by the fact that through this time St. Luke was with St. Paul, and heard the speeches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A Jew for verily a man which am a Jew, A.V. and T.R.; of Cilicia for a city in Cilicia, A.V.; but for yet, A.V.; instructed for and taught, A.V.; strict for perfect, A.V.; our for the, A.V.; being for and was, A.V.; for for towards, A.V.; even as for as, A.V.

St. Paul's express assertion that he was \"born at Tarsus\" directly refutes the tradition handed down by St. Jerome that he was horn at Giscala, and carried thence to Tarsus by his parents when Giscala was taken by the Romans (Farrar, ibid.).

The word occurs in the New Testament only here and Acts 26:11, but is not infrequent in the LXX. and in classical writers; τιμωρεῖν is common in medical language in the sense of \"to treat medically,\" to \"correct\" by medical treatment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Drew nigh for was come nigh, A.V. The phraseology of the following narrative is nearly identical with that of Acts 9:3-6 (where see notes).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I answered, Who art thou, Lord?

Beheld indeed the light [and were afraid, A.V.]. This corresponds with the statement in Acts 9:7, that the men who journeyed with Saul \"stood speechless.\" They were dazzled and amazed at the sudden brightness. But they heard not the voice. This at first sight seems inconsistent with the statement in Acts 9:7, \"hearing the voice.\" But the apparent inconsistency disappears when we observe that here St. Paul wished to impress upon his hearers that, though his companions had seen the light, they had not heard the words which were addressed to him by the Lord Jesus (see ver. 14); whereas St. Luke, in the narrative in Acts 9, wished rather to insist upon the fact that though the men had seen the light and heard the sound of the voice, they had not seen Jesus. To see and hear the risen Christ was a privilege given to St. Paul alone.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said, What shall I do, Lord?

Acts 9:8, and note). Them that were with me (τῶν συνόντων μοι). Συνεῖναι occurs only here and Luke 9:18, but is used several times by the LXX. It is very common in medical waters for the accompanying symptoms of a disease.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Well reported of by for having a good report of, A.V.; that for which, A.V.

Hath appointed thee; προεχειρίσατό σε, a word found in the New Testament only here and in Acts 26:16, and in Acts 3:20 (R.T.). In classical Greek it means mostly \"to get anything ready beforehand;\" to cause anything to be πρόχειρος, ready to hand. And in the LXX. it means \"to choose,\" or \"appoint,\" as Joshua 3:12; Exodus 4:13, where it is not a translation of שְׁלַח, but a paraphrase of the sentence, \"Appoint one by whom thou wilt send.\" Here it may be rendered indifferently either \"choose\" or \"appoint.\" The Righteous One. The designation of Messiah in such passages as Isaiah 53:11; Psalm 72:2, etc. (see in the New Testament Luke 23:47; 1 John 2:1; Revelation 19:11, etc.). A voice from his mouth is a very awkward though literal rendering. The A.V. expresses the sense much better.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A witness for him for his witness, A.V. A witness. An essential attribute of an apostle (see Acts 1:8, 22, notes). Seen and heard (comp. 1 John 1:1-3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - His Name for the Name of the Lord, A.V. and T.R. Wash away thy sins; ἀπόλουσαι, only here and in 1 Corinthians 6:11, where it is found in exactly the same sense of \"washing away sins\" (see vers. 9, 10) in holy baptism. Hence the λουτρὸν παλιγγενεσίας, \"the washing of regeneration\" (Titus 3:5; comp. Ephesians 5:26; and see Acts 2:38, note). Calling on his Name (ἐπικαλεσάμενος); see Acts 2:21; Acts 7:59, note; Acts 9:14, 21; Romans 10:12, 13, 14; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 2 Timothy 2:22: 1 Peter 1:17, all texts distinctly justifying prayer to the Lord Jesus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Had returned for was come again, A.V.; and for even, A.V.; fell into for was in, A.V.

Get thee quickly, etc. The narrative in Acts 9:28-30 does not mention the vision, but gives the murderous opposition of the Hellenist Jews as the reason of Saul's departure from Jerusalem to Tarsus. Possibly, if it had not been for the Divine warning, the apostle would have braved the danger and lost his life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They themselves for they, A.V. In every synagogue. It appears from Matthew 10:18 that offenders were beaten in the synagogue, and doubtless by command of the synagogue authorities. A delation to any synagogue that any member of it was a blasphemer (i.e. a Christian) would lead to such a punishment. But probably the meaning here rather is that he went or sent to every synagogue to find out who there was among them that believed in Jesus, and then had them punished at Jerusalem (Acts 9:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Stephen thy witness for thy martyr Stephen, A.V.; consenting for consenting unto his death, A.V. and T.R.; keeping the garments for kept the raiment, A.V. Consenting; συνευδοκῶν (above, Acts 8:1; Luke 11:48; Romans 1:32; 1 Corinthians 7:12, 13). It is also found in 1 Macc. 1:60; 2 Macc. 11:34, 35. Of them that slew him (τῶν ἀναιρούν των αὐτόν). Ἀναιρέω, in the sense of \"to kill,\" is a favorite word of St. Luke's (Luke 22:2; Luke 23:32; Acts 2:23; Acts 5:33, 36; Acts 7:28; Acts 9:23, 24, 29; Acts 10:39; Acts 12:2; Acts 13:28; Acts 16:27; Acts 22:20; Acts 23:15, 21, 27; Acts 25:3; Acts 26:10); but elsewhere in the New Testament only Matthew 2:16 and 2 Thessalonians 2:8, R.T. It is frequent in the LXX. and also in medical writers in the sense of \"taking away\" or \"removing.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Send thee forth for send thee, A.V. The natural understanding of the preceding dialogue is that Saul, when bid depart quickly out of Jerusalem because the Jews would not receive his testimony, was unwilling to obey, and pleaded that surely the Jews must listen to him and be convinced, since they were well aware how hot and zealous a partisan of the Jews he had been, and must see that nothing but a great miracle could have converted him. It was the argument of a young and impetuous man, with little experience of the headstrong obstinacy of bigoted men. The Lord cut him short with a peremptory \"Depart!\" but with the gracious addition, \"I will send thee unto the Gentiles\" - a commission which is more fully given in Acts 26:17, 18, and which was carried out in his whole life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - They for then, A.V.; voice for voices, A.V. Unto this word. They could not bear the idea of the Gentiles being admitted into the kingdom of God. It was a blow to their pride of exclusiveness. The leveling-up of the Gentiles seemed to be as intolerable as the leveling-down of themselves, as spoken of e.g. Isaiah 1:10; Ezekiel 16:45, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Threw off their garments for east off their clothes, A.V.; east for threw, A.V. Threw off their garments. Either \"wild signs of fury, gestures by which they gave to understand that they would gladly accomplish the cry, 'Away with him from the earth!'\" (Lunge), tokens of applause and consent at the sentiment of the cry (see the passages quoted by Kuinoel, Τὴν ἐσθῆτα ἀνασείων ἐκρότει τὸν Προαιρέσιον \"The proconsul applauded Proairesius the rhetorician by shaking his purple robe,\" Eunapius, 'Life of the Emperor Julian;' \"The whole theatre raved together, and leaped, and shouted, and threw off their garments (τὰς ἐσθῆτας ἀπεῥῤίπτουν),\" Lucian, ' De Salt,'); or (so Meyer) signifying that they were ready to stone the culprit (see ver. 20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Bidding for and bade, A.V.; for what cause for wherefore, A.V.; so shouted for cried so, A.V. The chief captain (see Acts 21:31, note). The castle (see Acts 21:34, note). Examined; ἀνετάζεσθαι, only here and in ver. 29. In Judges 6:29 (Codex Alexandrinus) and in the Hist. of Susanna 14 the verb has the simple sense of \"inquiring.\" The classical word for \"examining\" and especially by torture, is ἐξετάζειν. By scourging (μάστιξιν). The μάστιξ was in Latin the flagellum, the m st severe implement of flogging, though even with the lighter virga, the rod of the lictor, slaves and others were beaten to death (usque ad necem). It was not lawful to beat a Roman citizen even with the virga (ῤάβδος); Acts 16:22, 35, 37, notes. The μάστιξ, or scourge, was that with which our Lord was scourged at the bidding of Pilate (Matthew 27:26, where φραγελλώσας is from the Latin flagellum; Mark 10:34; Luke 18:33; John 19:1). Doubtless Lysias had not understood Paul's Hebrew speech, and so had not known what it was which provoked so fierce an uproar among the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - When they had tied him up with the thongs for as they bound him with thongs, A.V. When they had tied him up, etc. This does not seem to be a right rendering. Προτείνω can only mean \"to stretch out before,\" or \"expose to the action,\" of anything, when taken in a literal sense; ἱμάς, again, more naturally means the \"thong\" or lash of a whip or scourge than a thong to bind a man with; indeed, it is thought to be etymologically connected with μάστιξ, Meyer, therefore, rightly understands the passage to mean when they had stretched him on the stake ready to receive the scourging. Is it lawful, etc.? Paul now pleads his privileges as a Roman citizen, just in time to stop the outrage, remembering, no doubt, the terror inspired in the Philippian magistrates when they found they had beaten with rods an uncondemned Roman citizen (see Acts 16:38). Uncondemned (ἀκατακρίτους); Acts 16:37. Only found in these two passages in the New Testament, and nowhere else.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - And when for when, A.V.; it for that, A.V.; to for and told, A.V.; and told him, saying for saying, A.V.; What art thou about to do? for Take heed what thou doest, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman?

The word is only found here in the New Testament in the sense of a \"sum of money,\" but is so used in classical writers. Citizenship; πολιτεία, for \"freedom of the city,\" in Xenophon, AElian, Polybius, Dion Cassius, etc., and 3Macc. 3:21. Dion Cassius (9 17) relates that Messaliua, the wife of the Emperor Claudius, used to sell the freedom of the city, and that at first she sold it (μεγάλων ξρημάτων) for a very high price, but that afterwards it became very cheap. In all probability Lysias had so purchased it, and in consequence took the name of Claudius (Renan, ' St. Paul,' p. 524). I am a Roman born. It is not known how St. Paul's family acquired the Roman citizenship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs22:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - They then which were about to examine him straightway departed from him for then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him, A.V.; when for after, A.V.

It governs a dative here, as in Acts 3:12; Acts 10:1; Acts 14:9; Luke 4:20; Luke 22:56; elsewhere it is followed by εἰς. Brethren. He emits here the \"fathers\" which he added in Acts 22:1. If there is any special significance in the omission, it may be that he meant now to assume a less apologetic tone, and to speak as an equal to equals. Howson and Lewin think that he spoke as being, or having been, himself a member of the Sanhedrim. But he may have meant merely a friendly address to his countrymen. I have lived, etc. πεπολέτευμαι τῷ Θεῷ); comp. Philippians 3:20; I have had my conversation (vitam degi) unto God, or, for God, i.e. according to the will of God, with a view to God as the end of all my actions. So Josephus ('De Maccabeis,' sect. 4) says that Antiochus Epiphanes made a law that all Jews should be put to death οἵτινες φάνριεν τῷ πατοίω νόμω πολιτευόμενοι \"who were seen to live according to the Law of their fathers.\" And so in 2 Macc. 6:1 it is said that he sent to compel the Jews to forsake the Law of their fathers - καὶ τοῖ τοῦ Θεοῦ νόμοις μὴ πολιτεύεσθαι ( ανδ not live agreeably to the laws of God. And once more, in 3Macc. 3:3, 4 the Jews are said to fear God and to be τῷ τούτου νόμῳ πολιτευόμενοι, living according to his Law. Here, then, πολιτεύεσθι τῷ Θεῷ means to live in obedience to God. St. Paul boldly asserts his undeviating compliance with the Law of God, as a good and consistent Jew (Philippians 3:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Ananias, the son of Nebedaeus, successor of Joseph the son of Camel, or Camydus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 1:3; 5:2), appears to have been actually high priest at this time. He was a violent, haughty, gluttonous, and rapacious man, and vet looked up to by the Jews (\"tres considere,\" Renan). He had probably lately returned from Rome, having been confirmed, as it seems, in his office by Claudius, to whom Quadratus, the predecessor of Felix, has sent him as a prisoner, to answer certain charges of sedition against him. He seems to have been high priest for the unusually long period of over ten years - from A.D. to A.D. (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 5:2; 6:2, 3; 8:8). But, on the other hand, Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:5) speaks of a certain Jonathan being high priest during the government of Felix, and being murdered by the Sicarii at his instigation; which looks as if Ananias's high priesthood had been interrupt el. It would appear, too, from 20. 8:8, that Ismael the son of Fabi succeeded to Jonathan, net to Ananias, as is usually supposed. But the question is involved in great obscurity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - And for for, A.V.; according to for after, A.V. God shall smite thee (τύπτειν σε μέλλει). A distinct announcement of something that would happen. (For the incident itself, comp. 1 Kings 22:24, 25; Jeremiah 28:15, 17; and Acts 12:1, 2, 23) Ananias perished by the daggers of the Sicarii (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 2. 17:9), at the beginning of the Jewish war under the procuratorship of Florus, in the year A.D. . He had been previously deposed from the high priesthood by King Agrippa toward the close of the government of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8), about A.D. , or early in A.D. , less than two years from the present time. Thou whited wall. This expression is admirably illustrated by the quotations from Seneca in Kuinoel: \"These base and sordid spirits are like the walls of their own houses, only beautiful on the outside.\" \"What are our gilt roofs hut lies? for we well know that under the gilding unseemly beams are concealed.\" \"It is not only our walls which are coated with a thin outward ornament; the greatness of those men whom you see strutting in their pride is mere tinsel; look beneath the surface, and you will see all the evil that is hid under that thin crust of dignity\" ('De Provid.,' 6, and 'Epist.' 115). Ananias was sitting in his priestly robes of office, presiding over the council in power and dignity, and presumably a righteous judge, but his heart within was polluted with injustice, selfishness, and a corrupt disposition, which made him act unrighteously (comp. Matthew 23:27). Contrary to the Law; or, acting illegally; παρανομῶν, only found here in the New Testament, but common in classical Greek. St. Paul's temper was very excusably roused by the brutality and injustice of Ananias. But we may, perhaps, think that he did not quite attain to \"the mind that was in Christ Jesus,\" who \"when he was reviled, reviled not again,\" but was \"led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, he opened not his mouth\" (Acts 8:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - God's high priest. This seems to show that Ananias actually was high priest, though some think that he had thrust himself into the office after his return from Rome, without due authority, and that this was the reason why St. Paul excused himself by saying, in ver. 5, \"I wist not that he was high priest.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And Paul said for then said Paul, A.V.; high for the high, A.V.; a ruler for the ruler, A.V. I wist not, etc. These words express, as distinctly as words can express anything, that St. Paul was not aware, when he called Ananias a \"whited wall,\" that he was addressing the high priest. Different reasons for this ignorance have been given. Some think that it arose from the uncertainty that existed whether Ananias really was high priest or not at this time, or whether the office was not in abeyance. Others attribute to Paul's weakness of sight the fact that he did not see that Ananias was sitting in the presidential chair, neither was able to recognize his features. Others, giving to οὐκ ἤδειν α sense which it never bus, render, \"I did not reflect,\" or \"bear in mind, that he was high priest.\" What is certain is that for some reason or other Paul did not know that he was speaking to the high priest. Had he known it, he would not have said what he did say, because the Law is express which says, Ἄρχοντα τοῦ λαοῦ σου οὐ κακῶς ἐρεῖς (Exodus 22:28, LXX.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Brethren for men and brethren, A.V. (as in ver. 1); a son of Pharisees for the son of a Pharisee, A.V. and T.R.; touching for of, A.V. When Paul perceived, etc. Possibly the Pharisees in the Sanhedrim were disgusted at the brutal act of Ananias, and were not sorry to hear him called \"a whited wall;\" and St. Paul's quick intelligence saw at a glance that the whole council did not sympathize with their president, and divined the cause. With a ready wit, therefore, he proclaimed himself a Pharisee, and, seizing upon the great dogma of the resurrection, which Christians held in common with the Pharisees, he rallied to his side all who were Pharisees in the assembly. Of Pharisees. The R.T. has Φαρισαίων (in the plural), which gives the sense that his ancestors were Pharisees (comp. Philippians 3:5). Touching the hope, etc. (see Acts 24:21). The words are somewhat difficult to construe. Some take \"the hope and resin'. rection of the dead\" for a hendiadys, equivalent to \"the hope of the resurrection of the dead.\" Some take ἐλπίς by itself, as meaning \"the hope of a future life.\" Perhaps the exact form of the words is, \"Touching the hope and (its ultimate object) the resurrection of the dead I am called in question.\" The article is omitted after the preposition (Alford). As regards St. Paul's action in taking advantage of the strong party feeling by which the Sanhedrim was divided, there is a difference of opinion. Some, as Alford, think that the presence of mind and skill with which Paul divided the hostile assembly was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise (Mark 13:9-11; see Homiletics, 1-11) to suggest by his Spirit to those under persecution what they ought to say. Farrar, on the contrary, strongly blames St. Paul, and says,\" The plan showed great knowledge of character... but was it worthy of St. Paul?... Could he worthily say, 'I am a Pharisee'? Had he any right to inflame an existing animosity?\" and more to the same effect (vol. it. pp. 325-328). But it could not be wrong for St. Paul to take advantage of the agreement of Christian doctrine with some of the tenets of the Pharisees, to check the Pharisees from joining with the Sadducees in crushing that doctrine. He had never thrown off his profession as a Jew, and if a Jew, then one of the straitest sect of the Jews, in any of its main features; and if he claimed the freedom of a Roman citizen to save himself from scourging, why not the fact of being a Pharisee of Pharisees to save himself from an iniquitous sentence of the Sanhedrim?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Sadducees for the Sadducees, A.V.; assembly for multitude, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Neither angel, etc. Is there any connection between this expression and that in Acts 12:15, \"It is his angel\" (see ver. 9)?

A great dissension; στάσεως, as in Acts 15:2. and above, ver. 7. The state of things here described is exactly what the pages of Josephus and of Tacitus disclose as to the combustible state of the Jewish mind generally just before the commencement of the Jewish war. The Roman power was the one element of quiet and order. The tower of Antonia was the one place of safety in Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The R.T. omits Paul, in the T.R. and A.V.; concerning for of, A.V.; at for in, A.V. The Lord stood by him. The jaded, harassed, and overwrought spirit needed some unusual support. The Lord whom Paul loved, and for whom he was suffering so much, knew it, and in his tender care for his servant stood by him and spake a word of gracious encouragement to him. Paul felt that he was not forgotten or forsaken. There was more work for him to do, in spite of all the hatred of his countrymen. The capital of heathendom must hear his testimony as well the metropolis of the circumcision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The Jews for certain of the Jews, A.V. and T.R. Banded together (ποιήσαντες συστροφὴν). This word συστροφή is found in the New Testament only here and Acts 19:40, where it is rendered \"concourse.\" The sense of \"a conspiracy,\" which it has here, is common in the LXX. (see Amos 7:10; 2 Kings 15:15, etc.). The verb συστρέφειν in the LXX. has the sense of \"to conspire\" (2 Samuel 15:31; 2 Kings 10:9; 2 Kings 15:30, συνέστρεψε σύστρεμμα). Bound themselves under a curse (ἀνεθεμάτισαν ἑαυτοὺς). The word ἀνάθεμα (Romans 9:3; 1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 Corinthians 16:22; Galatians 1:8, 9) corresponds to the Hebrew צּצּצּ, the devotion of anything to destruction; and hence \"the thing itself so devoted.\" And the verb ἀναθεματίζεν corresponds to the Hebrew צּצּצּ, to devote to destruction, without the possibility of redemption. Here they made themselves an ἀνάθεμα if they did not kill Paul before partaking of any food. It seems, however, that there was a way of escape if they failed to keep the vow. Lightfoot, on this passage, quotes from the Talmud: \"He that hath made a vow not to eat anything, woe to him if he eat, and woe to him if he do not eat. If he eat he sinneth against his vow; if he do not eat he sinneth against his life. What must such a man do in this case? Let him go to the wise men, and they will loose his vow\" ('Hebrews and Talmud. Exercit. upon the Acts').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Made for had made, A.V. Conspiracy; συνωμοσία, in Latin conjuratio. It only occurs here in the New Testament, but is used occasionally by Diodorus Siculus and other Greek writers. The kindred word συνωμότης is found in the LXX. of Genesis 14:13, rendered \"confederate,\" A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The elders for elders, A.V.; to taste for that we will eat, A.V.; killed for slain, A.V. The chief priests, etc. Meaning, no doubt, those who were of the party of the Sadducees, to which the chief priests mainly belonged at this time. A great curse. There is nothing in the phraseology of this verse, as compared with that of ver. 12, to warrant the introduction of the word \"great.\" It is simply, \"We have anathematized ourselves with an anathema.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Do ye for ye, A.V.; the R.T. omits tomorrow, in the A.V.; judge of his case more exactly for inquire something more perfectly concerning him, A.V.; slay for kill, A.V. With the council. Either the temporary feeling of the Pharisees had subsided, and their old hatred come to the front again, or the high priest and Sadducees, by some plausible excuse, persuaded the Pharisees of the council to join with them in asking that Paul might be brought before them again. Signify. The word ἐμφανίζειν only occurs here and at ver. 22, in this sense of \"signifying\" or \"making known\" something, which it has in Esther 2:22, LXX.. Codex Alexandrinus (as the rendering of אָמַר, to tell), and in 2 Macc. 3:7, and in Josephus, as also in classical Greek. Elsewhere in the New Testament it means \"to manifest,\" or \"show,\" as in John 14:21, 22; in the passive voice \"to appear,\" as in Matthew 27:53; Hebrews 9:24; and in a technical legal sense \"to give information\" (Acts 24:1; Acts 25:2, 15). Judge of his case more exactly; διαγινώσκειν κ.τ.λ. The word only occurs here and in Acts 24:22. The classical use of the word in the sense of \"deciding,\" \"giving judgment,\" is in favor of the R.V.; διαγινώσκειν, like διάγνωσις, diagnosis (Acts 25:21), is a word of very frequent use in medical writers, as is the ἀκριβέστερον, which here is joined with it (Acts 24:22, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - But for and when, A.V.: and he came for he went, A.V. Lying in wait; ἐνέδρα, only here and in Acts 25:3 in the New Testament; but common in the Books of Joshua and Judges in the LXX., and also in classical Greek.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And for then, A.V.; called unto him one, etc., for called one, etc., unto him, A.V.; something for a certain thing, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Saith for said, A.V.; asked for prayed, A.V.; to for unto, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - And for then, A.V.; going aside asked him privately for went with him aside privately, and asked him, A.V. Took him by the hand (ἐπιλαβόμενος τῆς χειρὸς); see above, Acts 17:19, note. The action denotes a kindly feeling towards St. Paul, as indeed his whole conduct does (comp. Acts 24:23; Acts 27:3; also Daniel 1:9 and Psalm 106:46).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Ask thee to bring for desire thee that then wouldest bring, A.V; unto for into, A.V.; thou wouldest for they would, A.V. and T.R.; more exactly concerning him for of him more perfectly, A.V. Have agreed. Συντίθημι occurs four times in the New Testament, of which three are in St. Luke's writings (Luke 22:5; this passage; and Acts 24:9), and the fourth in John 9:22. As though thou wouldest. The R.T., which reads μέλλων for μέλλοντες, must surely be wrong. It is in contradiction to ver. 15, and makes no sense. The pretext of further inquiry was theirs, not Lysias's.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Do not thou therefore for but do not thou, A.V.; under a curse for with an oath, A.V.; neither to eat nor to drink for that they will neither eat nor drink, A.V.; slain for killed, A.V.; the for a (promise), A.V. Do not... yield (μὴ πεισθῇς); be not persuaded by them; do not assent unto them (see Luke 16:6; Acts 5:40; Acts 17:4, etc.). The promise, etc.; τὴν ἀπὸ σοῦ ἐπαγγελίαν. The word occurs above fifty times in the New Testament, and is always rendered \"promise\" in the A.V., except in 1 John 1:5, where it is rendered both in the A.V. and the R.V. \"message,\" which is the literal meaning of the word. In Polybius it means \"a summons.\" Either of these meanings suits this passage better than \"promise.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Let for then let, A.V.; go for depart, A.V.; charging for and charged, A.V.; tell for see then tell, A.V.; signified for showed, A.V. (see ver. 15, note). Charging (as in Acts 1:4; Acts 4:18; Acts 5:28, 40, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Of the centurions for centurions, A.V.; and said for saying, A.V.; as far as for to, A.V. Two hundred soldiers; one hundred for each centurion; στρατιώτας, foot-soldiers, who alone would be under the command of the centurions. The ἱππεῖς and the δεξιολάβοι would be under the command perhaps of a τουρμάρχης, or decurio, captain of a turma, or squadron. Here there would seem to be two turmae because a turma consisted of thirty-three men - here possibly of thirty-five. Spearmen; δεξιολάβοι. This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in any ancient Greek author. It is first found in\" Theophylactus Simocatta, in the seventh century, and then again in the tenth century in Constantine Porphyrogenitus\" (Meyer). It seems most probable that it was the name of some particular kind of light infantry. But it is not easy to explain the etymology. Perhaps they were a kind of skirmishers thrown out on a march to protect the flanks of an army; as Plutarch speaks of javelin-men and slingers being placed to guard, not only the rear, but also the flanks of the army on the march (Steph., 'Thesaur.,' under οὐραγία). \"Holding or taking the right\" might be the force of the compound, somewhat after the analogy of δεξιόσειρος δεξιοστάτης, etc.; which agrees with the explanations of Phavorinus παραφύλακας, and with that of Beza, \"Qui alicui dextrum latus [meaning simply latus] munit.\" Only, instead of the improbable notion of these men being a body-guard of the tribune - which their number makes impossible - it should be understood of the troops which protect the flank of an army on the march. Other improbable explanations are that δεξιολάβος means the soldier to whom the right hand of prisoners was fastened, or those who grasp with the right hand their weapon, the lance or javelin. The object of Lysias in sending so large a force was to guard against the possibility of a rescue in the feverish and excited state of the Jewish mind. And no doubt one reason for sending Paul away was his dread of a Jewish riot.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - He bade them provide for provide, A.V, (the infinitive παραστῆσαι); might for may, A.V.; thereon for on, A.V. Beasts (κτήνη); here \"riding-horses,\" as Luke 10:34. In Revelation 18:13 it is applied to \"cattle;\" in 1 Corinthians 15:39 it means \"beasts\" generally. In the LXX. it is used for all kinds of beasts - cattle, sheep, beasts of burden, etc. Beasts is in the plural, because one or more would be required for those who guarded Paul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he wrote a letter after this manner:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Form for manner, A.V. After this form. Luke does not profess to give the letter verbatim, but merely its general tenor, which Lysias might have communicated to Paul, or which Paul might have learnt at Caesarea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTClaudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Greeting for sendeth greeting, A.V. Governor; ἡγεμών, as ver. 24; propraetor of an imperial province, as distinguished from the ἀνθύπατος, or proconsul, who governed the provinces which were in the patronage of the senate. Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:7, 8) was a proconsul, and so was Gallio (Acts 18:10); Pontius Pilate (Matthew 27:2) and Felix were procurators, ἡγεμόνες, only in a looser sense, as the more exact name of their office was ἐπίτροπος procurator. Only, as they were appointed by the emperor, and often exercised the full functions of a legatus Caesaris, they were called ἡγεμόνες as well as proprietors. Felix, called by Tacitus, Antonius Felix ('Hist.,' 5:9), was the brother of Pallas, the freedman and favorite of Claudius. He as well as his brother Felix had originally been the slave of Antonia the mother of the Emperor Claudius; and hence the name Antonins Felix, or, as he was sometimes otherwise celled, Claudius Felix. Tacitus, after mentioning that Claudius appointed as governors of Judaea sometimes knights and sometimes freedmen, adds that among the last Autenius Felix ruled this province with boundless cruelty and in the most arbitrary manner, showing by his abuse of power his servile origin. He adds that he married Drusilla, the granddaughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, so that he was Mark Antony's grandson-in-law, while Claudius was Antony's grandson. But see Acts 24:24, note. In the 'Annals' (12. 5) Tacitus further speaks of the incompetence of Felix to govern, stirring up rebellions by the means he took to repress them, and of the utter lawlessness and confusion to which the province was reduced by the maladministration of Felix and his colleague, Ventidius Cumanus (\"cut pars provinciae habebatur\"). He adds that civil war would have broken out if Quadratus, the Governor of Syria, had not interposed, and secured the punishment of Cumanus, while Felix, his equal in guilt, was continued in his government. This was owing, no doubt, to the influence of Pallas. The same influence secured the continued government to Felix upon Nero's accession, Pallas being all-powerful with Agrippina. Such was \"the most excellent governor Felix.\" For further accounts of him, see Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 2. 12:8; 13.), who ignores his share in the government as the partner of Cumauus, and dates his appointment subsequently to the con-detonation of Cumanus at Rome, and is also there silent as to his misdeeds. (For further accounts of Felix, see 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 7:1, 2; 8:5-7, which relate his adulterous marriage with Drusilla, and some of his murders and cruelties.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Seized by for taken of, A.V.; was about to be slain for should have been killed, A.V.; when I came for then came I, A.V.; upon them with the soldiers for with an army, A.V.; learned for understood, A.V. The soldiers (τὸστράτευμα, as ver. 10). The army of the A.V. is out of place. Having learned, etc. Lysias departs here from strict truth, wishing, no doubt, to set off his zeal in defense of a Roman citizen, and also to anticipate any unfavorable report that Paul might give as to his threatened scourging.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Desiring to know for when 1 would have known, A.V.; down unto for forth into, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Found for perceived, A.V.; about for of, A.V. Questions; ζητήματα, only in the Acts, where it occurs five times (Acts 15:2; Acts 18:15; Acts 23:29; Acts 25:19; Acts 26:3). St. Luke also uses ζήτησις (Acts 25:20), as does St. Paul four times in the pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 1:4, T.R.; 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him.

A.V. and T.R.; I sent him to thee forthwith for I sent straight- way to thee, A.V.; charging for and gave commandment to, A.V.; to speak against him before thee for to say before thee what they had against him, A.V.; the R.T. omits fare- well, in the A.V. That there would be a plot, etc. Two constructions are mixed up either by the writer of the letter, or by the transcriber. One would be Μηνυθείσης δέ μοι ἐπιβουλῆς τῆς μελλούσης ἔσεσθαι, \"When I was informed of the plot which was about to be laid against him;\" the other, Μηνυθέντος μοι ἐπιβουλὴν μέλλειν ἔσεσθαι, \"When I was informed that a plot was going to be laid,\" etc. Against the man; πρὸς αὐτόν, as Acts 6:1; 1 Corinthians 6:1. But λέγειν πρός (instead of κατά), \"to speak against\" any one, is an unusual phrase. The T.R., which is retained by Mill, Alford, Wordsworth, Meyer, etc., is far more probable.

According to Howson, following the American traveller, the Rev. Eli Smith, the route lay from Jerusalem to Gophna, on the road to Nablous, and from Gophna, leaving the great north road by a Roman road of which many distinct traces remain, to Antipatris, avoiding Lydda or Diospolis altogether. Gophna is three hours from Jerusalem, and, as they started at 9 p.m., would be reached by midnight. Five or six hours more would bring them to Antipatris, most of the way being downhill from the hill country of Ephraim to the plain of Sharon. Attera halt of two or three hours, a march of six hours would bring them to Caesarea, which they may have reached in the afternoon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs23:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - But on for on, A.V.

See also Job 9:33, Διακούων ἀναμέσον ἀμφοτέρων, \"That might lay his hand upon us both,\" A.V., i.e. judge between us. Palace (ἐν τῷ πραιτωρίῳ). The praetorium - for it is a Latin word - was originally the proctor's tent in a Roman camp. Thence it came to signify the abode of the chief magistrate in a province, or a king's palace. Herod's palace seems to have been a palace originally built by King Herod, and now used, either as the residence of the procurator or, as the mode of speaking rather indicates, for some public office.

As soon as the charge is laid against, the prisoner, he is called into court, to hear what his accusers have to say against him, and as it follows at ver. 10, to make his defense (see Acts 25:16). We enjoy much peace. The groan flattery of this address of the hired orator, placed at the beginning of his speech, in order to win the favor of the judge, is brought into full light by comparing Tacitus's account of the misconduct of Felix in Samaria in the reign of Claudius, who he says, thought he might commit any crime with impunity, and by his proceedings nearly caused a civil war ('Annah,' 12:54); and his character of him as a ruler of boundless cruelty and profligacy, using the power of a king with the temper of a slave ('Hist' 5. 9.); and Josephus s statement that no sooner was Felix recalled from his government than the chief men among the Jews at Caesarea went up to Rome to accuse him before Nero, when he narrowly escaped punishment through the influence of his brother Pallas. By thy providence. \"Providentia Caesaris\" is a common legend on Roman coins (Alford). Evils are corrected. The reading of the R.T., διορθώματα, meaning \"reforms,\" occurs only here, but, like the kindred κατορθώματα of the T.R., is a medical term. Διόρθωσις, reformation, is found in Hebrews 9:10. The κατορθώματα of the T.R.

We have found (εὑρόντες). The construction of the sentence is an anacoluthon. The participle is not followed, as it should be, by a finite verb, ἐκρατήσαμεν (in ver. 6), but the construction is changed by the influence of the interposed sentence, \"who moreover assayed to profane the temple,\" and so, instead of ἐκρατήσαμεν αὐτόν, we have ὅν καὶ ἐκρατήσαμεν. A pestilent fellow (λοιμόν); literally, a pestilence; as we say, \"a pest,\" \"a plague,\" or \"a nuisance,\" like the Latin pestis. It only occurs here in the New Testament, but is of frequent use in the LXX., as e.g. 1 Samuel 2:12; 1 Samuel 10:27, and 1 Sam 25:25, υἱοὶ λοιμοὶ, \"sons of Belial;\" 1 Macc. 10:61 1 Macc. 15:3 ἄνδρες λοιμοί: and 15:21, simply λοιμοὶ (rendered \"pestilent fellows\" in the A.V.), and elsewhere as the rendering of other Hebrew words. It is occasionally used also in this sense by classical writers. A mover of insurrections (στάσεις, R.T.). This was the charge most likely to weigh with a Roman procurator in the then disturbed and turbulent state of the Jewish mind (camp. Luke 23:2; John 19:12). Felix himself had had large experience of Jewish insurrections. The Jewish riots at Philippi (Acts 16:20), at Thessalonica (Acts 17:6), at Corinth (Acts 18:12), at Ephesus (Acts 19:29), and at Jerusalem (Acts 21:30), would give color to the accusation.

Also, in the plural, the soldiers in the front rank. The sect of the Nazarenes. As our Lord was contemptuously called \"The Nazarene \"(Matthew 26:71), so the Jews designated his disciples\" Nazarenes.\" They would not admit that they were Christians, i.e. disciples of the Messiah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Moreover assayed for also hath gone about, A.V.; on whom also we laid hold for whom we took, A.V.

The remainder of ver. 6, after the words \"on whom we laid hold,\" the whole of ver. 7, and the first clause of ver. 8, are omitted in the R.T. on the authority of א, A, B, G, H, etc. But the propriety of the omission is doubtful (Alford, Bishop Jacobson, Plumptre), though sanctioned by Mill, Bengel, Griesbach, Lachmann, and Tisehendorf (Meyer). If the words are not genuine, it is a marvelously skilful interpolation, fitting into the place so exactly both at the beginning and at the end, and supplying a manifest want in the speech of Tertullus.

Of many years. If Paul was speaking in the year A.D. , and Felix had been governor only since A.D. , \"many years\" was rather an hyperbole. But Tacitus expressly states that Felix was joint procurator with Cumanus; and therefore he had been a judge to the Jewish nation long before the banishment of Cumanus. Tacitus's authority is infinitely superior to that of Josephus, and this passage strongly supports the statement of Tacitus ('Annal.,' 12:54). Make my defense (τὰ περὶ ἐμαυτοῦ ἀπολογοῦμαι). For the word ἀπολογοῦμαι, and for the situation of St. Paul, and for the gracious promise provided for such situation, see Luke 12:12; Luke 21:15; see too Acts 19:33; Acts 25:8; Acts 26. l, 2; and for the use of ἀπολογία, see Acts 22:1, note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Seeing that thou canst take knowledge for because that thou mayest understand, A.V. and T.R.; it is act more than for there are yet but, A.V.; I went up to worship at Jerusalem for I went up to Jerusalem for to worship, A.V.

The mention of the brief time of twelve days shows the narrow limits of time within which the crime must have been committed, while the adroit mention of the purpose of his visit, to worship, would show how unlikely it was that he should have gone with any evil intent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Neither in the temple did they find me for they neither found me in the temple, A.V.; or stirring up a crowd for neither raising up the people, A.V.; nor... nor for neither... nor, A.V. Stirring up a crowd. The reading of the R.T. is ἐπίστασιν ποιοῦντα ὄχλου, which must mean \"a stoppage of the crowd,\" in which sense it is a medical term. But Meyer thinks it is a mere clerical error for the reading of the T.R. ἐπισύστασιν, which is used in the LXX for \"a tumultuous assembly\" (Numbers 26:9; 3Esdr. 25:9), and in Josephus, 'Contr. Apion.,' 1:20, of a conspiracy or revolt. In the LXX. also the verb ἐπισυνίσταμαι means \"to rise in revolt against\" (Numbers 14:25; Numbers 16:19; Numbers 26:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Prove to thee for prove, A.V.

A sect, This, of course, refers to this expression of Tertullus in verse 5, Πρωτοστάτης τῆς τῶν Ναζωραίων αἱρέσεως, \"Ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.\" The word αἵρεσις, which means primarily \"choice,\" has not necessarily or even ordinarily a bad sense. In classical Greek its secondary sense was a \"sect\" or \"school\" of philosophy, Academics, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, etc. The Jews applied it to their own different schools of thought. So in Acts 5:17 we read, Αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, \"The sect of the Sadducees;\" in Acts 15:5, Αἵρεσις τῶν Φαρισαίων, \"The sect of the Pharisees;\" in Acts 26:5 St. Paul speaks of himself as having been a Pharisee, Κατὰ τὴν ἀκριβεστάτην αἵρεσιν τῆς ἡμετέρας θρησκείας, \"After the straitest sect of our religion\" (see too Acts 28:22). It begins to have a bad sense in St. Paul's Epistles (1 Corinthians 11:19; Galatians 5:20; and 2 Peter 2:1, αἱρέσεις ἀπωλείας, where, however, it gets its bad sense from the ἀπωλείας joined to it). In ecclesiastical writers it came to have its worst sense of \"heresy\" as something worse even than \"schism.\" In this reference to Tertullus's phrase, St. Paul seems hardly to admit that Christianity was properly called \"a sect\" by the Jews, but gives it the milder term of \"the Way\" (see Acts 9:2, note). The God of our [my] father (τῷ πατρῳ Θεῷ); comp. Galatians 1:14; and Acts 22:3; Acts 28:17. Observe how St. Paul throughout insists that, in becoming a Christian, he had not been disloyal to Moses, or the Law, or the prophets, or to the religion of his fathers, but quite the contrary. According to the Law. Κατὰ τὸν νόμον may mean either, as in the R.V., \"according to the Law,\" or, as Meyer takes it, \"throughout the Law,\" and then is better coupled, as in the A.V., with τοῖς γεγραμμένοις.

Since then he had spent \"some time\" (χρόνον τινά) at Antioch, had gone over all the country of Phrygia and Galatia, had come to Ephesus, and stopped between two and three years there, had gone through Macedonia, had spent three months at Corinth, had returned to Macedonia, and from thence had come to Jerusalem in about fifty days. All which must have occupied four or five years - from A.D. to A.D. - according to most chronologers. Evidently Paul had not been plotting seditious movements at Jerusalem, where he had only arrived twelve days before, for a purely benevolent and pious purpose, after an absence of four or five years Alms... and offerings.

The conversion of Cornelius with his household and friends, men belonging to the dominant Roman power; the work of Philip the evangelist, residing probably for some years at Caesarea, and working among Romans as well as Jews, must have given Felix some knowledge of \"the Way.\" He would learn something, too, both of Judaism and Christianity from Drusilla, his wife (ver. 24, note). When Lysias... shall come (see vers. 7, 8, and note). I will determine (διαγνώσομαι); see above, Acts 23:15, where the verb is in the active voice, and is rendered in the R.V. \"to judge.\" The idea of the word is \"to know with discrimination;\" and this is the sense it has in medical writers, who use it very frequently; as e.g. Galen says, Πρῶτον γὰρ διαγνῶναι χρὴ τί ποτέ ἐστὶ πάθος (quoted by Hobart).

Indulgence (ἄνεσις); literally, relaxation, viz. of the prison restraints and confinement. The word is used in the LXX. of 2 Chronicles 23:15, ἔδωκαν αὐτῃ ἄνεσιν, i.e. those who had taken Athaliah prisoner, \"let her loose\" till she got out of the temple court. It is also a common medical term for the cessation or remission of pain or disease. St. Paul uses it four times in his Epistles for \"rest\" or \"ease\" (2 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Corinthians 7:5; 2 Corinthians 8:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:7). Doubtless St. Luke was thus enabled to be much with St. Paul during his imprison merit, and, as suggested above, to have his help in writing his Gospel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - But for and, A.V.; Felix came for when Felix came, A.V.; Drusilla, his wife for his wife Drusilla, A.V.; and sent for he sent, A.V.; Christ Jesus for Christ, A.V. and T.R.

Drusilla. She was, according to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 7:1, 2) the daughter of Herod Agrippa I., who \"killed James with the sword\" (Acts 12:1, 2), and died shortly afterwards. She was first the wife of Azizus, King of Emesa; but Felix, becoming enamored of her on account of her singular beauty, employed a certain magician, a Jew named Simon, to entice her away from her husband, and persuade her to marry him, contrary, as Josephus says, to the institutions of her country. She perished, with Agrippa, her only son by Felix, in the eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of Titus (Josephus, as above). Tacitus says that Drusilla, the wife of Felix, was granddaughter of Antony and Cleopatra. But he seems to have confounded her with another of the three royal wives of Felix, mentioned by Suetonius in 'Claudius;' unless, perchance, as has been conjectured, be had two wives of the name of Drusilla, of whom one was, as Tacitus says, granddaughter of Antony, by being the daughter of King Juba and Cleopatra Selene, Antony's daughter (see note in Whiston's 'Josephus,' and in Kuinoel, on Acts 23:24). But there is no certainty on the subject. Only Josephus's detailed account of Drusilla, the wife of Felix, agrees with St. Luke's statement that she \"was a Jewess,\" and is beyond doubt true.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And temperance for temperance, A.V.; the judgment for judgment, A.V.; was terrified for trembled, A.V.; and when for when, A.V.; call thee unto me for call for thee, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Withal for also, A.V.; would be for should have been, A.V.; that he might loose him is omitted in the R.T. and R.V.; wherefore also for wherefore, A.V. Sent for him the oftener. The mixture of conviction with covetousness in the mind of Felix as the motive for seeing Paul is observable. As in other cases of double-mindedness, the convictions were doubtless stifled by the corrupt avarice, and so came to nothing.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs24:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - When two years were fulfilled for after two years, A.V.; Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus for Porcius Festus came into Felix room, A.V.; desiring to gain favor with the Jews for willing to show the Jews a pleasure, A.V.; in bonds for bound, A.V.; Felix is also transposed. Was succeeded by; ἔλαβε διάδοχον. This word occurs only here in the New Testament, but is used twice in Ecclesiasticus. It is also, as above noted, the identical word used by Josephus of Festus. But in Acts 25:1 Festus's government is called an ἐπαρχία, and Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:11) calls Festus an ἔπαρχος, instead of the more usual ἐπίτροπος. Could Josephus have seen the Acts of the Apostles? Porcius Fetus. Josephus speaks of him as sent by Nero to be the \"successor\" (διάδοχος) of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2. 14:1). Nothing is known of him from Tacitus or other Latin historians, and he appears from Josephus's account to have held the government for a very short time, probably less than two years, when he died ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 9:1). But the impression derived from Josephus is the same as that conveyed by St. Luke, that he was a just and upright ruler, in marked contrast with Felix his predecessor, and his successors Albinus and Gessius Florus. Desiring to gain favor χάριτι καταθέσθαι); literally, to lay up in store good will, or favor, or a boon, to be requited at some future period. A frequent phrase in the best classical authors. Felix had good reason thus to try and put the Jews under obligation to him at the close of his government. For the danger was great to the retiring governor of complaints being sent to the emperor of oppression and plunder, which were often listened to and punished. Josephus relates, in point of fact, that the chief Jews in Caesarea sent an embassy to Rome to lodge a charge against Felix before Nero; and that he only escaped punishment by the influence of his brother Pallas ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9). The scene in this chapter is a very striking one, depicted with admirable simplicity and force. The bloated slave sitting on the seat of judgment and power, representing all the worst vices of Roman degeneracy. The beads of the sinking Jewish commonwealth, blinded by bigotry and nearly mad with hatred, forgetting for the moment their abhorrence of their Roman masters, in their yet deeper detestation of the Apostle Paul. The hired advocate with his fulsome flattery, his rounded periods, and his false charges. And then the great apostle, the noble confessor, the finished Christian gentleman, the pure-minded, upright, and fearless man, pleading his own cause with consummate force and dignity, and overawing his heathen judge by the majesty of his character. It is a graphic description of s very noble scene.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Foetus therefore having come for now when Foetus was come, A.V.; went up for he ascended, A.V.; to Jerusalem from Casarea for from Caesarea to Jerusalem, A.V.

Chief priests; as in ver. 15 and Acts 22:30. But the reading of the T.R., \"the high priest,\" is more in accordance with Acts 24:1, and is approved by Alford. The high priest at this time was no longer Ananias, but Ismael the son of Phabi, who was appointed by King Agrippa towards the close of Felix's government (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8). He went to Rome to appeal to Nero about the wall which the Jews had built to screen the temple from being overlooked, and which Agrippa had ordered to be pulled down; and being detained at Rome as a hostage, he was succeeded in the high priesthood by Joseph Cabi the son of Simon. We may feel sure that on this occasion he was present before Festus, for he had not yet gone to Rome. Informed him (ἐνεφάνισαν); see Acts 24:1, note. The principal men of the Jews (οἱ πρῶτοι). In ver. 15 Festus speaks of them as οἱ πρεσβύτεροι. The question arises as to whether the two phrases are identical in their meaning. Meyer thinks that the πρῶτοι includes leading men who were not elders, i.e. not Sanhedrists. Josephus calls the leading Jews of Caesarea οἱ πρωτεύοντες τῶν Ἰουδαίων ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Asking for and desired, A.V.; to kill him on the way for in the way to kill him, A.V. Asking favor, etc. The Jews evidently thought to take advantage of the inexperience of Festus, and of his natural desire to please them at his first start, to accomplish their murderous intentions against Paul.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Howbeit for but. A.V.; was kept in charge for should be kept, A.V.; was about to depart thither shortly for would depart shortly thither, A.V. Was kept in charge. Festus did not merely mention the fact, which the Jews knew already, that Paul was a prisoner at Caesarea, but his determination to keep him there till he could go down and try him. The A.V. gives the meaning. Either δεῖν is to be understood, as if Foetus should say, \"Paul is a Roman citizen; Caesarea is the proper place for him to be tried at before the procurator, and therefore he must be kept in custody there,\" or some such words as, \"I have given orders\" must be understood before \"that Paul should be kept.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Saith for said, A.V.; which are of power among you for which among you are able, A.V.; if there is anything amiss in the man, let them accuse him for accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him, A.V. Which are of power among you; i.e. your chief men, or, as we should say, your best men, which would include ability to conduct the accusation as well as mere station. Josephus frequently uses δυνατοί in the sense of \"men of rank and power and influence,\" Ἰουδαίων οἱ δυνατώτατοι ('Ant. Jud.,' 14. 13:1); ἤκον Ἰουδαίων οἱ δυνατοί ('Bell. Jud.,' 1. 12:4), etc. (see 1 Corinthians 1:26; Revelation 6:15; and the passages from Thucydides, Xenophon, and Philo, quoted by Kuinoel). The rendering of the A.V., though defensible, is less natural and less in accordance with the genius of the language. Amiss; ἄτοπον, but many manuscripts omit ἄτοπον, leaving the sense, however, the same.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Not more than eight or ten days for more than ten days, A.V. and T.R.; on the morrow for the next day, A.V.; he sat... and commanded for sitting... commanded, A.V. On the morrow (see ver. 17). To he brought (ἀχθῆναι). The technical word for bringing a prisoner before the judge (Acts 6:12; Acts 18:12; Luke 21:12; Luke 23:1, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Had come down for came down, A.V.; about him for about, A.V.; bringing against him for and laid... against Paul, A.V.; charges for complaints, A.V. Charges; αἰτιάματα, only here in the New Testament, and rare in classical Greek. The A.V. \"complaints\" means in older English exactly the same as \"charges\" or \"accusations\" (comp. \"plaintiff\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhile he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Paul said in his defense for he answered for himself, A.V. and T.R.; nor for neither, A.V.; against for yet against, A.V.; sinned for offended anything, A.V. Said in his defense (ἀπολογουμένου'); Acts 24:10, note. The Law... the temple,... Caesar. The accusations against him fell under these three heads (Acts 24:5): he was the ringleader of an unlawful sect; he had profaned the temple; and he had stirred up insurrection against the government among the Jews. The accusations were false under every head.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Desiring to gain favor with the Jews for willing to do the Jews a pleasure, A.V. To gain favor, etc. (see above, Acts 24:27, note). It was not unnatural that Festus, ignorant as he still was of Jewish malice and bigotry and violence, in the case of Paul, and anxious to conciliate a people so difficult to govern as the Jews had showed themselves to be, should make the proposal. In doing so he still insisted that the trial should be before him. Before me; ἐπ ἐμοῦ, as Acts 23:30 and Acts 26:2; ἐπὶ σοῦ \"before thee,\" viz. King Agrippa in the last case, and Felix in the former. The expression is somewhat ambiguous, and may merely mean that Festus would be present in the court to ensure fair play, while the Sanhedrim judged Paul according to their Law, and so Paul seems, by his answer, to have understood it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - But Paul said for then said Paul, A.V.; I am standing for I stand, A.V.; before for at, A.V.; thou also for thou, A.V. I am standing before Caesar's judgment-seat (ἑστώς εἰμι). The judgment-seat of the procurator, who ministered judgment in Caesar's name and by his authority, was rightly called \"Caesar's judgment-seat.\" As a Roman citizen, Paul had a right to be tried there, and not before the Sanhedrim. The pretence that he had offended against the Jewish Law, and therefore ought to be tried by the Jewish court, was a false one, as Festus well knew; for he had the record of the preceding trial before him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - If then I am a wrong, doer for for if I be an offender, A.V. and T.R.; and for or, A.V.; if none of those things is true for if there be none of these things, A.V.; can give me up for may deliver me, A.V. I refuse not; οὐ παραιτοῦμαι. Here only in the Acts, and three times in Luke 14. Elsewhere, four times in the pastoral Epistles, and twice in Hebrews. Frequent in classical Greek. No man can give me up (χαρίσασθαι); as ver. 16, \"to hand over as a matter of complaisance.\" St. Paul saw at once the danger he was in from Festus's inclination to curry favor with the Jews. With his usual fearlessness, therefore, and perhaps with the same quickness of temper which made him call Ananias \"a whited wall,\" he said, \"No man (not even the mighty Roman governor) may make me over to them at their request, to please them,\" and with the ready wit which characterized him, and with a knowledge of the rights which the Lex Julia, in addition to other laws, conferred on him as a Roman citizen, he immediately added, I appeal unto Caesar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Thou hast for hast thou? A.V. and, as far as punctuation is concerned, T.R. The council. Not the members of the Sanhedrim who were present, but his own consiliarii, or assessores, as they were called, in Greek πάρεδροι, with whom the Roman governor advised before giving judgment. Unto Caesar shalt thou go. In like manner, Pliny (quoted by Kuinoel) says of certain Christians who had appealed to Caesar, that, \"because they were Roman citizens, he had thought it right to send them to Rome for trial\" ('Epist.,' 10:97). Festus, though, maybe, rather startled by Paul's appeal, was perhaps not sorry to be thus rid of a difficult case, and at the same time to leave the Jews under the impression that he himself was willing to send the prisoner for trial to Jerusalem, had it been possible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Now when certain days were passed for and after certain days, A.V.; Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at for King Agrippa and Bernice came unto, A.V.; and saluted for to salute, A.V. and T.R. Agrippa the king. Herod Agrippa II., son of Herod Agrippa I. (Acts 12.), and consequently brother of Drusilla (Acts 24:24). He was only seventeen at his father's death, and so not considered by Claudius a safe person to entrust his father's large dominions to. But he gave him Chalets, and afterwards, in exchange for it, other dominions. It was he who made Ismael the son of Phabi high priest, and who built the palace at Jerusalem which overlooked the temple, and gave great offence to the Jews. He was the last of the Herods, and reigned above fifty years. Bernice was his sister, but was thought to be living in an incestuous intercourse with him. She had been the wife of her uncle Herod, Prince of Chalets; and on his death lived with her brother. She then for a while became the wife of Polemo, King of Cicilia, but soon returned to Herod Agrippa. She afterwards became the mistress of Vespasian and of Titus in succession (Alford). And saluted; ἀσπασόμενοι, which reading Meyer and Alford both retain. The reading of the R.T. is ἀσπασάμενοι. It is quite in accordance with the position of a dependent king, that he should come and pay his respects to the new Roman governor at Caesarea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - As they tarried for when they had been, A.V.: laid for declared, A.V.; case for cause, A.V.; before for unto, A.V.; a prisoner for in bonds, A.V. Many days (πλείους ἡμέρας). Not necessarily many, but as Acts 24:17 (margin), \"some,\" or \"several.\" The number indicated by the comparative degree, πλείων, depends upon what it is compared with. Here it means more days than was necessary for fulfilling the purpose of their visit, which was to salute Festus. They stayed on some days longer. Laid Paul's case before the king; ἀνέθετο τὰ κατὰ τὸν Παῦλον. The word only occurs in the New Testament here and in Galatians 2:2, \"I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles.\" In 2 Macc. 3:9, Ἀνέθετο περὶ τοῦ γεγονότος ἐμφανισμοῦ, \"Heliodorus laid before the high priest Onias the information that had been given about the treasure in the temple\" (see other passages quoted by Kuinoel). The word might be rendered simply \"told,\" the thing told being in the accusative, and the person to whom it is told in the dative. It was very natural that Festus should take the opportunity of consulting Agrippa, a Jew, and expert in all questions of Jewish Law, about Paul's cause.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAbout whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Asking for sentence for desiring to have judgment, A.V. and T.R.

Informed me (see above, ver. 2, and Acts 24:1, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - That it is for it is, A.V.; custom for manner, A.V.; to give up for to deliver... to die, A.V. and T.R.; the accused for he which is accused, A.V.; have had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter for have license to answer for himself concerning the crime, A.V. To give up (above, ver. 11, note). Have had opportunity to make his defense (τόπον ἀπολογίας λάβοι); see Acts 22:1, note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - When therefore for therefore, when, A.V.; together here for hither, A.V.; I made no delay for without any delay, A.V.; but on the next day for on the morrow, A.V.; sat down for I sat, A.V.; brought for brought forth, A.V.

They brought no charge. The expression, common in classical writers, ἐπιφέρειν αἰτίαν, answers to the Latin legal phrase, crimen inferre (Cicero, 'Contr. Verrem.,' 5:41; 'Ad Herenn.,' 4:35). Such evil things as I supposed; viz. seditions, insurrections, murders, and such like, which were so rife at this time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Religion for superstition, A.V.; who for which, A.V. Certain questions ζήτηματα); Acts 15:2; Acts 18:15; Acts 23:29, etc. Religion (δεισιδαιμονία); see Acts 17:22, δεισιδαιμονεστέρους, where there is the same doubt as here whether to take it in a good sense or a bad one. Here, as Festus, a man of the world, was speaking to a king who was a Jew, he is not likely to have intended to use an offensive phrase. So it is best to render it \"religion,\" as the R.V. does. But Bishop Wordsworth renders τῆς ἰδίας δεισιδαιμονίας his own superstition, Paul's, which agrees with the context. These details must have been among those \"complaints\" spoken of in ver. 7. Whom Paul affirmed to be alive. Notice the stress constantly laid by the apostle upon the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. If his own superstition is the right rendering, we have here the nature of it, in Festus's view, belief in the resurrection of Jesus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked for because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him,, A.V. and T.R. I, being perplexed, etc. The ζήτησις spoken of by Festus does not mean his own judicial inquiry, though it is so used once in Polybius (6. 16:2), but the disputes or discussions on such subjects as the Resurrection, etc. (John 3:25; 1 Timothy 1:4; 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9), in which Festus felt himself at a loss. The A.V., therefore, expresses the sense more nearly than the R.V. The T.R. too, which inserts εἰς before τὴν περὶ τούτων ζήτησιν, is preferable to the R.T., because ἀποροῦμαι does not govern an accusative case, but is almost always followed by a preposition. Those who follow the reading of the T.R., περὶ τούτου, either understand πράγματος or refer τούτου to Paul or to Jesus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - To be kept for the decision of the emperor for to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, A.V.; should for might, A.V. The decision; διαγνῶσις, here only in the New Testament; but it is used in this sense in Wisd. 3:18 (\"the day of trial,\" or \"hearing,\" A.V.), and by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 15. 3:8). For the verb διαγινώσκω, see Acts 23:15; Acts 24:22, notes. The emperor (τοῦ Σεβαστοῦ); rather, as the A.V., Augustus. Augustus was the title conferred by the senate upon Octavius Caesar, B.C. 27, whom we commonly designate Augustus Caesar. It became afterwards the distinctive title of the reigning emperor, and, after the end of the second century, sometimes of two or even three co-emperors, and was now berne by Nero. Its Greek equivalent was Σεβαστός. Augustus may be derived, as Ovid says, from augeo, as faustus from farce, and be kindred with augur, and mean one blest and aggrandized of God, and so, full of majesty. It is spoken of all holy things, temples and the like, \"Et queocunque sua Jupiter auget ope\" (Ovid, 'Fast.,' 1:609); and, as Ovid says in the same passage, is a title proper to the gods. For, comparing it with the names of the greatest Roman families, Maximus, Magnus, Torquatus, Corvus, etc., their names, he says, bespeak human honors, but of Augustus, he says, \"Hie socium summo cum Jove nomen habet.\" And so the Greek Σεβαστός bespeaks a veneration closely akin to adoration. Caesar, originally the name of a family of the Juliagens, became the name of Octavius Caesar Augustus, as the adopted son of Julius Caesar; then of Tiberius, as the adopted son of Augustus; and then of the successors of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, who had by descent or adoption some relationship to C. Julius Caesar the great dictator. After Nero, succeeding emperors usually prefixed the name of Caesar to their other names, and placed that of Augustus after them. AElius Verus, adopted by Hadrian, was the first person who bore the name of Caesar without being emperor. From this time it became usual for the heir to the throne to bear the name; and later, for many of the emperor's kindred to be so called. It was, in fact, a title of honor conferred by the emperor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - And for then, A.V.; I also could wish to hear for I would also hear, A.V.; saith for said, A.V. I also could wish (ἐβουλόμην); but the A.V. \"I would\" quite sufficiently expresses the imperfect tense (ich wollte) and the indirect wish intended. Meyer well compares ηὐχόμην (Romans 9:3) and ἤθελον (Galatians 4:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - So for and, A.V.; they were for was, A.V.; the principal for principal, A.V.; the command of Festus for Festus commandment, A.V.;brought in for brought forth, A.V. With great pomp; μετὰ πολλῆς φαντασίας, here only in the New Testament. In Polybius it means \"display,\" \"show,\" \"outward appearance,\" \"impression,\" \"effect,\" and the like. It is of frequent use among medical writers for the outward appearance of diseases. In Hebrews 12:21 τὸ φανταζόμενον is \"the appearance,\" and φάντασμα (Matthew 14:26; Mark 6:49) is \"an appearance,\" \"a phantom.\" The place of hearing. The word ἀκροατήριον (from ἀκροάομαι το hear, whence ἀκροάτης, Romans 2:13; James 1:22, 23, 25) occurs only here in the New Testament. It is literally an \"audience-hall,\" and means sometimes a \"lecture-room.\" Here it is apparently the hall where cases were heard and tried before the procurator or other magistrate. Chief captains (χιλίαρχοι). Military tribunes, as Acts 21:31, and very frequently in the Acts. Meyer notes that, as there were five cohorts garrisoned in Caesarea, there would be five chiliarchs, or tribunes. At the command of Festus. These minute touches suggest that St. Luke was most likely in the hall, and saw the \"great pomp,\" and heard Festus give the order lot Paul to be brought. Brought in (ἤχθη); see ver. 6, note.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Saith for said, A.V.; behold for see, A.V.; made suit to we for have dealt with me, A.V.; here for also here, A.V. That he ought not to live (Acts 22:22). This had evidently been repeated by the Jews before Festus himself (ver. 7), and is implied by Paul's words in ver. 11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - I found...

Nothing worthy of death (see Acts 23:29; and comp. Luke 23:4, 15). I determined. The A.V., \"when I found . .. I have determined,\" is hardly good grammar according to our present usage. It should be \"determined,\" unless \"when\" is equivalent to \"inasmuch as.\" If \"when\" expresses a point of past time from which the act of determining started, the perfect is improper in modern English. The same remark applies to the next verse, \"I have brought him forth... that I might.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - King for O king, A.V.; may for might, A.V. My lord (τῷ κυτίῳ). Suetonius tells us ('Life of Augustus,' 53) that Augustus abhorred the title of \"lord,\" and looked upon it as a curse and an insult when applied to himself. Tiberius also ('Life of Tiberius,' 27), being once called \"lord\" (dominus) by some one, indignantly repudiated the title. But it was frequently applied to Trajan by Pithy, and the later emperors seem to have accepted it. It was likely to grow up first in the East. Examination; ἀνακρίσεως, here only in the New Testament; but it is found in 3Macc. 7:4 in the same sense as here, viz. of a judicial examination (the complaint being that Jews were put to death ἄνευ πάσης ἀνακρίσεως καὶ ἐξετάσεως); specially the precious examination of the prisoner made for the information of the judge who was to try the case. At Athens the ἀνάκρισις was a preliminary examination held to decide whether an action at law should be allowed. The verb ἀνακρίνω, to examine, occurs six times in the Gospel of St. Luke and the Acts (Luke 23:14; Acts 4:9; Acts 12:19, etc.), and ten times in St. Paul's Epistles (see also Hist. of Susanna 48).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs25:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - In sending... not for to send... and not, A.V.; charges for crimes laid, A.V.

The opposite phrase, κατὰ λόγον, \"reasonably,\" in Acts 18:14, is also of very frequent use in medical writers. Ἄλογος ἀλόγως ἀλογία are also not uncommon in Polybius, and in classical Greek generally. The charges against him (τὰς κατ αὐτοῦ αἰτίας).

According to the R.T., which is that generally adopted (Meyer, Kuinoel, Wordsworth, Alford, etc.), the accusative γνώστην ὄντα σέ is put, by a not uncommon construction, for the genitive absolute, as in Ephesians 1:18. The marginal rendering, because thou art especially expert, seems preferable to that in the text. Customs and questions.

But we find the phrase, τῆς ἐννόμου βιώσεως, \"the manner of life according to the Law,\" in the Prologue to Ecclesiasticus and in Symmachus (Psalm 38:6), though not in classical Greek. The verb βιόω occurs in 1 Peter 4:2, and not infrequently in the LXX. From my youth up, which was from the beginning among my own nation, etc., having knowledge of me from the first (in ver. 5). No appeal could be stronger as to the notoriety of his whole life spent in the midst of his own people, observed and known of all. The T.R. implies that his youth was spent at Jerusalem, according to what he himself tells us in Acts 22:3. The R.T. does so less distinctly. (For St. Paul's account of his early Pharisaism, comp.

On the contrary, in the next verse (ver. 6) he declares, as he had done in Acts 23:6, that it was for the chief hope of the Pharisees that he was now accused. He tries to enlist all the good feeling that yet remained among the Jews on his side.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Here to be judged for and am judged, A.V. To be judged (ἕστηκα κρινόμενος); rather, I stand on my trial. The A.V. seems to give the sense well. The hope of the promise. The hope of the kingdom of Christ, which necessarily implies the resurrection of the dead. This hope, which rested upon God's promise to the fathers, Paul clung to; this hope his Sadducean persecutors denied. He, then, was the true Jew; he was faithful to Moses and the prophets; he claimed the sympathy and support of all true Israelites, and specially of King Agrippa.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come.

The idea of the twelve tribes of Israel is part of the essential conception of the Israel of God. So our Lord (Matthew 19:28; James 1:1; Revelation 7:4, etc.). St. Paul felt and spoke like a thorough Israelite. Earnestly; ἐν ἐκτενείᾳ, only here and in 2 Macc. 14:38 (where Razis is said to have risked his body and his life for the religion of the Jews, μετᾶ πάσης ἐκτενίας, \"with all vehemence,\" A.V.), and Jud. 4:9, where the phrase, ἐν ἐκτενίᾳ μεγάλῃ, \"with great vehemency,\" \"with great fervency,\" A.V., occurs twice, applied to prayer and to self-humiliation. The adjective ἐκτενής occurs in Acts 12:5; Luke 22:44; 1 Peter 4:8; and ἐκτενῶς in 1 Peter 1:22. Serving (λατρεῦον); i.e. serving with worship, prayers, sacrifices and the like.

Why is it judged, etc. The use of d is somewhat peculiar. It cannot stand for ὅτι, but it is nearly equivalent to \"whether,\" as in ver. 23. The question proposed to the mind is here whether God has raised the dead; and in ver. 23 whether Christ has suffered, whether he is the first to rise. In the latter case St. Paul gives the answer by his witness to the truth, affirming that it is so. In the former case he chides his hearers for giving the answer of unbelief, and saying that it is not so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I verily.

By so designating the Lord of glory, he avows himself a member of \"the sect of the Nazarenes\" (see Acts 2:22; Acts 3:6; Acts 4:10; Acts 10:33, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And this for which thing, A.V.; I both shut up for did I shut up, A.V.

Were put to death; ἀναιρουμένων, a word frequent in St. Luke's writings, and much used in medical works, as well as ἀναίρεσις (Acts 8:1). The phrase καταφέρειν ψῆφον is unusual; φέρειν ψῆφον is the more common phrase, both in Josephus and in classical writers. I gave my vote, etc. Not, as Meyer and others take it, \"I assented to it, at the moment of their being killed,\" equivalent to συνευδοκῶν of Acts 22:20; but rather,\" when the Christians were being punished with death, I was one of those who in the Sanhedrim voted for their death.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Punishing them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme for I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme, A.V.; foreign for strange, A.V. In all the synagogues. Those in Jerusalem, as the contrast of the foreign cities shows. (For the facts, see Acts 8:1, 3.) I strove, etc. The \"compelled\" of the A.V. is the natural rendering of ἠνάγκαζον (Matthew 14:22; Luke 14:23; Acts 28:19, etc.); but it does not necessarily follow that the compulsion was successful. It might be in some cases, and not in others. Pliny, in his letter to Trajan, says that those who were accused of being Christians cleared themselves by calling upon the gods, offering to the image of the emperor, and cursing Christ, none of which things, it is said, true Christians (\"qui sunt revera Christiani\") can be compelled to do ('Epist.,' 10, 95, quoted by Kuinoel).

But ἐπίτροπος is a \"steward\" (Matthew 20:8; Luke 8:3); and hence the Roman procurator was called in Greek, ἐπίτροπος, and so were governors generally, as those who acted with a delegated authority. The chief priests. In Acts 9:1 Saul is said to have applied to \"the chief priest\" for authority. The high priest, as president of the Sanhedrim, acted with the other chief priests (Acts 9:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - On for in, A.V.; that for which, A.V.

It enhanced the wonder of that light from heaven that it should be seen above the brightness of the sun at midday, in such a latitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Saying unto me in the Hebrew language for speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, A.V. and T.R.; goad for pricks, A.V. I heard a voice saying, etc. (see Acts 9:7, note). In the Hebrew language. This is an additional detail not mentioned in Acts 9:4 or Acts 22:8; but recalled here, as tending to confirm St. Paul's claim to be a thorough Jew, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, and, moreover, to represent Christianity as a thing not alien from, but rather in thorough harmony with, the true national life and spirit of Israel. It is hard for thee to kick, etc. This, also, according to the best manuscripts, is an additional detail not mentioned before. The proverb Πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζειν, to kick against the ox-goads, as the unbroken bullock does to his own hurt, instead of quietly submitting, as he must do at last, to go the way and the pace his master chooses he should go, is found in Pindar, AEschylus, Euripides, Plautus, Terence, etc. The passages are given in Bochart, 'Hierozoicon.,' part 1. lib. it. Acts 39; in Kninoel, and in Bishop Wordsworth. The passage in Eurip., 'Baach,' 1. 793, 794 (750, 751), brings out the force of the proverb, viz. fruitless resistance to a superior power, most distinctly: \"Better to sacrifice to him, than, being mortal, by vainly raging against God, to kick against the goads.\" Saul had better yield at once to the constraining grace of God, and no longer do despite to the Spirit of grace. It does not appear clearly that the proverb was used by the Hebrews. Dr. Donaldson ('Christian Orthodoxy,' p. 293) affirms that\" there is no Jewish use of this proverbial expression.\" And this is borne out by Lightfoot, who adduces the two passages, Deuteronomy 32:15 and 1 Samuel 2:9, as the only evidences of the existence of such a proverb, together with a rabbinical saying, \"R. Bibai sat and taught, and R. Isaac Ben Cahna kicked against him\" ('Exereit. on Acts,' 9:5). It is, therefore, a curious question how this classical phrase came to be used here. Bishop Wordsworth says, \"Even in heaven our Lord did not disdain to use a proverb familiar to the heathen world.\" But, perhaps, we may assume that such a proverb was substantially in use among the Jews, though no distinct evidence of it has been preserved; and that St. Paul, in rendering the Hebrew words of Jesus into Greek, made use of the language of Euripides, with which he was familiar, in a case bearing a strong analogy to his own, viz. the resistance of Pentheus to the claims of Bacchus. This is to a certain extent borne out by the use of the words θεομάχος and θεομαχεῖν (Acts 5:39; Acts 23:9); the latter of which is twice used in the 'Bacchae' of Euripides, though not common elsewhere. It is, however, found in 2 Macc. 7:19.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said, Who art thou, Lord?

For to this end have I appeared, etc. On comparing this statement with those in Acts 9:6 and Acts 22:10, 14, 15, it appears that in this condensed account given before King Agrippa, St. Paul blends into one message the words spoken to him when the Lord first appeared to him, and the instruction subsequently given to him through Ananias, and the words spoken to him in the trance (Acts 22:17-21). This may especially be inferred from Acts 9:6, and again from comparing Acts 22:15 with this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDelivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Unto whom for unto whom note, A.V.

To open their eyes (comp. Luke 4:18 and the LXX. of Isaiah 61:1; 2 Corinthians 4:4-6, etc.). That they may turn from darkness to light (comp. Colossians 1:12, 13; Ephesians 5:8; 1 Peter 2:9, etc.). Remission of sins (see Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19; Acts 10:43).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Wherefore for whereupon, A.V.

How could I act otherwise, being thus directed?\" Vision (ὀπτασία); Luke 1:22; Luke 24:23; 2 Corinthians 12:1. Found also repeatedly in the LXX. of Daniel and Wisdom (comp. the use of ὀπτάνω, Acts 1:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Declared for showed, A.V.; both to them of Damascus first for first unto them of Damascus, A.V. and T.R.; country for coasts, A.V.; also for then, A.V.; doing for and do, A.V.; worthy of for meet for, A.V. Them of Damascus first, etc. He enumerates his evangelical labors in the order in which they took place: at Damascus first, as related in Acts 9:19-22; then at Jerusalem, as in Acts 9:26-29; and then those on a larger and wider scale, among the Jews of Palestine and the heathen in all the countries which he visited. Throughout all the country of Judaea. This does not allude to any preaching in the land of Judaea at the time of his first visit to Jerusalem (Acts 9:25), because he says in Galatians 1:22, that at that time, viz. before he went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, he was still \"unknown by face unto the Churches of Judaea.\" But he had opportunities later of preaching in Judaea. For instance, the language of Acts 11:29 suggests that such an opportunity may have arisen when Paul and Barnabas carried up the alms of the Christians at Antioch \"unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea.\" Another opportunity he manifestly had when he passed with Barnabas through Phoenicia and Samaria to Jerusalem, as related in Acts 15:3. Another, when he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem, as related in Acts 18:22. Again, there was room for working among the Jews in Palestine while he was staying at Caesarea \"many days,\" and journeying to Jerusalem, as we read in Acts 21:10, 15. So that there is no contradiction whatever between the statement in this verse and that in Galatians 1:22. The clauses in this verse are two:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) \"both to them at Damascus, and at Jerusalem first;\" andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) \"and throughout all Judaea, and to the Gentiles.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This cause for these causes, A.V.; seized for caught, A.V.; essayed for went about, A.V. For this cause. Here again is a most telling statement. \"I have spent my life in trying to persuade men to repent and turn to God, and for doing so the Jews seek to kill me. Can this be right? Will not you, O King Agrippa, protect me from such an unjust requital?\" To kill me; διαχειρίσασθαι, here and in Acts 5:30 only in the New Testament; not in the LXX., but in Polybius, and in Hippocrates and Galen, of surgical operations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaving therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The help that is from God for help of God, A.V.; stand for continue, A.V.; testifying for witnessing, A.V.; nothing but what for none other things than those which, A.V. Help, etc.; ἐπικουρία, here only and in Wisd. 13:18, still of Divine help; in medical writers frequently, of aid from medicine and physicians; common also in classical writers, of auxiliary forces. It is properly spoken of help and allies from without (Bengel). I stand; i.e. I continue unmoved, steadfast, and, by God's help, not crushed by my enemies. Testifying. The natural rendering of the R.T. μαρτυρόμενος. The T.R. μαρτυρούμενος, followed by ὑπὸ, would mean \"borne witness to,\" \"approved,\" as in Acts 6:3; Acts 10:22, etc., and so Meyer understands it here. But μαρτυρύμενος makes much better sense, and is much better supported by manuscript authority. It is in close agreement with Acts 9:15 and Acts 22:15, that St Paul should thus \"testify\" to small and great.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - How that the Christ must for that Christ should, A.V.; how that he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim for that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show, A.V.; both to for unto, A.V. and T.R. How that (εἰ); see ver. 8, note. Must suffer; ταθητός only here and in profane Greek writers. The exact meaning of παθητός is \"liable to suffering,\" just as θνητός (from θνήσκω) means \"liable to death,\" i.e. mortal. But just as θνητός in use comes to mean \"one who must die,\" so παθητός means \"one who must suffer;\" and so we read in Luke 24:26, Οὐχὶ ἔδει παθεῖν τὸν Ξριστὸν καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὑτοῦ; \"Ought not Christ to have suffered,\" etc.? And so again in Luke 24:46 (T.R.), Ἔδει παθεῖν τὸν Ξριστὸν καὶ ἀναστῆναι ἐκ νεκρῶν, \"It behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead,\" where the turn of thought is exactly the same as here. The Vulgate renders it by passibilis. The Fathers (Ignatius, Polycarp, Justin Martyr) contrast the state of Christ in glory with his state in the flesh by the words ἀπαθής and παθητός, \"impassible\" and \"passible.\" That he first by the resurrection of the dead should proclaim, etc. Most commentators, from Chrysostom downwards, connect the first with the resurrection. \"First from the resurrection,\" equal to πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν (Colossians 1:18). As Meyer truly says, \"The chief stress of this sentence lies on πρῶτος ἐξ ἀναστάσεως.\" The A.V. gives the sense by a periphrasis; only it must be well understood that it was especially by being the first to rise, and so to bring life and immortality to light, that Christ showed light to the people. The words may, of course, be construed as the R.V. does, but such a rendering is not in accordance with the spirit of the passage or the analogy of other passages. Christ was the first rise, and he will be followed by them that are his. But it is not true to say that he was the first to give light to Jews and Gentiles, and will be followed by others doing the same. (For the sentiment, setup. Luke 2:32.) Note on the whole the enormous stress laid by St. Paul on the fulfillment of prophecy as a proof of the truth of the gospel, following therein our Lord himself (Luke 24:25, 27, 44, 45).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Made his defense for spake for himself, A.V. (ἀπολογουμένου, as ver. 2); saith for said, A.V.; mad for beside thyself, A.V.; thy much for much, A.V.; turn thee to madness for make thee mad, A.V. With a loud voice. Another detail, betraying the eyewitness of the scene described. Thou art mad (μαίνῃ); Acts 12:15; John 10:20; 1 Corinthians 14:23. Much learning (τὰ πολλά γράμματα). So John 7:15, \"How knoweth this man letters (γράμματα)?\" is equivalent to Whence hath this man this wisdom? (Matthew 13:54). And ἀγράμματος ιν Acts 4:13 is \"unlearned.\" The excited interruption by Festus shows that he was unable to accept the truths enunciated by the apostle. The ideas of fulfilled prophecy, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of a crucified Jew giving light to the great Roman world, were\" foolishness unto him,\" because he lacked spiritual discernment. He thought the apostle's glowing words must be the outcome of a disordered mind. Turn thee to madness (εἰς μανίαν περιτρέπει). The word μανία (mania) occurs only here in the New Testament. But it is the technical name in medical writers for the disease of μανία, mania, and is also common in classical writers. The verb for \"doth turn\" (περιτρέπει) is also peculiar to St. Luke, being found only in this place. It is used by Plato, but specially by medical writers, as is also the substantive formed from it, περιτροπή, spoken of the \"turn\" taken by a disease, and the simple verb τρέπει and τρέπεται: e.g. ἔτρεψε γνώμην ἐς μανίην: ἐς σκυθρωππὸν ἡ μανίη τρέπεται: τοῖς μαινομένοισι ἄλλοτε μὲν ἐς ὀῤγὴν ἄλλοτε δὲ ἐς θυμηδίαν (mirth) ἡγνώμη τρέπεται, etc. (Hobart, p. 468).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Paul saith for he said, A.V. and T.R.; excellent for noble, A.V.; words for the words, A.V. Most excellent (κράτιστε). It appears to be the proper title to give the procurator (see Acts 23:26; Acts 24:3). St. Luke also applies it to Theophilus (Luke 1:3). In classical Greek οἱ κράτιστοι are the aristocracy. Soberness (σωφροσύνη); sound or sober mindedness; just the opposite of the μανία of which he was accused. See the use of σωφρονεῖν (Mark 5:15; Luke 8:35; 2 Corinthians 5:13, etc.), and of σωφρονίζειν σωφρωνισμός σώφρων, etc. So also in Plato, σωφρωσύνη is opposed to μανία.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Unto for before, A.V.; is hidden for are hidden, A.V.; this hath not been for this thing was not, A.V. For the king, etc. Something in Agrippa's manner showed St. Paul that he was not unaffected by what he had heard. And so with his usual quickness and tact he appeals to him to confirm the \"words of truth and soberness\" which he had just addressed to the skeptical Festus. I speak freely. He was indeed a prisoner and in chains, as he so touchingly said (in ver. 29), but the word of God in his mouth was not bound. Παρρησιαζόμενος (see Acts 9:27; Acts 13:46; Acts 14:3; Acts 18:26; Acts 19:8; and the frequent use of παρρησία).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKing Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And for then, A.V.; with but little persuasion thou wouldest fain make me a Christian for almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian, A.V. With but little persuasion (ἐν ὀλίγῳ κ.τ.λ.). This saying of Agrippa's is obscure and variously explained. The A.V., following Chrysostom, Beza, Luther, etc., takes ἐν ὀλίγῳ to mean \"within a little\" or\" almost,\" like the Hebrew כִּמְעַט, which is very suitable to the context. The corresponding ἐν πόλλῳ, or, as otherwise read, ἐν μεγάλῳ would then mean, as in the A.V., \"altogether,\" and the sense of the whole passage is striking and appropriate. But there is some difficulty in getting Otis meaning out of the words. The natural way of expressing it would be παρ ὀλίγον, or ὀλίγου, or ὀλίγον δεῖ. Hence many other commentators take ἐν ὀλίγῳ to mean \"in a short time,\" and the sense to be either \"you are making short work of my conversion: you are persuading me to become a Christian as suddenly as you yourself did;\" with a corresponding sense for ἐν πόλλῳ, \"in a long time,\" i.e. whether it takes a short or a long time, I pray God you may become a Christian like myself;\" or, \"you are soon persuading me,\" you will soon persuade me if you go on any longer in this strain. Others, again, preferring the reading ἐν μεγάλῳ in ver. 29, take ἐν ὀλίγῳ to mean \"with little trouble,\" or \"with few words,\" as Ephesians 3:5 (understanding λόγῳ or πόνῳ), \"lightly\" (Alford), and then the opposite ἐν μεγάλῳ would mean \"with much trouble,\" \"with many words,\" i.e. \"with difficulty.\" But this is rather a fiat rendering. Another difference of opinion is whether the words of Agrippa are to be taken ironically, or sarcastically, or jestingly, or whether they are to be taken seriously, as the words of a man shaken in his convictions and seriously impressed by what he had heard. The whole turn of the narrative seems to favor the latter view. Another view, started by Chrysostom, is that Agrippa used the words in one sense, and St. Paul (mistakenly or advisedly) took them in another. Another possible explanation is that ἐν ὀλίγῳ is here used in the sense in which Thucydides employs the phrase (it. 86 and Ephesians 4:26), Τὴν ἐν ὀλίγῳ ναυμάχιαν and Ἐν ὀλίγῳ στρατοπεδευομένος, viz. \"in a narrow place;\" and that Agrippa meant to say, \"By your appeal to the prophets you press me hard; you have got me into a corner. I am in a στενοχωρία, a ' narrow room; ' I hardly know how to get out of it.\" The ἐν μεγάλῳ would then mean a\" large room,\" a εὐρυχωρία (Psalm 30:8). This would suppose ἐν ὀλίγῳ and ἐν μεγάλῳ to have become proverbial phrases.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs26:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Whether with little or with much for both almost, and altogether, A.V.; might become for were, A.V.

And in the place of hearing he had publicly stated that he had brought him before King Agrippa to be examined, that, \"after examination had,\" he might know what to write to the emperor. Accordingly Agrippa now gives it as his opinion that the prisoner might have been discharged if he had not appealed to Caesar. Festus was of the same opinion, and doubtless wrote to Nero to that effect. The result was that he was acquitted before the emperor's tribunal at Rome, at the end of two years.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.27":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - For, for into, A.V.; to a centurion named Julius of the Augustan band for unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus band, A.V.

The Augustan band; or, cohort (σπεῖρα); as Acts 10:1 (where see note). This σπεῖρα Σεβαστή, cohors Augusta, was probably one of the five cohorts stationed at Caesarea, consisting of auxiliary troops (though Alford does not think so). Its name \"Augustan\" was given, after the analogy of the Augustan legion, just as there was an \"Italian band\" as well as two or three \"Italian legions.\" It has been conjectured (Kuinoel, in loc.), indeed, that the name may rather be taken flora Sebaste, Samaria, as consisting of Samaritans, seeing that Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 2. 12:5) actually mentions a troop of cavalry (καλουμένην Σεβαστηνῶν) called the troop of Sebaste. But the Greek name is Σεβαστηνῶν, not Σεβαστή, which latter designation is not supported by any similar example (Meyer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Embarking in for entering into, A.V.; which was about to sail unto the places on the coasts of Asia, we put to sea for we launched, meaning to sail by the coast of Asia, A.V. and T.R.; Aristarchus for one Aristarchus, A.V. Adramyttium (now Adra-myti, where ships are still built), on the north-western coast of Asia Minor, south of Troas, on the gulf opposite which lies the island of Lesbos, was a place of considerable trade, situated on the great Roman road which connected the Hellespont with Ephesus and Miletus. Which was about to sail; μέλλοντι (not μέλλοντες, as in the T.R.), describing the ship as a coasting-vessel, trading between Adramyttium and other ports on the coast of Asia. She was now on her homeward voyage. Aristarchus. He is first mentioned in Acts 19:29, as a Macedonian, and one of Paul's companions at Ephesus, pro-badly, therefore, the fruit of his first visit to Thessalonica. We find him again with St, Paul on his last journey from Corinth to Asia (Acts 20:4), and we gather from the present notice of him that he kept with him till he arrived at Jerusalem, and followed him to Caesarea. It would appear at first sight, from Colossians 4:10, that he not only stayed with St. Paul during his two years' imprisonment at Rome, but was his \"fellow-prisoner,\" if at least the word συναιχμάλωτος μου ισ to be taken literally. This, however, is very doubtful, because in the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:7) St. Paul calls Andronicus and Junius his \"fellow-prisoners,\" though he was not then in prison himself; and also because, in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:23, 24), he gives this epithet to Epaphras, with the addition ἐν Ξριστῷ Ἰησοῦ (\"my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus\"), and does not give it to Aristarchus, who is named in the same sentence as his συνεργός (see Bishop Lightfoot, on Colossians 4:10, and Bishop Ellicott, on ibid.). If συναιχμάλωτος is to be taken of a bodily captivity, nothing is known of the occasion which gave rise to it in the case of any of the persons to whom it is applied.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the next day we touched at Sidon.

We touched; κατήχθημεν (as Luke 5:11; Acts 21:3; Acts 28:12) of coming from the sea to land, contrasted with ἀνήχθημεν in vers. 2 and 4 (ἀναχθέντες) of going out to sea (as Luke 8:22; Acts 13:13; Acts 16:11; Acts 18:21; Acts 21:1, 2; and frequently in this chapter). At Sidon; where doubtless there were disciples, as well as at Tyre (Acts 21:4), though there is no special mention of such. Paul was glad to have an opportunity of visiting them while the ship was stopping there to unload, and set down and take up passengers; and Julius, perhaps by the orders of Festus and Agrippa, and also from the influence Paul's character and conduct had on him (comp. Daniel 1:9), courteously gave him leave to land, probably accompanied by a soldier. And refresh himself; literally, to meet with care. Ἐπιμελεία occurs only here in the New Testament, but is found in 1 Macc. 16:14 2Macc. 11:23, and is frequent in Xenophon and other classical writers, by whom it is used with τυχεῖν, as here. Luke also uses the verb ἐπιμελέομαι (Luke 10:34, 35); and ἐπιμελῶς (Luke 15:8). It is in very common use among medical writers for the care and attention required by the sick. It is very probable that St. Paul was suffering from his long confinement at Caesarea, and that the ἐπιμελία here mentioned has reference to his invalid state.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Putting to sea (ἀνάχθεντες, see ver. 3, note) for when we had launched, A.V.; under the lee of for under, A.V. We sailed under the lee of; ὑπεπλεύσαμεν, only here and ver. 7. A nautical term, very rarely met with. The winds were contrary. The wind apparently was westerly, the prevalent wind at that season of the year. Smith ('Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul') quotes Admiral De Saumarez as writing from near Cyprus, \"The westerly winds invariably prevail at this season;\" and M. De Page, a French navigator, as saying, \"The winds from the west which prevail in these places (Cyprus) forced us to run to the north.\" This is exactly what the ship in which Paul sailed did. Instead of going in a westerly direction, and leaving Cyprus on her right, she turned due north, having Cyprus on her left. It was now late in August (Farrar, p. 363).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Across for over, A.V.; which is off for of, A.V. (τὸ κατὰ τὴν Κιλικίαν.). Across the sea. When they got under the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, they found the northerly wind, as M. De Pages did, and that enabled them to take a westerly course to Myra, a seaport in Lycia. The modern Turkish name of Myra is Dembre. (For an account and drawings of the wonderful rock-tombs of Myra, see Fellows's 'Lycia,' Acts 9.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - For, for into, A.V. He put us therein; ἐνεβίβασεν, only here in the New Testament, and once in the LXX. (Proverbs 4:11). It is a nautical term for embarking men on board ship (Thucydides, Xenophon, Lucian, etc.), and is also used by medical writers for \"placing patients in a bath.\" The corn-vessel (naris frumentaria) from Alexandria to Italy may very probably have been driven out of its direct course by the same contrary winds which forced St. Paul to sail under Cyprus (see Howson, vol. it. p. 325, note 5), or commercial objects may have brought it to Lycia, to carry Asiatic merchandize to Rome, in addition to its cargo of Egyptian wheat - possibly \"timber from the woody mountains of Lycia\" (Lewin, vol. it. p. 188, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Were come with difficulty for scarce were come, A.V.; further suffering for suffering, A.V.; under the lee of for under, A.V. Had sailed slowly (βραδυπλοοῦντες, only here). They were evidently sailing near the wind, and would have to tack frequently. They made in many days no more progress (some hundred and thirty miles) than they would have made in twenty-four hours with a favorable wind. With difficulty (μόλις) they could only just manage to do it, the wind not suffering them (μὴ προσεῶντος, here only). When they had with great difficulty got as far as over against Cnidus, on the coast of Carla, the north wind which caught them made it impossible to go further north. Accordingly they struck nearly due south, and bore down upon Crete, and passing Cape Salmone, its eastern extremity, they came along the southern side of the island.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - With difficulty coasting along it for hardly passing it, A.V.; we came for came, A.V.; a certain place called for a place which is called, A.V.; Fair for the Fair, A.V. With difficulty coasting along it; παραλεγόμενοι, only here and ver. 13. It is a nautical phrase, meaning to sail alongside of the coast. In Latin legere has the same meaning. The difficulty arose from their being under the lee of the island, which sheltered them from the north-west wind, but left them without any motive power. However, they managed to get as far as Fair Havens, where they anchored in the roadstead so called, near to an obscure and otherwise unknown town called Lasea, possibly the same as Lasos, mentioned by Pliny as one of the inland cities of Crete ('Nat. Hist.,' 4. 12:20), or as Elaea (ibid.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And for now, A.V.; the voyage for when sailing, A.V.; gone by for past, A.V. Much time (ἱκανοῦ χρόνου διαγενομένου). The word ἱκανός is very frequently used by St. Luke, both in the Gospel and the Acts, for \"much,\" \"many,\" or \"long,\" but the exact quantity of time, or words, or people, etc., indicated is of course relative to what might reasonably be expected in each case. Judas of Galilee (Acts 5:37) drew \"much\" people after him; the Jews at Damascus conspired to kill Saul after \"many\" days were fulfilled (Acts 9:23); Paul and Barnabas abode \"long time\" at Iconium (Acts 14:3); Paul talked a \"long\" while at Tress (Acts 20:3); and they sailed slowly off the coast of Asia \"many\" days (ver. 7); the length, i.e. the \"sufficiency\" (ἱκανότης) must depend in each case upon the standard by which it is measured. Here \"much time,\" measured by the common experience of sailing-vessels waiting for a favorable wind, may mean one or two weeks. It is more natural to apply the phrase to the time of their detention at Fair Havens, than, as Meyer and others do, to the time that elapsed since they sailed from Caesarea. The voyage was now dangerous (τοῦ πλοός, a late form for the older πλοῦ). Dangerous; ἐπισφαλοῦς, only here in the New Testament, and in Wisd. 9:14; also occasionally in classical authors, but very frequently in medical writers. The Fast. The great Jewish fast on the Day of Atonement, in the month Tisri, which fell this year on September 24 (Lewin and Farrar), probably while they were at Fair Havens. The Jews considered navigation unsafe between the Feast of Tabernacles (five days after the Day of Atonement) and the Feast of Pentecost (Lewin, vol. it. p. 192, note). It became, therefore, a very serious question what they were to do. Fair Havens was an inconvenient anchorage for the winter, and not near any large town. On the other hand, if they passed beyond the shelter of Cape Matala, which lay a few miles to the east, and where the coast of Crete suddenly trends due north, they would be exposed to the violence of the Eterian westerly wind. They called St. Paul into their counsels. Admonished them; παρήνει, only here and ver. 22. In classical Greek used especially of advice given by a speaker in a public speech. In medical writers it expresses the advice given by a physician to his patient.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The, for this, A.V.; injury for hurt, A.V.; loss for damage, A.V.; the ship for ship, A.V. Sirs, I perceive; etc. St. Paul's opinion and reasons are evidently not fully given; only the result, that he strongly advised against the course to which they were inclined, and foretold disaster as likely to ensue from it. I perceive (θεωρῷ), as John 4:19; John 12:19; Acts 17:22. In all these places something actually seen or heard leads to the inference or conclusion stated. So here the angry state of the weather and of the sea - perhaps they had walked as far as Cape Matala, and seen the rough waves - convinced him of the rashness of the enterprise contemplated. Injury (ὕβρεως, and at ver. 21); literally, violence, rough usage - properly of persons to persons (as 2 Corinthians 12:10), but metaphorically here transferred to inanimate objects. Compare the use of ὑβρίζω (Matthew 22:6; Luke 18:32; Acts 14:5; 1 Thessalonians 2:2), and the phrases ναυσίστονον ὕβριν (Pindar), θαλάττης ὕβριν (Anthol.), ὀμβρῶν ὕβρις (Josephus), quoted in Kninoel and Meyer. Meyer's explanation of ὕβρις, as meaning \"presumption\" or \"temerity\" on the part of the navigators, is quite inadmissible, especially in view of ver. 21. Also of our lives. Observe the thorough honesty of the historian who thus records the words of the apostle, though they were not justified by the event (vers. 22, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But for nevertheless, A.V.; gave more heed to for believed, A.V.; to the owner for the owner, A.V.; than to for more than, A.V. The master (κυβερνήτης), in the sense of \"a commander of a trading-ship\" (Johnson's 'Dictionary'); i.e. the navigator and helmsman, in Latin magister naris. The owner (ναύκληρος). The owner, no doubt, of the cargo as well as of the ship itself: ὁ δεσπότης (Hesych.); οἱ ναῦς κεκτημένοι (Ammonius). The κυβερνήτης and the ναύκληρος are often mentioned together; e.g. in Plutarch, Artemidorus, quoted by Alford, Kuinoel, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Put to sea from thence for depart thence also, A.V. and T.R.; could reach Phoenix for might attain to Phenice, A.V.; winter there for there to winter, A.V.; a haven for an haven, A.V.; looking north-east and south-east for and lieth toward the south-west and north-west, A.V. Not commodious; ἀνευθέτου (not well placed, or disposed), only here. But the simple εὔθετος is used twice by St. Luke (Luke 9:62; Luke 14:35), in the sense of \"fit\" (also Hebrews 6:7), and is of frequent use in medical writers, for \"convenient,\" \"well adapted to,\" and the like. To put to sea (αναχθῆναι); see ver. 3, note. Reach; καταντῆσαι, only in the Acts (frequently) and in St. Paul's Epistles. It is generally, if not always, used of coming from the higher to the lower place, and from the sea to the land (see Acts 16:1; Acts 18:19, 24; Acts 20:15; Acts 21:7; Acts 28:13, etc.). Phoenix. It is variously written Phoenicus, Phoenice, and Phoenix; and probably derived its name from the palm tree, (φοῖνιξ), which is indigenous in Crete. It is identified with almost certainty with the modern Lutro or Loutro, which is both \"an admirable harbor,\" situated exactly where Phoenice ought to be, and further by its proximity to a village called Aradhene, and another called Anopolis, shown to be the same as. Phoenix, or Phenice, which is described m ancient writers (Hierocles and Stephanus of Byzantium) as identical with or close to Aradhena and Anopolls (the upper city). Winter; παραχειμάσαι, so too Acts 28:11; 1 Corinthians 16:6; Titus 3:12, and παραχειμασία in this verse. It is found also in classical writers. Looking north-east and south-east. The margin of the R.V. has \"Greek, down the southwest wind, and down the north-west.\" This phrase has caused considerable perplexity to commentators. To say, as a recommendation of a harbor for winter quarters, that it lies or looks toward the south-west and north-west, and consequently is exposed to the most furious winter storms, is obviously impossible. If Phoenix was open to the south-west and the north-west, it would not be as commodius a place to winter in as Fair Havens was which was sheltered by Cape Matala. Two methods, therefore, have been adopted of explaining the phrase so as to make it give a reasonable sense. One, that adopted by Dean Howson and Bishop Wordsworth, viz. that it looks southwest and north-west, from the point of view of the sailor, or any one approaching it from the sea, the object upon which it looks being the land which locks it in and shelters it. The other is that supported by Alford, and adopted by the R.V., and rests upon the observation that λίβς and χῶρος are not points or' the compass, but the names of the south-west and north-west winds, and that to look down (κατά) a wind is the same as looking down a stream. If the harbour looks down the south-west wind it looks toward the north-east, and if it looks down the north-west wind it looks toward the southeast. Its open side would be from northeast to south-east, it would be entirely sheltered on the south-west and north-west side. This is the explanation adopted also by Dean Plumptre. The south-west wind; λίψ, only here in the New Testament, but frequent in classical Greek and in the LXX. (see Psalm 78. [82, Septuagint] 26). As a point of the compass, it is the rendering of נֶגֶב (Genesis 13:14, etc.), תֵימָן (Numbers 2:10, etc.), of דָרום (Deuteronomy 33:23). The north-west wind; χῶρος (the Latin Caurus or Corus), only here in the New Testament, and not found in Greek writers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They weighed anchor and for loosing thence, they, A.V.; along Crete, close in shore for close by Crete, A.V. Blew softly; ὑποπνεύσαντος, only here in the New Testament, and not found elsewhere. Supposing that they had obtained their purpose. A south wind would be quite favorable for sailing east or east by north, from Fair Havens to Phoenix. They not unreasonably, therefore, thought they could effect their purpose of wintering at Phoenix. And so they at once weighed anchor; ἄραντες, without an objective case following, \"having lifted up,\" understand τὰς ἀγκύρας, as in Julius Pollux, quoted by Smith. It was the nautical phrase. Sailed along (παρελέγοντο); see ver. 8, note. Close in shore (ᾶσσον, comparative of ἄγχι, nearer, meaning \"very near \"). For the earlier part of their voyage they would be obliged to keep very near the shore, to enable them to weather Cape Matala, which lay a little to the south of west from Fair Havens. Some take ᾶσσον as the name of a town on the coast, but the grammar of the sentence makes this impossible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - After no long time for not long after, A.V.; beat down from for arose against, A.V.; which is called Euraquilo for called Euroclydon, A.V. and T.B. There beat down from it (ἔβαλε κατ αὐτῆς). The meaning of this somewhat difficult phrase clearly is that given by Alford and Howson, and, on second thoughts, by Smith, viz. that a violent squall from the north-east beat down the heights and through the valleys of the island, becoming more violent when they had passed Cape Matala, and compelled them to alter their course, and run south-west before the wind towards the island of Clauda; ἔβαλεν in a neuter sense, \"struck,\" or \"beat,\" or \"fell,\" as in Homer (see Liddell and Scott). Κατ αὐτῆς. Farrar thinks it \"certain\" that the right rendering is \"against her,\" viz. the ship, because ἔβαλεν could not be used with nothing to follow it,\" 1.e. he thinks you must say ἔβαλεν κατὰ something. But as πλοῖον is the word used for the ship, not ναῦς, it seems very difficult to suppose that Luke could say αὐτῆς, and not αὐτοῦ. It is better, therefore, to refer ἀὐτῆς to Κρήτη, and either to understand it \"down it,\" like κατ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων, \"down the heights of Olympus;\" κατὰ πέτρης, \"down the rock,\" etc., or simply \"against it,\" as in the A.V., which obviates Dr. Farrar's objection. If taken in the sense of \"down\" there is the same idea of a squall \"rushing down\" from the hills into the lake, in Luke 8:23; and again in ver. 33 of the same chapter St. Luke tells us how the swine rushed κατὰ τοῦ κρημνοῦ, \"down the steep,\" into the lake. A tempestuous wind; ἄνεμος τυφωνικός, only here, and not found in Greek writers; but the substantive τυφώς τυφῶνος, is common for a \"furious storm\" or \"whirlwind.\" Euraquilo. Compounded - after the analogy of Euronotus, the south-east wind - of Eurus, the east wind, and Aquilo, the north wind, both Latin words (like Corns, in ver. 12), though Eurus is also Greek. This reading of the R.T. is supported by the Vulgate, and by \"Lachmann, Bornemann, Ewald, J. Smith, Hackett, Bentley, Olshausen, after Erasmus, Grotius, Mill, Bengel, and others\" (Meyer), and by Wordsworth, Alford, Lid-dell and Scott, Factor. On the other hand, Meyer, Tischendorf, Dean Howson, and others support the reading of the T.R. Αὐροκλύδων, and Lewis is doubtful. The derivation of Euroelydon would be from Αῦρος, and κλύδων, a wave. Whatever its name was, it must have been a north-easter. Psalm evil. 25 naturally arises to one's remembrance, with its fine description of a storm at sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Face the wind for bear up into the wind, A.V.; gave way to it, and were driven for let her drive, A.V. Was caught; συναρπασθέντος, only here in this sense of being caught and carried away by the gale, but used in three other places by St. Luke (and only by him), viz. Luke 8:29; Acts 6:12; Acts 19:29. It is found more than once in the LXX., and is common in classical Greek. Sophocles uses it of a storm which carries everything away, Πάντα ξυναρπάσας θύελλ ὅπως ('Elect.,' 1150). Face; ἀντοφθαλμεῖν, only here in the New Testament; but in Polybius and elsewhere it is said or' looking any one in the face with defiance. And so Wisd. 12:14; Ecclus. 19:5 (Complut. Edit.), ἀντοφθαλμῶν ἡδονᾶις, \"resisteth pleasures,\" A.V. Compare the phrase, \"looked one another in the face\" (2 Kings 14:8, 11, ὤφθησαν προσώποις). Hence here it means simply \"resist,\" or \"stand against,\" or, as well rendered in the R.V., \"face.\" Gave way to it, etc.; ἐπιδόντες ἐφερόμεθα, a rather obscure phrase, but best explained \"giving her\" (the ship) to the wind, \"we were carried\" rapidly before it. Ἑπιδίδωμι, is to give, to give up, to give into any one's hand (Luke 4:17; Acts 15:30). ἐπιδόντες is opposed to ἀντοφθαλμεῖν, giving up to, abandoning her to, as opposed to resisting. Ἐφερόμεθα, we were hurried along before the wind, without will or choice of our own (as ver. 17). Common in Homer and other classical writers, for being borne along by wind, or waves, or storm, etc. (For the application of φέρομαι in the middle voice to a wind, see Acts 2:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Under the lee of for under, A.V.; small for certain, A.V.

Cauda, or Caudos, as it is called by Pomp. Mela (2. 7)and Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 4. 12. 20), the modern Gozzo. Ptolemy (3:7) calls it Claudus. The manuscripts greatly vary. Clauda, or Cauda, was about twenty-three miles south-west of Crete. With difficulty (μόλις, as in vers. 7, 8). To secure the boat. The boat was doubtless being towed astern. But in the violence of the storm, there was a danger every moment of her being parted from the ship by the snapping of the hawser, or by being broken by the waves, and it was impossible to take her up. Under the lee of the little island, however, the sea was somewhat quieter; and so after greater efforts they secured the boat, and, as it is said in the next verse, \"hoisted it up\" on to the deck.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - And when they had hoisted it up for which when they had taken up, A.V.; be cast upon the Syrtis for fall into the quick-sands, A.V.; they lowered the gear for strake sail, A.V. Helps; βοηθείαις, in the New Testament only here and Hebrews 4:16; but frequent in medical language, for \"bandages, \"ligaments,\" \"muscles,\" and all kinds of supports both artificial and natural, and generally to medical aid. Undergirding the ship; ὑποζωννύντες, only here in the Bible; but found, as well as its derivative ὑπόζωμα, in classical Greek, in the same sense as it has here. In medical language it is used of certain membranes which \"under gird\" and so strengthen and hold together certain parts of the human body, and specially was applied to the πλευρά. As regards the nautical sense in which St. Luke here uses the word, Dean Howson, in his excellent chapter (23.) on the 'Navigation and Ships of the Ancients,' writes as follows: - \"In consequence of the extreme danger to which the ships of the ancients were exposed from leaking, it was customary to take to sea, as part of their ordinary gear, ὑποζώματα, undergirders, which were simply ropes for passing round the hull of the ship, and thus preventing the planks from starting;\" and he adds in a note that \"within the last twenty years (in 1837) marble tables had been dug up in the Piraeus, containing a list of Athenian ships and an inventory of their tackle, and that they all carried, as part of their \"hanging gear,\" ὑποζώματα. Another great ship described by Athenaeus carried twelve such. The operation of undergirding is still occasionally performed, and is called by seamen \"frap- ping.\" The German word is umgurten (Howson). Among ether recent examples (Howson, p. 33) the Albion was frapped with iron chains after the battle of Navarino. Cast upon the Syrtis. The wind was driving them straight toward the Syrtis Major, \"the Goodwin Sands of the Mediterranean\" (Farrar), and another twenty-four hours of such a gale might bring them there. The Syrtis Major was a wide gulf off the northern coast of Africa, now the Gulf of Sidra, lying between Tunis and Tripoli, considered very dangerous from its rocks and shoals. Be east upon (ἐκπέσωσι). The verb ἐκπίπτειν is the classical word (Homer, Herodotus, Euripides) for being driven or thrown ashore, and is used in this sense in vers. 26, 29 of this chapter, and in a slightly different sense in ver. 32. They lowered the gear (χαλάσαντες). Σκεῦος is a very common word, variously rendered \"goods,\" \"stuff,\" \"vessel,\" according to the material to which it is applied (Matthew 12:29; Luke 8:16; Luke 17:31, etc.). In the LXX. it is used of agricultural implements (1 Samuel 13:20, 21), of weapons of hunting (Genesis 27:3), of household furniture (Genesis 31:37), weapons of war (Deuteronomy 1:41), instruments of music (2 Chronicles 5:13). This is the only passage in the Bible where it is used in its technical sense as a nautical term. In classical Greek, when applied generally to ships, it means the whole tackling, sails, ropes, yards, stores, engines, etc. The meaning, of course, is narrowed when applied to some particular part of the ship. Here, on the whole, it seems to mean the \"great yard,\" or, if that had been already lowered, the heavy \"head-gear,\" ropes, pulleys, and the like, which, under the circumstances, would contribute to make the ship roll and be unsteady. The word rendered \"lowered\" is χάλασαι. It is rendered \"let down\" in Mark 2:4; Luke 5:4, 5; Acts 9:25; 2 Corinthians 11:33; and ver. 30 of this chapter (A.V.). In the R.V. it is sometimes rendered \"let down\" and sometimes \"lowered.\" In the LXX. it is used in the sense of \"spreading\" a sail (Isaiah 33:23), which would be equivalent to \"let down,\" if the sails were reefed at the top of the mast; and of \"letting down\" (Jeremiah 38:6). The R.V., therefore, is correct. The object of what they did was to enable the ship to go as near the wind as possible, and with as little straining and rolling as possible. The operation is called by sailors \"lying to.\" Were driven (see ver. 15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - As we labored exceedingly for being exceedingly tossed, A.V.; the storm for a tempest, A.V.; began to throw the freight overboard for lightened the ship, A.V. Labored; χειμαζουμένων, only here in the New Testament; but used by Plato, Thucydides, Diodorus Siculus, Josephus, and others, and especially by medical writers. It is the passive voice, and this is best expressed by the A.V. \"tossed.\" They began to throw, etc. The phrase ἐκβολὴν ἐποιοῦντο is one of the technical phrases for taking a cargo out of a ship, given by Julius Pollux; ἐκβολὴν ποιήσασθαι τῶν φορτίων (Alford, from Smith). It is also the phrase of the LXX. in Jonah 1:5, Ἐκβολὴν ἐποιήσαντο τῶν σκευῶν τῶν ἐν τῶ πλοίω. They began to expresses the imperfect. It is inferred from this, and the subsequent statement (ver. 19) as to throwing overboard the tackling of the ship, that, in spite of the undergirding, the ship was leaking, and therefore heavy with water, and in danger of going down (romp. Jonah 1:5). The freight here mentioned may have been heavy packages of merchandise other than the main cargo of wheat (see ver. 6, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - They for we, A.V. and T.R.; their for our, A.V. The third day after leaving Clanda. The leak doubtless con-tinned, and there was more water in the ship. With their (or, our) own hands; αὐτόχειρες, only here in the Bible, but frequent in classical Greek. The word seems to mark that the sacrifice was very great, implying a very pressing danger. The tackling (τὴν σκευήν). There is great difference of opinion as to what the σκευή means here. Smith thinks the main spar is meant, \"the huge mainyard,\" and Farrar adopts his view, which he thinks is strengthened by the use of the aorist ἐρρίψαμεν (for he adopts the T.R.), implying one single act, and showing, by the use of the first person, that it was the act of the whole crew united. Alford thinks that it means all the furniture, beds, and movables of all kinds, and so Wordsworth and Meyer. Wetstein explains it of the passengers' baggage. Howson thinks it unlikely they would have thrown away a great spar which would have supported twenty or thirty men in the water in the event of the ship foundering. Schleusner renders it \"apparatus quo navis erat instructa.\" Σκευή is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, and it is difficult to speak decisively. But the addition of τοῦ πλοίου, and the general use of σκευή in classical Greek favors the interpretation \"the ship's furniture\" (\"meubles et ustensiles,\" Renan).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Shone upon us for many days for in many days appeared, A.V.; now for then, A.V. Neither sun nor stars, etc. This is mentioned, not only as a feature of the severity and length of the easterly gale (for the wind had shifted two or three points to the east), but specially because in the navigation of that time, before the invention of the compass, the sun, moon, and stars were the only things they had to steer by, or by which they could know the direction in which they were drifting. Shone upon us (ἐπιφαινόντων); showed themselves; i.e. \"appeared,\" as in the A.V., which is the best rendering (romp. ἐπιφανεία, the appearance, or Epiphany). Now. Λοιπόν τὸ λοιπόν, and τοῦ λοιποῦ are used adverbially both in the New Testament and in classical Greek. It is sometimes rendered \"now,\" i.e. for the time that remains; and sometimes \"henceforth;\" sometimes \"finally\" (Mark 14:41; 2 Timothy 4:8; 2 Corinthians 13:11, etc.). It seems that sometimes χρόνον ισ to be understood, and sometimes that it means \"as for what remaineth\" to be said or done (romp. the French du reste or au reste).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And when they had been long without food for but after long abstinence, A.V. and T.R.; then Paul for Paul, A.V.; set sail for loosed, A.V.; and gotten for to have gained, A.V.; injury for harm, A.V. Long without food (πολλῆς ἀσιτίας ὑπαρχούσης). Ἀσιτία is only found here in the Bible; but it was the common medical term for loss of the appetite, and such is the most natural rendering here. There is nothing about \"long abstinence\" in the text, nor does the verb ὑπαρχούσης admit of being translated \"when they had been.\" It describes a present condition. The literal rendering is, when there was a great (or, general) loss of appetite among the crew. The terror, the discomfort, the sea-sickness, the constant pressure of danger and labor, the difficulty of cooking, the unpalatableness of the food, combined to take away relish of their food, and they were becoming weak for want of nourishment. Have gotten (κερδῆσαι). Schleusner, Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' explain this as equivalent to \"have avoided,\" or \"have escaped,\" and quote Josephus ('Ant. Jud,' it. 3:2), Τὸ μιανθῆναι τὰς χεῖρας κερδαίνειν, \"To avoid staining their hands;\" and ' Bell. Jud.,' it. 16:4 (towards the close of Agrippa's speech), Τῆς ἥττης ὄνειδος κερδήσετε,\" You will gain (i.e. avoid) the disgrace of defeat,\" like the use in Latin of lucrifacere. But it is simpler on the whole to understand it in the sense of \"getting\" as the fruit of your own conduct. We should say in English, \"What have yon gained by this? Nothing but loss and shame.\" Compare too the phrase Τὰ ὀψώνια τῆς ἀμαρτίας θάνατος (Romans 6:23). So Liddell and Scott give us one use of κερδαίνειν, to gain a loss, 1.e. reap disadvantage, and quote from Euripides, 'Hecuba,' 1. 518 (516, Scholefield), διπλᾶ δάκρυα κερδᾶναι, \"to gain double weeping.\" Injury (ὕβριν); see ver. 10, note. In the A.V. \"to have gained\" observe the same idiom as in ver. 10, \"and there to winter.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Life for any man's life, A.V.; but only for but, A.V, I exhort you to be of good cheer. Mr. Hobart remarks that this \"has all the look of a doctor's expression, παραινεῖν being the term for a physician giving his advice,\" and \"εὔθυμος εὐθυμεῖν, and εὔθυμως being used in medical language in reference to the sick keeping up their spirits, as opposed to ἀθυμία and δυσθυμυία (see ver. 25, note). Loss; ἀποβολή, only here and Romans 11:15; but found in Plato, Aristotle, Josephus, Plutarch, etc. Mark how the message of mercy and love follows the chastisement and its fruit of self-humiliation. In their prosperity and self-confidence they rejected Paul's word at Fair Havens; they listen to it at death's door.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - An angel of the God whose I am, whom also for the angel of God, whose I am, and whom, A.V. and T.R.

Stand; παραστῆναι, the proper word for standing before a judge; comp. Romans 14:10, Πάντες παραστησόμεθα τῷ βήματι τοῦ Ξριστοῦ: and in the subscription to the Second Epistle to Timothy it is said that it was written \"when Paul was brought before Nero the second time\" (Greek, ὅτε ἐκ δευτέρου παρέστη Παῦλος τῷ Καίσαρι). God hath granted, etc. Doubtless in answer to his prayers. Compare the opposite statement in Ezekiel 14:14, 16, 18, 20, \"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered themselves;\" and see also Genesis 18:26, 32. Paul's calm courage and kind words, added to the proof they had of his prescient wisdom, were well calculated to inspire the crew with a reverential trust in him, and to rekindle their extinguished hope.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Even so for even, A.V.; hath been spoken unto me for was told me, A.V. Be of good cheer; εὐθυμεῖτε, as ver. 22; elsewhere only James 5:13, but we have εὔθυμος ver. 36 and Acts 24:10; common in classical Greek and in medical language (see ver. 22, note). Note how the servant of God has the light of hope and trust in the darkest night of danger and suffering (Psalm 112:4, 7; Psalm 46:1-3). It shall be even so, etc. Compare for the lesson of faith in God's promise, Luke 1:45, \"There shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.\" \"Lord, increase our faith.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - We must be east, etc. (ἐκπεσεῖν, ver. 17, note). Here St. Paul speaks distinctly by revelation, probably what was told him by the angel. We can see the same purpose here as in all miracles and prophetic utterances, viz. to give God's credentials to his ambassador as speaking in his Name and by his authority (John 20:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - To and fro for up and down, A.V.; the sea of Adria for Adria, A.V.; sailors for shipmen, A.V.; surmised for deemed, A.V.; were drawing for drew, A.V. The fourteenth night, reckoned from their leaving Fair Havens (so vers. 18, 19). Driven to and fro (διαφερομένων); it is rather carried across, or along, from one end to the other. Sea of Adria. Adria, as in the A.V., is scarcely correct, as a translation of the Greek (though the Latins did call it Adria), because the nominative case in Greek is ὁ Ἀδρίας, sc. κόλπος, Adrias, the Adriatic Gulf. Ἀδρία is the name of the town near the mouth of the Po, which gave its name to the Adriatic. As regards the use of term ὁ Ἀδρίας, the Adriatic, it is used in two ways: sometimes strictly of the Gulf of Venice, the Adriatic; sometimes, chiefly in latter writers, in a much wider sense, of the whole sea between Greece and Italy, including Sicily. This last is its use here. So, too, Josephus says that he was wrecked κατὰ μέσον τὸν Ἀδρίαν, in the midst of the Adriatic, on his voyage from Caesarea to Puteoli, and was picked up by a ship from Cyrene. This implies that he used the word \"Adria\" in the same sense as St. Luke does (see further the appendix 5. and 6. in Smith's 'Voyage,' etc.; Conybeare and Howson, p. 343, note, and p. 350; Lewin, vol. 2. p. 198, note; Farrar, vol. 2. p. 377, note; Renan, ' St. Paul,' p. 552). Surmised that they were drawing near. Probably from hearing the waves breaking upon the Point of Koura, east of St. Paul's Bay. Υπονορω is only found in the Acts (Acts 13:25; Acts 25:18; and here); but it is used three or four times in the LXX. (Daniel, Job, Judith, Sirach), and is common in classical Greek in the sense of to \"suspect, conjecture,\" \"guess at\" anything (see ὑπονοία, 1 Timothy 6:4). Were drawing near, etc.; literally, that some country (or, land) was drawing near to them. In like manner, the land is said ἀναχωρεῖν, to recede, as the vessel gets out to sea.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - They sounded for sounded, A.V.; found for found it, A.V.

Luke 22:58, 59, μετὰ βραχύ κ.τ.λ., and then follows διαστάσης ὡσὲι ὥρας μιᾶς \"after an interval of about an hour\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And for then, A.V.; lest haply for lest, A.V.; be cast ashore on rocky ground for have fallen upon rocks, A.V.; let go for east, A.V.; from for out of, A.V. Cast ashore (see ver. 17, note). Rocky ground (τραχεῖς τόπους); Luke 3:5. The region of Trachonitis was so called from the rocky nature of the country - ἄκτη τραχεῖα, a rocky shore, Four anchors, \"Naves quaternis anchoris destinabat no fluctibus moveretur\" (Caesar, 'De Bell. Cir.,' 1:25). From the stern. Anchors are usually dropped from the bow, but under certain circumstances ships anchor from the stern. The British navy so anchored at the battles of the Nile, Algiers, and Copenhagen, and it is a earn-men practice of the Levantine caiques at the present day; and an ancient picture of a ship (at Herculaneum) distinctly represents \"hawse-holes aft to fit them for anchoring by the stern.\" They did so in the present case, to obviate the danger of the ship swinging round and getting into breakers, and also that she might be in the best position for running on to the beach as soon as daylight came.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Sailors for shipmen, A.V.; seeking for about, A.V.; and had lowered for when they had let down, A.V.; lay out for have east, A.V.; from for out of, A.V. Had lowered (χαλάσαντες, see ver. 17, note). The sailors thought the only chance of safety was to get into the boat and run ashore on the beach. They pretended, therefore, that they wished to let down more anchors from the bow; and let down the boat, as if with that intention, being prepared to jump in and make for the shore, leaving the ship to be wrecked, with all on board her. What a contrast to the conduct of our English crews, who are always the last to quit a sinking vessel!NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPaul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Paul said. It is remarkable what ascendency Paul had gained during this terrible fortnight. He now penetrated in a moment the design of the selfish sailors, and, with his wonted decision, told the centurion, who was in command of the whole party (ver. 11), and who, it is likely, had iris soldiers on deck to preserve order and discipline. Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved. The ὑμεῖς is emphatic, you yourselves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Cut away for cut off, A.V. Fall off (ἐκπεσεῖν, vers. 17, note, 26, and 29). The action of the soldiers in cutting the rope and letting the boat loose was very prompt, but rather rash, as the boat might have been useful in landing those on board. But it showed their implicit confidence in Paul's word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Some food for meat, A.V.; wait and continue for have tarried and continued, A.V. All; including the treacherous sailors whose plot he had just defeated. Having taken nothing; not meaning that they had literally been fourteen days without tasting food, which is impossible; but that they had no regular meals, only snatching a mouthful now and then in the midst of their incessant toil.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Beseech for pray, A.V.; food for meat, A.V.; safety for health, A.V.; a hair for an hair, A.V.; perish for fall, A.V. and T.R. Take; here in the R.T. μεταλαβεῖν instead of προσλαβεῖν of the T.R. Your safety; or, health; i.e. for the preservation of your lives in the impending struggle. Not a hair perish; or, according to the T.R., fall. It is uncertain whether ἀπολεῖται (R.T.) or πεσεῖται (T.R.) is the right reading. The Hebrew proverb, as contained in 1 Samuel 14:45; 2 Samuel 14:11; 1 Kings 1:52, is, \"fall to the earth' or \"ground:\" Αἰ πεσεῖται τριχός (or, ἀπὸ τῆς τριχός or τῶν τριχῶν) τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν (LXX.). In Luke 21:18, it is Θρὶξ ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν οὐ μὴ ἀπόληται (comp. Luke 12:7). Absolute and complete safety is meant. He still speaks as a prophet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Said this for thus spoken, A.V.; and had taken for he took, A.V.; he gave for and gave, A.V.; the presence of all for presence of them all, A.V.; be brake for when he had broken, A.V.; and began for he began, A.V. Had taken bread, etc. The concurrence of the words λαβὼν ἄρτον ηὐχαρίστησε, κλάσας, which all occur in the institution of the Holy Eucharist (Luke 22:19), is certainly, as Bishop Wordsworth says, remarkable. But there is the same similarity of phrase (except that εὐλόγησε is used for ηὐχαρίστησε in the first passage) in Matthew 14:19 and Matthew 15:36, and therefore the conclusion to be drawn is that St. Paul's action and words were the same as those of our Lord, as far as the breaking bread and giving thanks and eating, went, which were common to both occasions; but in the institution of the sacrament the words \"This is my body\" were additional, and represented an additional and sacramental truth. Observe, again, the devout confession of the living God in the presence of unbelieving men (vers. 23, 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Themselves also took food for they also took some meat, A.V.

The ship in which Josephus was wrecked on his way to Rome, under the procuratorship of Felix (κατὰ μέσον τὸν Ἀδρίαν), carried six hundred souls ('Life,' sect. 3). The ship of Alexandria described by Lucian is calculated to have been of above a thousand tons. The mention of the number brings before us a striking picture of so many persons at St. Paul's bidding, in the midst of so great a danger, taking a cheerful and leisurely meal together, in dependence upon a speedy deliverance promised to them in God s Name. It also adds another vivid touch to the picture of the eye-witness of what he relates. Dean Plumptre well suggests that St. Luke very likely counted the crew on the. occasion of their being all assembled together for the first time.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Throwing out for and cast out, A.V. They lightened the ship; ἐκούφισαν, only here in the New Testament; but it is the technical word for lightening a ship so as to keep her afloat. So in Polybius, 1:39, Ἐκρίψαντες ἐκ τῶν πλοίων πάντα τὰ βάρη μόλις ἐκούφισαν τὰς ναῦς: and Jonah 1:5, \"They cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them (τοῦ κουφισθῆναι ἀπ αὐτῶν (see ver. 18, note). Κουφίσαι τὴν ναῦν is one of the technical expressions for taking cargo out of a ship, given by Julius Pollux (Smith), The wheat (τὸν σῖτον). There is a difference of opinion as to what St. Luke here means by τὸν σῖτον. Meyer and others think it was merely \"the ship's provision,\" and that, considering the number of persons in the ship, and the little consumption during the last fortnight, the weight of what was left would be considerable. They add that the cargo had been already thrown overboard in ver. 18. Others, as Howson, following Smith and Penroso, Farrar, Lewin, and many older commentators, with more reason, understand \"the wheat\" to mean the ship's cargo from Alexandria to Rome; they think it had been impossible to get at it while the ship was drifting; and that, even had it been possible, it was the last thing they would have recourse to. But now, when it was impossible to save the ship, and the only chance of saving their lives was to run her on the beach, it was an absolute necessity to lighten the ship as much as possible. They therefore cast her freight of Alexandrian corn into the sea, and waited for daylight (see note to ver. 18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Perceived for discovered, A.V.; bay with a beach for creek with a shore, A.V.; and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship upon it for into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship, A.V. They knew not the land. It was seven miles from the harbor of Valetta, and a part of the island not likely to have been visited by the sailors, and presenting no marked features by which they would recognize it. A certain bay with a beach; αἰγιαλόν, a level pebbly or sandy beach (Matthew 13:2; Acts 21:5; and ver. 40), as opposed to ἄκτη, a high rugged coast (τρηχεῖα ὑψηλή, etc., Homer). They took counsel whether they could drive, etc. The rendering of the A.V. is surely infinitely better than the R.V. The meaning of βουλεύομαι, both in the New Testament and in classical Greek, is frequently and properly \"to determine,\" \"to resolve\" or \"purpose\" (see Acts 5:33; Acts 15:37, note; 2 Corinthians 1:17; and Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon '); and the order of the words here suits the rendering of the A.V. much better than that of the R.V., which would require καὶ ἐβουλεύοντο, instead of εἰς ο}ν κ.τ.λ. The Revisionists seem to have been misled by the resemblance of Luke 14:31. Drive; ἐξῶσαι, the technical word for driving a ship ashore (Thucyd., 2:10, etc.). It only occurs in the New Testament here, and in a different sense in Acts 7:45. It is not uncommon in the LXX. as the rendering of דָּחָה and דּוּהַ (see Deuteronomy 13:3; 2 Samuel 14:13; Jeremiah 49. [LXX., 26.] 36, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Casting off for when they had taken up, A.V.; they left them in the sea for they committed themselves unto the sea, A.V.; at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders for and loosed the rudder bands, A.V.; hoisting for hoised, A.V.; foresail for mainsail, A.V.; for the beach for toward shore, A.V. This verse, so obscure before, has been made intelligible by the masterly labors of Smith, of Jordan Hill. We will first explain the separate words. Casting off (περιελόντες). The verb περριαιρέω occurs in ver. 20; in 2 Corinthians 3:16; and in Hebrews 10:11; and in all those passages is rendered \"taken away.\" So also in the LXX., where it is of frequent use, it means \"take away,\" \"put away,\" \"remove,\" and the like. In classical Greek it means to \"take away,\" \"take off,\" \"strip off.\" Here, then, applied to the anchors which were firmly embedded in the very strong clay at the bottom of the sea off Koura Point, περιελόντες τὰς ἀγκύρας means \"putting away\" or \"casting off\" the anchors by cutting the cables which fastened them to the ship, and, as it follows, leaving them in the sea, or, more literally, giving them up, dismissing them into the sea (εἴων εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν); comp. Acts 5:38. Loosing the bands of the rudders. \"The ships of the Greeks and Romans, like those of the early Northmen were not steered by a single rudder, but by two paddle-rudders\" (Howson, p. 310. See too an illustration from an ancient painting found at Herculaneum, in which the two paddle-rudders are very distinctly seen, at p. 346; and another illustration in Lewin, vol. it. p. 204, showing the two rudders and the foresail). These paddle-rudders had been hoisted up and lashed, lest they should foul the anchors at the stern. But now, when the free use of them was absolutely necessary to steer the ship toward the beach, they unloosed the lashings, i.e. \"the bands of the rudders,\" and at the same time they hoisted up the foresail. The foresail; τὸν ἀρτέμονα, a word found only here in this sense, but used in Vitruvius for a \"pulley,\" and so explained in Ducange. But artimon was till recently used in Venice and Genoa as the name of the large sail of a vessel. In the Middle Ages artimonium was the \"foremast,\" mat de prone; but it was also used of the foresail,\" Velum naris breve, quod quia melius levari potest, in summo periculo extenditur\" (Ducange). They hoisted the foresail both to give them sufficient way to run on to the beach, and to give precision to their steering. (For a further account of the ἀρτεμών, or foresail, see Smith, of Jordan Hill.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - But lighting upon for and falling taro, A.V.; vessel for ship, A.V.; fore-ship for forepart, A.V.; struck for stuck fast, A.V.; stern for hinder part, A.V.; began to break up for was broken with, A.V. Where two seas met; τόπον διθάλασσον, only here, and in Dion Chrysostomus. The explanation of this \"place where two seas met\" is as follows: - As the ship stood at anchor in the bay on the north-east side of the island, it would have the Koura Point (Ras el-Kaura) on its left, and on entering deeper into the bay westward, the little island of Salmonetta, or Selmoon, otherwise called Gzeier, would lie on its right, and would appear to be part of the island of Malta, from which it is separated by a narrow channel about a hundred yards in width. When, however, she was just coming upon the beach for which she was making, she would come opposite to this open channel, and the sea from the north would break upon her and meet the sea on the south side of the island, where the ship was. Here, then, they ran the vessel aground. Ἐπώκειλαν, or, according to the R.T., ἐπέκειλαν, is only found here in the Bible; but it is the regular word for running a ship aground, or ashore, in classical writers. Ἐπικέλλω has exactly the same meaning. The simple verbs κἑλλω and ὀκέλλω are also both in use for running a ship to land. The foreship struck; ἐρείσασα, here only in the Bible, but very common in classical Greek. Its meaning here is not very different from its frequent medical meaning of a disease \"fixing itself\" and \"settling\" in some particular part of the body. Remained unmovable. \"A ship impelled by the force of a gale into a creek with a bottom such as that laid down in Admiral Smyth's chart of St. Paul's Bay, would strike a bottom of mud graduating into tenacious clay, into which the forepart would fix itself and be held fast, whilst the stern was exposed to the force of the waves\" (Smith, p. 144). Unmovable; ἀσάλεῦτος, only here and Hebrews 12:28, in the Bible; but common in Greek writers in the sense of \"firm,\" \"unmovable.\" Began to break up (ἐλύετο, like solvo and dissolvo in Latin). The planks were loosened and disjoined. By the violence. The R.T. omits the words τῶν κυμάτων, and so has βία alone, somewhat like ὕβρις in ver. 21.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - The soldiers' counsel, etc. The same stern sense of duty in the Roman soldier as moved the keeper of the jail at Philippi to destroy himself when he thought his prisoners had escaped (Acts 16:27). The prisoners; by which we learn, as also in ver. 1, that there were other prisoners beside Paul going to be tried before Caesar at Rome (comp. Josephus's account ('Life,' sect. 3) of certain priests, friends of his, who were sent as prisoners to Rome, to be tried). Swim out; ἐκκολυμβάω, only here, but not uncommon in the same sense in classical Greek (see next verse). Escape; διαφύγοι, peculiar to St. Luke here, but it is the common medical word for a narrow escape from Illness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Desiring for willing, A.V.; stayed for kept, A.V.; overboard, and get first to the land for first into the sea, and get to land, A.V. To save Paul; διασῶσαι, and ver. 44 and Acts 28:1, 4; a word of very frequent medical use, employed six times by St. Luke, but only twice elsewhere in the New Testament (Matthew 14:26; 1 Peter 3:20). Swim; κοολυμβάω, here only in the Bible; though κολυμβήθρα, properly a swim-ruing-bath, rendered \"pool\" in the A.V., occurs five times in St. John's Gospel. The verb means \"to dive\" rather than \"to swim.\" Both the verb and the noun are used frequently in medical language for \"swimming in a bath,\" and ῤίπτειν σεαυτὸν (like ἀπορρίπτειν here) is the phrase for jumping into the bath.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs27:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.

Planks; σωνίσιν, only here and in the LXX. of 2 Kings 12:9 (for the \"lid\" of the box) and Song of Solomon 8:9 (for \"boards\"); very common in Homer and other Greek writers, for \"boards\" and \"planks\" of all kinds. They all escaped. In exact fulfillment of Paul's prediction in ver. 22. And thus ended the eventful voyage of about four hundred and eighty miles (as laid down in the charts) from Clauda to the Point of Koura on the north coast of Malta. It is one of the striking proofs of the identity of Melita with Malta, that the rate at which it is calculated that a large ship laying to in a gale would drift in twenty-four hours, viz. thirty-six miles, multiplied by thirteen and a half (the number of days occupied by the voyage), gives four hundred and eighty-six miles as the whole distance. (36X13.5 = 486) Smith thinks that the coincidence between \"the actual bearing of St. Paul's Bay from Clauda, and the direction in which the ship must have driven,\" with the wind blowing in the quarter we know it did,\" is, if possible, still more striking\" (pp. 127, 128).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.28":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - We for they, A.V. and T.R. (twice). Was called. It reads as if it was the answer to their question to the natives, \"What is this island called?\" Melita. That Melita is the island of Malta, and not Meleda off the coast of Dalmatia, is demonstrated in Smith's ' Voyage and Shipwreck of St. Paul,' and it is not worth while here to consider the arguments in favor of Meleda. Melita appears to be a Phoenician name, from the root in Hebrew מָלַט, to escape (Bochart, 'Canaan,' 1:26), meaning, therefore, a \"refuge,\" a harbor of refuge so called from sailors often running into Valetta during a gale; or possibly from מֶלֶ, clay, in Italian malta, from the clay which forms the bottom of the sea as you approach Malta, and which makes the anchorage so safe. It was originally colonized by Phoenicians, whether from Tyre or Carthage cannot be pronounced with certainty, though we know it was a Carthaginian possession at the time of the first Punic War. It fell into the hands of the Romans B.C. 218, and at the time of St. Paul's shipwreck was annexed to the province of Sicily. The population, however, was Phoenician or Punic, and probably knew little Greek or Latin. The name of a fountain in St. Paul's Bay, Ayn tal Razzul, \"The Apostle's Fountain,\" is said (Smith, p. 24) to be Phoenician. But this is extremely doubtful. It is far more probably, not to say certainly, the corrupt Africano-Arabic dialect of the island, as I venture to affirm on the high authority of Professor Wright. Gesenius is also distinctly of opinion that there are no remains of Phoenician in the Maltese, and that all the words in the Maltese language which have been thought to be Phoenician are really Arabic. Four genuine Phoenician inscriptions have, however, been found in the island ('Monument. Phoenic,' pars prima, pp. 90-111,252, and 341).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Barbarians for barbarous people, A.V.; common for little, A.V.; all for every one, A.V. Barbarians; i.e. not Greeks or Romans, or (in the mouth of a Jew) not Jews. The phrase had especial reference to the strange language of the \"barbarian.\" See St. Paul's use of it (Romans 1:14; 1 Corinthians 14:11; Colossians 3:11); and compare Ovid's saying ('Trist.,' 3:10, 37), \"Barbarus hic ego sum, quia non intelligor ulli;\" and that of Herodotus (2, 158), that the Egyptians call all barbarians who do not speak the Egyptian language(Kuinoel). The word is thought to be formed onomate-poetically, to express the confused sound which a strange language has in a man's ears. Kindness; φιλανθρωπία, here and Titus 3:4 (comp. Acts 27:3). Received us all. The whole party, numbering two hundred and seventy-six. The present rain, and... cold; showing that the gale still continued, and the wind was still north-east. The plight of the shipwrecked party must have been lamentable, drenched to the skin, with no change of clothes, a cold wind blowing. Probably the hearty meal they had taken on beard ship was the means of saving their lives.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But for and, A.V.; a viper came for there came a viper, A.V.; by reason of for out of, A.V. Had gathered; συστρέψαντος, only here and in the LXX. of Judges 11:3 and Judges 12:4, for \"to collect,\" \"gather together.\" But συστροφή (Acts 19:40; Acts 23:12) means \"a concourse,\" \"a conspiracy.\" In classical Greek συστρέφειν is \"to twist up together,\" to \"form into a compact body,\" and the like. A bundle of sticks; φρυγάνων πλῆθος. The word only occurs in the New Testament here; it means \"dry sticks,\" \"kindlers,\" any combustible material. In the LXX. it is used as the equi- valent of קַשׁ, straw or stubble (Isaiah 40:24; Isaiah 41:2, etc.), and for \"nettles\" (Job 30:7). Theophrastus seems to use it for plants smaller than a shrub ('Hist.,' Plant., 1:3, 1, quoted by Hobart). Lewin (vol. it. p. 208) writes as follows: - \"When in Malta in 1853, I went to St. Paul's Bay at the same season of the year as when the wreck occurred .... We noticed eight or nine stacks of small faggots, they consisted of a kind of thorny heather, and had evidently been cut for firewood.\" This is a conclusive answer, if any were needed, to the objection to Melita being Malta, drawn from the absence of wood in the island. But besides this, it is not a fact that even now there is no wood at all (see Lewin). A viper came out. It is objected that there are no vipers in Malta. But it is obvious that the condition of Malta now, a very thickly inhabited island (one thousand two hundred people to the square mile, Lewin, p. 208), is very different from what it was with a sparse population in the days of St. Paul. Vipers may well have been destroyed during one thousand eight hundred and sixty years. Lewin mentions that his traveling companions in 1853 started what they thought was a viper, which escaped into one of the bundles of heather. Came out. Διεξελθοῦσα is the reading of Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, eta., \"came out through the sticks.\" It is a frequent medical term. The heat; τῆς θέρμης. This form of the word is only used here in the New Testament, instead of the more common θερμότης. It occurs, however, repeatedly in the LXX. (Job 6:17; Psalm 19:7; Ecclus. 38:34, etc.), and was the usual medical word for feverish heat. Fastened; κάθηψε, here only in the Bible; but not uncommon in classical Greek, and of general use among medical writers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Beast for venomous beast, A.V.; hanging from for hang on, A.V.; one to another for among themselves, A.V.; escaped from for escaped, A.V.; justice for vengeance, A.V.; hath not suffered for suffereth not, A.V. The beast (τὸ θηρίον). It is peculiar to medical writers to use θηρίον ασ synonymous with ἔχιδνα, a viper. So also θηριόδηκτος, bit by a viper, θηριακή, an antidote to the bite of a viper (Dioscorides, Galen, etc.). Justice (ἥ Δίκη). In Greek mythology Dice (Justitia) was the daughter and assessor of Zeus, and the avenger of crime. In her train was Poena, of whom Horace says,\" Rare antecedeutem scelcstum Deseruit pede Poena claude\" ('Od.,' 3:2, 32). \"The idea of Dice as justice personified is most perfectly developed in the dramas of Sophocles and Euripides\" (article \"Dice,\" in 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Biog. and Mythol.'). It does not appear whether the islanders had learned the name and office of Dice from the Greeks in Sicily, or whether they had any native divinity whose name St. Luke translates into that of Dice. The gods whose names are found in ancient Maltese inscriptions are Melkarth, another name of Hercules, the tutelar god of Tyre; Osiris, and Baal. Other Phoenician divinities are named in the Carthaginian inscriptions (see Gesenius, 'Monument. Phoenic.'). Had not suffered. They assume that death will certainly follow from the bite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Howbeit for and, A.V.; look for felt, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But they expected that he would for howbeit, they looked when he should, A.V.; when they were long in expectation for after they had looked a great while, A.V.; beheld nothing amiss for stay no harm, A.V. They expected; προσεδόκων. This word is used eleven times by St. Luke, twice by St. Matthew, and three times in the Second Epistle of Peter (see Acts 3:5; Luke 1:21, etc.). It is also common in the LXX. But it is a word much employed by medical writers in speaking of the course they expect a disease to take, and the results they look for. And this is the more remarkable here because there are no fewer than three other medical phrases in this verse, τίμπρασθαι καταπίπτειν, and μηδὲν ἄτοπον, besides those immediately preceding διεξέρχεσθαι (according to several good manuscripts and editions) θέρμη καθάπτειν, and θηρίον. So that it looks as if, having once got into a medical train of thought from the subject he was writing about, medical language naturally came uppermost in his mind. Have swollen; πίμπρασθαι, only here in the Bible, and not found in this sense in older classical writers. But it is the usual medical word for \"inflammation\" in any part of the body. Fallen down; καταπίπτειν, only here and in Acts 26:14, and twice in the LXX.; but common in Homer and elsewhere, and especially frequent in medical writers of persons falling down in fits, or weakness, or wounded, or the like. Nothing amiss (μηδὲν ἄτοπον). Mr. Hobart quotes a remarkable parallel to this phrase from Damocrites, quoted by Galen. He says that whosoever, having been bitten by a mad dog, drinks a certain antidote (εἰς οὐδὲν ἄτοπον ἐμπεσοῦται ῤᾳδίως), \"shall suffer no harm.\" It is used in medical writers in two senses - of\" unusual symptoms,\" and of fatal consequences. In the New Testament it only occurs elsewhere in Luke 23:41, \"Nothing amiss;\" and 2 Thessalonians 3:2, Ἀτόπων καὶ πονηρῶν ἀνθρώπων. It is also used in the LXX. for wickedness, doing wickedly, etc. They changed their minds; as in an opposite direction the Lycaonians did (Acts 14:11, 19). It is a graphic picture of the fickleness of an untutored mind yielding to every impulse. The impunity with which St. Paul endured the bite of the viper was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise in Mark 16:18 (see further note on ver. 8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Now in the neighborhood of that place for in the same quarters, A.V.; lands belonging to for possessions of, A.V.; named for whose name was, A.V.; entertained for lodged, A.V. Lands (χωρία); so John 4:5; Actsi. 18,19; 4:34; 5:3,8. The chief man of the island (τῷ πρώτει τῆς νήσου). It appears that, with his usual accurate knowledge gained on the spot (see Acts 16:22. note), St. Luke here gives to Publius his peculiar official title of primus. For Ciantar (1. 215), quoted by Smith, gives a Greek inscription on a marble, which in his day was standing near the gates of Citta Vecehia, in Malta, in which are the words, Προύδενς ἵππευς Ρωμ πρῶτος Μελιταίων κ.τ.λ., \"Prudens, a Roman knight, chief of the Maltese.\" The Latin inscription, which was discovered in 1747, has the same title, MEL PRIMUS. \"chief of the Maltese.\" It may not improbably be the Greek and Latin translation of the old Phoenician title of the \"headman,\" in Hebrew הָרלֺאשׁ, in Chaldee ראֵשׁ, as in the title ראֵשׂ הַגְלוּתָה, the chief of the Captivity. When the Romans succeeded the Carthaginians in the possession of the island, they would be likely to perpetuate the title of the chief magistrate. In this case the chief was also a Roman, as his name of Publius indicates. Alford says that he was legatus to the Praetor of Sicily, and so 'Speaker's Commentary,' Kuinoel, Meyer, ere.' Received us; ἀναδεξάμενος, only here (and Hebrews 11:17 in a different sense) for the more common ὑποδέχομαι. Kuinoel quotes from AElian, 'Var. Hist.,' 4, 19, the similar phrase, Υπέδεξατο αὐτοὺς. . . φιλοφρόνως: and from 2 Macc. 3:9, Φιλοφρόνως ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀρχιερέως ὑποδεχθείς. Entertained us (ἐξένισεν); see Acts 10:6, 18, 23, 32; Acts 21:16; and in the active voice in Hebrews 13:2. Courteously; φιλοφρόνως, only here in the New Testament, but we find φιλόφρων, courteous, in 1 Peter 3:8. We must understand the \"us\" probably to include the centurion, St. Paul, St. Luke, Aristarchus, and possibly one or two others, but not the whole two hundred and seventy-six. Hebrews 13:2 had a striking fulfillment here. During the three days they would have opportunity to procure suitable winter quarters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - It was so for it came to pass, A.V.; fever for a fever, A.V.; dysentery for of a bloody flux, A.V.; unto for to, A.V.; and laying, etc., healed for and laid, etc., and healed, A.V. The father of Publius. The fact of the father of Publius being alive and living in Malta is a further indication that the term ὁ πρῶτος τῆς νήσου ισ an official title. Lay sick. Συνέχεσθαι ισ also the usual medical expression for being taken sick of any disease (see the numerous passages quoted by Hobart, pp. 3, 4, from Galen and Hippocrates). It is used by St. Luke, with πυρετῴ (Luke 4:38), and in the same sense in Matthew 4:24. Lay. Κατακεῖσθαι is used especially of lying in bed from sickness (see Mark 1:30; Mark 2:4; Luke 5:25; Acts 9:33). It answers to decumbo in Latin. Sick of fever and dysentery (πυρετοῖς καὶ δυσεντερία συνεχόμενον). The terms here used are all professional ones. Πυρετός, in the plural, is of frequent occurrence in Hippocrates, Aretaeus, and Galen, but elsewhere in the New Testament always in the singular; δυσεντερία, only found here in the New Testament, is the regular technical word for a \"dysentery,\" and is frequently in medical writers coupled with πυρετοί or πυρετός, as indicating different stages of the same illness. Laying his hands on him. So Mark 16:18, \"They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover\" (see also Matthew 9:18; Matthew 19:13, 15; Mark 5:23; Mark 6:5; Mark 7:32; Mark 8:23, 25; Luke 4:40; Luke 13:13; Acts 9:12). It is also spoken of as an accompaniment of prayer in confirmation, ordination, etc. It has been remarked as curious that the two actions of taking up serpents and healing the sick by the laying on of hands should be in such close juxtaposition both here and in Mark 16:18. It suggests the thought whether Luke had seen the passage in St. Mark; or whether the writer of Mark 16:18 had seen Acts 28:8. Or is the coincidence accidental, arising out of the facts?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - And for so, A.V. and T.R.; the rest for others, A.V.; cured for healed, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Sailed for departed, A.V.; put on board for laded us with, A.V.; we needed for were necessary, A.V. Honored us with many honors. Kuinoel understands this in the sense of \"gifts, presents,\" which of course their destitute condition, after losing all they had in the ship-wreck, would make very acceptable. But there is nothing in the words to suggest this meaning, and, had it been so, Luke would have simply stated it, as he does immediately afterwards, when he says that they put on board such things as we needed. When we sailed (ἀναγομένοις); see Acts 13:13; Acts 16:11; Acts 18:21; Acts 20:3, 13; Acts 21:1, 2, 4, 12, 21, and notes. It is touching to see the kindness of the Maltese, and we may hope that they had to thank God for light and grace and life through the ministry of St. Paul and his companions.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Set sail for departed, A.V.; island for isle, A.V.; The Twin Brothers for Castor and Pollux, A.V. After three months. At the very earliest period when the sailing season began after the winter. It would be, perhaps, about the middle of February, or, as Alford thinks, about March 10. If the weather was fine, having so short a voyage before them, they would venture to sail without further delay. Set sail (see preceding verso, note). A ship of Alexandria. Some ship, better fated than that one (Acts 27:6) which was wrecked in St. Paul's Bay, which had weathered or avoided the gale, and probably got into the harbor of Valetta in good time. One would have thought that this ship wintering at Malta on its way from Alexandria to Italy, via Sicily, would be of itself a sufficient proof that Melita was Malta. Which had wintered (παρακεχειμακότι); see Acts 27:12, note. Whose sign was The Twin Brothers (Δίοσκουροι, Latin the constellation Gemini). The twin sons of Jupiter and Leda, Castor and Pollux, brothers of Helena (\"fratres Helenis, lucida sidera,\" Horace, 'Od.,' 1:3, 2), were called by the Greeks Dioscuri, the sons of Jove. It was their special office to assist sailors in danger of shipwreck. Hence Horace, in the ode just quoted, prays that Castor and Pollux, in conjunction with other deities, would carry the ship in which Virgil sailed safe to Attica. And in Ode 12:27, etc., he describes the subsidence of the storm, and the calming of the waves, at the appearance of the twin stars, of Leda's sons. It was, therefore, very natural to have the Dioscuri for the παράσημον, the sign of the ship. Every ancient ship had a παράσημον, \"a painted or carved representation of the sign which furnished its name on the prow, and at the stern a similar one of their tutelary deity.\" (Alford), which was called the tutela. These were sometimes the same, and perhaps were so in this instance. Ovid tells us that Minerva was the tutela of the ship in which he sailed, and that her painted helmet gave it its name ('Trist.,' 1 9:1), Galea, or the like. We may notice the continual trial to Jews and Christians of having to face idolatry in all the common actions of life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Touching for landing, A.V. Touching (καταχθέντες); Acts 21:3; Acts 27:3, note. The way in which Syracuse is here mentioned is another redundant proof that Melita is Malta. \"Syracause is about eighty miles, a days' sail, from Malta\" (Afford). Tarried there three days. Perhaps wind- bound, or possibly having to land part of their cargo there.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Made a circuit for fetched a compass, A.V.; arrived at for came to, A.V.; a south for the south, A.V.; sprang up for blew, A.V.; on the second day we came for we came the next day, A.V. We made a circuit; περιελθόντες. St. Luke only uses this word in one other passage, Acts 19:13,\" The strolling [or, 'vagabond'] Jews;\" and it has the same sense of \"wandering\" in the only other passages where it occurs in the New Testament (1 Timothy 5:13; Hebrews 11:37). If it is the right reading here, the meaning must be \"tacking,\" the wind not allowing them to sail in a direct course. \"I am inclined to suppose that the wind was north-west, and that they worked to windward, availing themselves of the sinuosities of the coast. But with this wind they could not proceed through the Straits of Messina .... They were, therefore, obliged to put into Rhegium But after one day the wind became fair (from the south), and on the following day they arrived at Puteoli, having accomplished about one hundred and eighty nautical miles in less than two days\" (Smith, p. 156). But Meyer explains it, \"after we had come round,\" viz. from Syracuse, round the eastern coast of Sicily. Lewin thinks they had to stand out to sea to catch the wind, and so arrived at Rhegium by a circuitous course. The other reading is περιελόντες, as in Acts 27:40; but this seems to give no proper sense here. A south wind sprang up. The force of the preposition in ἐπιγενομένου shows that there was a change of wind. The south wind would, of course, be a very favorable one for sailing from Reggio to Puzzuoli. Hobart remarks of ἐπιγίνεσθαι (which is also found in Acts 27:27, according to some good manuscripts) that it \"was a favorite medical word constantly employed to denote the coming on of an attack of illness.\" It occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but is common in Diodorus Siculus, Xenophon, Herodotus, Thucydides, etc., for the coming on of a storm, wind (adverse or favorable), or any other change. On the second day; δευτεραῖοι. This particular numeral occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but the analogous τεταρταῖος is used in John 11:39. And Herodotus has τριταῖος ἀφίκετο, \"he went away on the third day.\" Τριταῖος is also common in medical writers with πυρετός, a tertian ague, a fever that recurs on the third day; τεταρταῖος, a quartan fever; πεμπταῖος, one recurring on the fifth day; ἑβδομαῖος, on the seventh day; ἐνναταῖος, on the ninth day. The forms δεκαταῖος πεντηκοσταῖος, etc., \"doing anything on the tenth, the fiftieth day,\" also occur. Puteoli; now Puzzuoli. The Italian port to which ships from Alexandria usually came. Smith quotes a passage from Seneca (Epist., 77) describing the arrival of the Alexandrian wheat-ships at Puteoli. The whole population of Puteoli went out to see them sail into harbor with their topsails (supparum), which they alone were allowed to carry, in order to hasten their arrival (p. 157), so important to Italy was the corn trade with Alexandria.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhere we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Intreated for desired, A.V.; came to for went toward, A.V. Brethren. It is very interesting to find the gospel already planted in Italy. The circumstances of Purcell as the great emporium of African wheat made it a likely place for Christianity to reach, whether from Rome or from Alexandria (see Acts 18:24). Luke calls them ἀδελφοί, not Ξριστιανοί (Acts 11:26). Perhaps the name of Christian was still rather the name given by those without, and that of \"brethren,\" or \"disciples,\" the name used by the Christians among themselves. What a joy it must have been to Paul and his companions to find themselves among brethren! Seven days. Surely that they might take part in the service and worship of the next Sunday (see Acts 20:6, 7). It is implied that the philanthropy of Julius (Acts 27:3) did not now fail. So we came to Rome. The R.V. is undoubtedly right. 'We can trace in the anticipatory form of speech here used by St. Luke, simple as the words are, his deep sense of the transcendent interest of the arrival of the apostle of the Gentiles at the colossal capital of the heathen world. Yes; after all the conspiracies of the Jews who sought to take away his life, after the two years' delay at Caesarea, after the perils of that terrible shipwreck, in spite of the counsel of the soldiers to kill the prisoners, and in spite of the \"venomous beast,\" - Paul came to Rome. The word of God,\" Thou must bear witness also at Rome\" (Acts 23:11), had triumphed over all \"the power of the enemy\" (Luke 10:19). And doubtless the hearts both of Paul and Luke beat quicker when they first caught sight of the city on the seven hills.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The brethren, when, etc., came for when the brethren, etc., they came, A.V.; The Market of Appius for Appii forum, A.V. The brethren, when they heard of us. During the seven days' stay at Putcoli, the news of the arrival of the illustrious confessors reached the Church at Rome. The writer of that wonderful Epistle which they had received some three years before, and in which he had expressed his earnest desire to visit them, and his hope that he should come to them in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ (Romans 1:11, 12, 15; Romans 15:22, 24, 28-32), was now almost at their gates as a prisoner of state, and they would soon see him face to face. They naturally determined to go and meet him, to honor him as an apostle, and show their love to him as a brother. The younger and more active would go as far as Appii Forum, \"a village on the Via Appia, forty-three miles from Rome\" (Meyer). The rest only came as far as The Three Taverns, ten miles nearer to Rome. Alford quotes a passage from Cicero's letters to Atticus (it. 10), in which he mentions both \"Appii Forum\" and the \"Tres Tabernae;\" and refers to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 17. 12:1) for a similar account of Jews at Rome, who, on hearing of the arrival of the pretended Alexander at Puteoli, went out in a body to meet him (πᾶν τὸ Ιουδαίων πλῆθος ὑπαντιάζοντες ἐξῄεσαν). He also quotes from Suetonius the passage in which he tells us that, on Caligula's return from Germany, \"populi Romans sexum, aetatem, ordinem omnem, usque ad Vicesimum lapidem effadisse se\" ('Calig.,' c. 4). Appii Forum was not far from the coast, and was a great place for sailors and innkeepers (Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:5, 3). The Via Appia was made by Appius Claudius, B.C. 442. It led from the Ports Capena in Rome through the Pontino marshes to Capua.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Entered into for came to, A.V. and T.R.; the words which follow in the T.R. and the A.V., the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but, are omitted in the R.T. and R.V., following א, A, B, and many versions; Alford retains them, Meyer speaks doubtfully; abide for dwell, A.V.; the soldier that guarded him for a soldier that kept him, A.V. The captain of the guard (A.V.); τῷ στρατοπεδάρχῃ: in Latin praefectus praetorio (Στρατόπεδον, was the Greek name for the castra praetoriana). There were usually two great officers so called, and it was their special duty to take charge of prisoners sent from the provinces to be tried at Rome. 'Vinctus mitti ad praefectos praetorii met debet\" (Pliny, 'Epist.,' 10:65). It has been argued, from the mention of \"the captain of the guard,\" that Paul's imprisonment must have occurred when Burrus was sole prefect, as related by Tacitus ('Annal.,' 12:42, 1), and that hence we get a precise date for it (so Wieseler, 'Chronologic de Apostolisch. Geshichte'). But this can hardly be depended upon. Luke might speak of \"the prefect,\" meaning the one to whom the prisoners were actually committed, just as we might speak of a magistrate writing to \"the secretary of state,\" or an ambassador calling upon \"the secretary of state,\" the matter in hand determining which of the three secretaries we meant. With the soldier that guarded him. It appears from ver. 20 that St. Paul was subjected to the custodia militaris, i.e. that he was fastened by a single chain to a praetorian (στρατιώτης), but, as a special favor, granted probably on the good report of the courteous Julius, was allowed to dwell in his own hired house (ver. 30); see Acts 24:23.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He for Paul, A.V. and T.R.; called together those that were the chief for called the chief... together, A.V.; I, brethren, though I had done for men and brethren, though I have committed, A.V. and T.R.; the customs for customs, A.V.; was I for was, A.V. After three days. He could but just have got into his hired house, but he would not lose a day in seeking out his brethren to speak to them of the hope of Israel. What marvelous activity! what unquenchable love! The chief (τοὺς ὄντας... πρώτους). The expression οἱ πρῶτοι, for the principal people of the district or neighborhood, occurs repeatedly in Josephus. The Jews. They had returned to Rome, after their banishment by Claudius (Acts 18:2), some time before this (Romans 16:3, 7). I had done nothing against the people, or the customs (comp. Acts 23:1, 6; Acts 24:14-16, 20, 21; Acts 25:8; Acts 26:6, 7, 22, 23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Desired to set me at liberty for would have let me go, A.V.

This is a detail not expressly mentioned in the direct narrative in Acts 25, but which makes that narrative clearer. It shows us that Festus's proposal in Acts 25:9 was made in consequence of the opposition of the Jews to the acquittal which he was disposed to pronounce. I was constrained to appeal. Nothing can be more delicate, more conciliatory, or more truly patriotic than Paul's manner of addressing the Jews. Himself a Hebrew of the Hebrews, devoted to his kinsmen according to the flesh, never even putting forward his own privilege as a Roman citizen till the last necessity, he shows himself the constant friend of his own people in spite of all their ill usage. Undazzled by the splendor of Rome and the power of the Roman people, his heart is with his own despised nation, \"that they might be saved.\" He wishes to he well with them; he wants them to understand his position; he speaks to them as a kinsman and a brother. His appeal to Caesar had been of necessity - to save his life. But he was not going to accuse his brethren before the dominant race. His first desire was that they should be his friends, and share with him the hope of the gospel of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Did I entreat you to see and to speak with me for have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you, A.V.; for because of for because that for, A.V. To see and to speak with me. Meyer, followed by Alford, rightly prefers the rendering of the A.V. and the margin of the R.V. Παρακαλέω is here in its primary sense of calling any one to come to you, and the two infinitives express the object for which he called them, viz. to see and speak with them. Because of the hope of Israel (see Acts 23:6; Acts 24:14, 15, 21; Acts 26:6, 22, 23). I am bound with this chain (περικεῖμαι). In Mark 9:42 and Luke 17:2 the millstone 'hangs about' (περικεῖται) the neck. But here and Hebrews 5:2 the construction is different, and the subject and the object are reversed. Instead of the chain encompassing Paul, Paul is said to be bound with the chain. (For the chain, see ver. 16, note, and Acts 24:23.) The force of this saying seems to be this, \"I have asked you to come to me because this chain which binds me is not a token of a renegade Israelite who has come to Rome to accuse his nation before the heathen master, but of a faithful Israelite, who has endured bondage rather than forsake the hope of his fathers.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - From for out of, A.V.; nor for neither, A.V.; did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak for any of the brethren that came showed or spake, A.V. Nor did any of the brethren come hither, etc. This is no improvement on the A.V.; for it implies that they denied that any special messenger had been sent to speak harm of Paul, which nobody could have thought had been done. What they meant to say is exactly what the A.V. makes them say, viz. that, neither by special letters, nor by message nor casual information brought by Jews coming to Rome from Judaea, had they heard any harm of him. This seems odd; but as the Jews had no apparent motive for not speaking the truth, we must accept it as true. The expulsion of the Jews from Rome by Claudius (Acts 18:1) may have slackened the intercourse between Judaea and Rome; the attention of the Jews may have been absorbed by their accusation of Felix; there had been a very short interval between Paul's appeal and his departure for Rome; he had only been at Rome three days, and so it is very possible that no report had yet reached Rome concerning him at this early season of the year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - It is known to us for we know, A.V. We desire (ἀξιοῦμεν); or, we are willing; literally, think it right (so Acts 16:38). Ηξίου, followed by a negative, means \"was unwilling.\" It has this sense frequently in Xenophon, AElian, Josephus, and other Greek writers (see Kuinoel, on Acts 16:30). This sect (τῆς αἱρέσεως ταύτης); see Acts 24:5, 14, notes. It is known to us; i.e. though we have heard nothing against you Paul, we have heard of the sect of the Nazarenes and have heard nothing but harm concerning it. Spoken against (ἀντιλέγεται); see Acts 13:45; ver. 19; Romans 10:21; Titus 1:9. It is called a \"superstitio prava, malefica, exitiabilis\" (Pliny, 'Ep.,' 10:96; Suetonius, 'Nero,' 16; Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 15:44; 'Speaker's Commentary').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - They came to him into his lodging in great number for there came many to him into his lodging, A.V.; expounded the matter for expounded, A.V.; testifying for and testified, A.V.; and persuading for persuading, A.V.; from for out of (twice), A.V. His lodging; ξενία, elsewhere only in Philemon 1:22. It may well be the same as the \"hired dwelling\" in ver. 30. Expounded (ἐξετίθετο). The verb governs the accusative τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ, as in Acts 18:26, and is not intransitive, as in Acts 11:4. Testifying; διαμαρτυράμενος, a favorite word of St. Luke's, most commonly intransitive, and so to be taken here. It qualifies the verb (see Luke 16:28; Acts 2:40; Acts 8:25; Acts 10:42; Acts 20:23; Acts 23:11). It is transitive in Acts 20:21, 24; doubtful in Acts 18:5. The kingdom of God. The great subject-matter of the gospel in all its parts - grace, righteousness, glory, through Jesus Christ (see ver. 31 and Acts 20:25). From the Law of Moses and from the prophets (see Luke 24:27, 44). From morning till evening. So do the Jews frequent the houses of the missionaries to this day, and listen with great interest and apparent earnestness to their teaching.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Disbelieved for believed not, A.V.

When they agreed not; ἀσύμφωνοι ὄντες, only here in the New Testament; but συμφωνέω to agree, occurs repeatedly (Luke 5:36; Acts 5:9; Acts 15:15; and Matthew, pass.); also σύμφωνος and συμφώνησις (1 Corinthians 7:5; 2 Corinthians 6:15). Ἀσύμφωνος occurs in Wisd. 18:10 and in classical writers. Probably the disagreement led to some altercation, and to the exhibition of the usual bigotry and prejudice and bitter opposition on the part of the unbelieving Jews. They departed; ἀπελύοντο, the proper word for the breaking up of an assembly (Matthew 14:15, 22, 23; Matthew 15:32, 39; Acts 15:30; Acts 19:41, etc.). Well spake the Holy Ghost. Note the distinct assertion of the inspiration of Isaiah. Compare the words of the Creed, \"Who spake by the prophets;\" and for similar statements, see Mark 12:36; Hebrews 3:7; Hebrews 10:15, etc. Note also how resolutely St. Paul maintains his own standpoint as the faithful and consistent Israelite in accord with Moses and the prophets, while his adversaries, with their boasted zeal for the Law, were really its antagonists. The attitude of the true Catholics, in protesting against the corruptions and perversions of the Church of Rome, and showing that they are the faithful followers of Scripture and of apostolic tradition, and the true up holders of the primitive discipline and doctrine of the Church, is very similar.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Go thou for go, A.V.; by hearing for hearing, A.V.; in no wise for not, A.V.; shall in no wise for not, A.V. Go thou, etc. The quotation is all but verbatim from the LXX. of Isaiah 6:9, 10. This particular chapter was evidently deemed one of great importance, since our Lord quotes from it (Matthew 13:14, 15), and St. John (John 12:37-41), as well as St. Paul in the passage before us. By hearing (ἀκοῇ). Why the LXX. translated שָׁמועַ by the substantive (ἀκοῇ) instead of by the participle (ἀκούοντες), as in the precisely similar phrase which follows - βλέποντες βλέψατε - does not appear. The Hebrew reads, as it is rendered in the A.V.,\" Hear ye,... and see ye,\" etc., in the imperative mood, not differing much in sense (in prophetical language) from the future. It is impossible to give the force in English exactly of the repetition of the verb in the infinitive mood שְׁמְעוּ שָׁמועַ, and רְאוּ רָאו by a very common Hebrew idiom. It is done imperfectly by the word \"indeed.\" Rosenmuller quotes from Demosthenes ('Contr. Aristogit.,' 1.) the proverbial saying, Ὁρώντας μὴ ὁρᾳν καὶ ἀκούονσας μὴ ἀκούεινNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - This people's heart for the heart of this people, A.V.; they have for have they, A.V.; lest haply they should perceive for lest they should see, A.V.; turn again for be con-vetted, A.V. This people's heart, etc. So the LXX. But the Hebrew has the imperative form, \"make fat.,\" \"make heavy.... shut,\" in the prophetical style (comp. Jeremiah 1:10). They have closed (ἐκάμμυσαν). The verb καμμύω, contracted from καταμύω (μύω, to close, from the action of the lips in pronouncing the sound μυ), means \"to shut\" or \"close\" the eyes. It is found repeatedly in the LXX., and, in the form καταμύω, in classical writers. The word \"mystery\" is etymologically connected with it. The word here expresses the willfulness of their unbelief: \"Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - This salvation for the salvation, A.V. and T.R.; they will also hear for and that they will hear it, A.V.

The Gentiles (see Acts 13:46; Acts 18:6; Acts 22:26; Acts 26:17, 20, 23).

Great reasoning (πολλὴν συζήτησιν see Acts 15:2, 7; and Luke 22:23; Luke 24:15; Acts 6:9; Acts 9:29).

The word properly means \"hire,\" the price paid for the use of anything, and then by metonymy \"the thing which is hired.\" It occurs frequently in the LXX. in the sense of\" hire\" or\" wages;\" e.g. ties. 2:12; Deuteronomy 23:18, etc. This may be the ξενία spoken of in ver. 23, or he may have removed from thence into stone house more commodious for gathering Jews and Christians around him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs28:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPreaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - The things for those things, A.V.; concerning for which concern, A.V.; boldness for confidence, A.V.; none for no man, A.V. Boldness (παρρησίας); see above, Acts 2:29; Acts 4:13, 29, 31. The verb παρρησιάζομαι also occurs frequently (Acts 9:27; Acts 13:46; Acts 14:3, etc.). The boldness and freedom with which he spake the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ would naturally increase more and more, as he found himself day by day unchecked by enemies, and encouraged by the number and earnestness of his hearers. None forbidding him; ἀκωλύτως, only here in the New Testament; but the adjective is found in Symmachus's version of Job (Job 34:31), and in the LXX. of Wisd. 7:22; and both adjective and adverb are occasionally used in classical Greek. But the most common use of the adverb is by medical writers, who employ it \"to denote freedom, unhindered action, in a variety of things, such as respiration, perspiration, the pulse, the muscles, the members of the body\" (Hobart). In two passages quoted from Galen ('Meth. Med.,' 14:15; 'Usus Part.,' 2:15) the sentence ends, as here, with the word ἀκωλύτως Some derive the word \"acolyte\" hence, from their being admitted to holy functions, though not in full orders. And so ends this lively and beautiful and most faithful sketch of one of the greatest men, and one of the greatest works, the world has ever seen. \"In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft,\" is seen, as we read this history, to be no empty boast, but a simple statement of the truth. The springs of that mind and of that zeal were ever ready to rise to fresh work, however crushing a strain had been put upon them. \"I count not my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God,\" is the true description of that life as delineated by the beloved physician. And yet how remarkable it is that in the whole of the Acts there is not one single word of panegyric! The portraiture is a bare photograph, without a single additional touch to enhance its beauty. Nor must we forget the singular brevity with which some episodes are passed over. Had we only Luke's history, we should not know that the apostle was an author - an author whose writings have moved the world of mind and spirit more than all the writings of Plato, and Aristotle, and Cicero, and Bacon combined, through a period of eighteen hundred years. Thus, to glance at the \"two whole years\" with the record of which the book closes, think of the work clone in that time. What gatherings of holy men and women within the walls of that \"hired dwelling\" are we sure must have taken place! Prisca and Aquila, and Epaenetus, and Mary, and Urban, and Apelles, and Persis, and Hermas, and Olympas, and all their compeers, we may be sure were often there. What wrestlings in prayer, what expositions of the Scriptures, what descriptions of the kingdom of God, what loving exhortations, what sympathetic communings, must have made that \"hired dwelling\" a very Bethel in the stronghold of heathenism! We think of the praetorian soldiers to whom he was successively chained; perhaps of the courteous Julius; of the inmates of Nero's palace (Philippians 4:22); perhaps of Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia (2 Timothy 4:21); of Epaphras and Epaphroditus, and of Luke, and Mark, and Timothy, and Aristarchus, and we know not how many more besides; and there rises before our minds a crowd of agencies and sober activities directed by that master mind to the advancement of the kingdom of God. We feel, indeed, that, though he was chained, \"the word of God was not bound;\" but that through the marvelous energy and unfailing wisdom of the great prisoner, his prison turned out rather to the furtherance of the gospel. And then we turn to the Epistles written at this time. What a contribution to the literature of the kingdom of heaven!-the Epistles to the Ephesians, to the Colossions, to Philemon, and to the Philippians, and probably much help given to Luke in the composition of the Acts of the Apostles. Truly they were two years of infinite moment to the Church of God. What followed those two years, what became of Paul, and what of his saintly biographer, we shall never know. It has pleased God to draw a curtain ever the events, which we cannot penetrate. Here our history ends, because nothing more had happened when it was given to the Church. Instead of vain regrets because it reaches no further, let us devoutly thank God for all that this book has taught us, and strive to show ourselves worthy members of that Gentile Church, whose foundation by St. Peter and St. Paul, and whose marvelous increment, through the labors of him who once laid it waste, has been so well set before us in the Book of THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Was now come for was fully come, A.V.; all together for with one accord, A.V. and T.R. When the day of Pentecost was now come; literally, when the day of Pentecost - i.e., of the fiftieth day - was in the course of being completed. The fiftieth day (reckoned from the end of the 16th of Nisan, on which Jesus was crucified) was actually come, but was not ended (comp. Luke 9:11). All together; ὁμοῦ for ὁμοθυμαδόν: but ὁμοθυμαδόν - a favorite word in the Acts (Acts 4:24, note) - seems preferable to ὁμοῦ, which occurs only in St. John. In one place (see Acts 1:15, note). The purpose, doubtless, of their coming together was for prayer, as in Acts 1:14; and the third hour (9 a.m., ver. 15), the hour of offering the morning sacrifice, was close at hand (comp. Acts 3:1 and Luke 1:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - From heaven a sound for a sound from heaven, A.V.; as of the rushing of a for as of a rushing, A.V. All the house; showing that it was in a private dwelling, not in the temple (as in Acts 3:1) that they were assembled (see Acts 2:46). Perhaps the word \"church\" (ὁ κυριακὸς οῖκος) derives its use from these early meetings of the disciples in a house, as distinguished from the temple (τὸ ἱερὸν).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Tongues parting asunder for cloven tongues, A.V.; each one for each, A.V. There appeared. They had heard the sound, now they see the tongues of fire, and then they feel the Spirit working in them (see ver. 34). Tongues parting asunder. The idea of the cloven tongue, i.e. a tongue parted into two, which is thought to have been the origin of the miter, is not suggested either by the Greek or by the circumstances, and is clearly a mistaken one. Διαμεριζόμεναι means distributing themselves or being distributed. From the central apparition, or rather place of sound, they saw issuing forth many several tongues, looking like small flames of fire, and one such tongue sat upon each one of the brethren or disciples present. Each one. That Chrysostom is right ('Hom.'4.) in interpreting the each one of this verse of the hundred and twenty, and not of the twelve, and the ell in ver. 4 of all present besides the apostles, may be demonstrated. For not only must the all of ver. 1 refer to the same company as was described in the preceding chapter (vers. 15-26), but it is quite clear in ver. 15 of this chapter that Peter and the eleven (ver. 14), standing up separate from the body of the disciples, say of them, \"These are not drunken, as ye suppose;\" which is a demonstration that those of whom they thus spoke had been speaking with tongues (see also Acts 10:44). St. Augustine, too, says that the hundred and twenty all received the Holy Spirit. To the same effect Meyer, Wordsworth, Alford (who adds, \"Not the hundred and twenty only, but all the believers in Christ then congregated at Jerusalem;\" so also Lange). Farrar well remarks, \"It was the consecration of a whole Church to be all of them a chosen generation, a royal priest- hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people\" ('Life of St. Paul,' Acts 5.). Lange says, \"Not only the apostles, but all the disciples, were filled with the Holy Ghost. There is a universal priesthood of all believers, and the Holy Ghost is the anointing which consecrates and qualifies for this priesthood\" ('On the Acts,' Clark's edit., p. 67).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Spirit for Ghost, A.V. Other tongues (1 Corinthians 14:21; Isaiah 28:11); the same as the \"new tongues\" of Mark 16:17. St. Paul speaks of them as \"the tongues of men and of angels\" (1 Corinthians 13:1), and as \"kinds of tongues\" (1 Corinthians 12:10). His habitual phrase is \"speaking in [or with] a tongue [or tongues]\" (1 Corinthians 14:2, 4-6, etc.), and the verb is always λαλεῖν, as here. What these tongues were on this occasion we are explicitly informed in vers. 6, 8, and 11. They were the tongues of the various nationalities present at the feast - Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Phrygians, Arabians, etc. This is so clearly and so distinctly stated that it is astonishing that any one should deny it who accepts St. Luke's account as historical. The only room for doubt is whether the speakers spoke in these divers languages, or the hearers heard in them though the speakers spoke in only one tongue. But not to mention that this is far more difficult to imagine, and transfers the miracle from those who had the Holy Spirit to those who had it not, it is against the plain language of the text, which tells us that \"they began to speak with other tongues,\" and that \"every man heard them speaking in his own language.\" \"Speaking,\" said they, \"in our own tongues the mighty works of God.\" There may, indeed, have been something ecstatic besides in these utterances, but there is no reference to such made either by St. Luke or by the audience whose words he reports. The narrative before us does not hint at any after use of the gift of tongues for missionary purposes. In Acts 10:46; Acts 11:15-17; Acts 19:6, as well as in the passages above referred to in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the speaking with tongues is always spoken of - often in connection with prophecy - simply as a gift and a manifestation (1 Corinthians 12:7) of the power of the Holy Spirit. In this case and in Acts 10:46 the subject-matter of the utterance is the greatness of God's works; τὰ μεγαλεῖα τοῦ Θεοῦ μεγαλυνόντων τὸν Θεὸν. In 1 Corinthians 14:2 it is\" mysteries;\" in ver. 15, \"prayers and psalms;\" in ver. 16 it is \"blessing\" and \"thanksgiving\" (εὐλογία and εὐχαριστία). But nowhere, either in Holy Scripture or in the Fathers of the three first centuries, is the gift of tongues spoken of in connection with preaching to foreign nations (see Alford's just remarks). Farrar ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 98-101) takes the same view, but is much less distinct in his conception of what is meant here by speaking with tongues. He adheres to the view of Schneckenburger, that \"the tongue was, from its own force and significance, intelligible equally to all who heard it;\" he agrees with the dictum of Neander that \"any foreign languages which were spoken on this occasion were only something accidental, and not the essential element of the language of the Spirit.\" He says, \"The voice they uttered was awful in its range, in its tones, in its modulations, in its startling, penetrating, almost appalling power; the words they spoke were exalted, intense, passionate, full of mystic significance; the language they used was not their ordinary and familiar tongue, but was Hebrew, or Greek, or Latin, or Aramaic, or Persian, or Arabic, as some overpowering and unconscious impulse of the moment might direct... and among these strange sounds... there were some which none could interpret, which rang on the air like the voice of barbarous languages, and which ... conveyed no definite significance beyond the fact that they were reverberations of one and the same ecstasy.\" The writer seems to suggest that when any real language was spoken it was one more or less known previously by the speaker, and that in other cases it was no language at all, only thrilling emotional sounds. Renan's view of the day of Pentecost is a carious specimen of rationalistic interpretation. \"One day when the brethren were come together there was a tempest. A violent wind burst open the windows, and the sky was one sheet of fire. In that climate tempests are often accompanied by an extraordinary amount of electric light. The atmosphere is on all sides furrowed with jets of flame. On this occasion, whether the electric fluid actually passed through the room, or whether the faces of all present were suddenly lit up by an extremely bright flash of lightning, all were convinced that the Holy Spirit had entered their assembly, and had sat upon the head of each in the shape of a tongue of fire... In these moments of ecstasy, the disciple possessed by the Spirit uttered sounds 'inarticulate and incoherent, which the hearers fancied were the words of a strange language, and in their simplicity tried to interpret They listened eagerly to the medley of sounds, and explained them by their own extemporaneous thoughts. Each of them had recourse to his own native patois to supply some meaning to the unintelligible accents, and generally succeeded in affixing to them the thoughts that were uppermost in his own mind\" ('Les Apotres,' pp. 66-68). Elsewhere (pp. 64, 65) he suggests that the whole conception of speaking with tongues arose from the anticipation on the part of the apostles that great difficulty would arise in propagating the gospel from the impossibility of learning to speak the necessary languages. The solution with some was that, under the ecstasy caused by the Holy Spirit, the hearers would be able to translate what they heard into their own tongue; others rather thought that by the same power the apostles would be able to speak any dialect they pleased at the moment. Hence the conception of the day of Pentecost as described by St. Luke! Meyer, again, fully admits, as \"beyond all doubt,\" that St. Luke intended to narrate that the persons possessed by the Spirit spoke in foreign languages previously unknown by them; but adds that \"the sudden communication of a facility of speaking foreign languages is neither logically possible nor psychologically and morally conceivable\" (a pretty bold assertion); and therefore he sets down St. Luke's account of what occurred as \"a later legendary formation,\" based upon the existing γλωσσολαλία. Zeller, traveling a little further on the same road, comes to the conclusion that \"the narrative before us is not based on any definite fact\" (p. 205). Leaving, however, these fanciful varieties of incredulous criticism, and interpreting the statements of this chapter by the later spiritual gifts as seen in the Church of Corinth, we conclude that the\" tongues\" were sometimes \"tongues of men,\" foreign languages unknown to the speakers, and of course unintelligible to the hearers unless any were present, as was the case on the day of Pentecost, who knew the language; and sometimes languages not of earth but of heaven, \"tongues of angels.\" But there is no evidence whatever of their being mere gibberish as distinct from language, or being language coined at the moment by the Holy Ghost. All that St. Paul says to the Corinthians is fully applicable to any language spoken when there were none present who understood it. The significance of the miracle seems to be that it points to the time when all shall be one in Christ, and shall all speak and understand the same speech; and not only all men, but men and angels, \"the whole family in heaven and earth,\" \"things in the heavens and things upon the earth\" all gathered together in one in Christ. It may also not improbably have been used occasionally, as it was on the day of Pentecost, to convey doctrine, knowledge, or exhortation, to foreign people; but there is no distinct evidence that this was the case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Now for and, A.V. ; from for out of, A.V.

This sound. The question still remains whether the sound (φωνή) refers to the sound (ἤχος) of the rushing mighty wind mentioned in ver. 2, or to the voices of those who spake with tongues. If the last, we should rather have expected sounds or voices in the plural; and it is further in favor of the former that μενῆς τῆς φωνῆς ταύτης seems to take up the ἐγένετο ἤχος of ver. 2. The word φωνή is applied to πνεῦμα in John 3:8. Nor is it likely, at first sight, that the disciples in the house where they were sitting should have spoken loud enough to attract the notice of people outside. Whereas the sound of a rushing mighty wind, sufficient (as in Acts 3:31) to shake the house, would naturally he heard by passers-by. On the other hand, however, φωνή seems to point decisively to the human voice (see its use, 1 Corinthians 14:7-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Saying for saying one to another, A.V. and T.R.

These would be the Israelites of the first dispersion, the descendants of those of the ten tribes who were deported by the Assyrians, and of whom the Afghans are perhaps a remnant, and of the first Babylonian captivity. Mesopotamia and Babylon were at this time in possession of the Parthians. Babylon was a great Jewish colony, the seat of \"the princes of the Captivity,\" and of one of the great rabbinical schools. Judaea. The mention of Judaea here is very odd, and can scarcely be right, both from its situation between Mesopotamia and Cappadocia, and because Jews (Judaeans) are mentioned again in ver. 10 (where, however, see note). India, which seems to have been in Chrysostom's Codex ('Hem.'4, end of [3]), Idumaea, Bithynia, and Armenia, have all been suggested as conjectural emendations. One might have expected Galatia, with its different Celtic dialect, and which goes with Pontus, Cappadocia, and Asia in 1 Peter 1:1; a passage, by the way, which shows that there were many Jews in those provinces: Aquila, too, was a Jew from Pontus (Acts 18:2).

See Acts 20:16, 18; Revelation 1:4, etc.). Egypt, etc. These represent the third great dispersion, that effected by Ptolemy Lagus. Some of this part of the dispersion are mentioned as very hostile to Stephen (Acts 6:9). \"Two-fifths of the population of Alexandria were Jews.\" \"Jews formed one quarter of the population of Cyrene\" ('Speaker's Commentary.') See Matthew 27:32 and Acts 13:1). And sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes. The copula and couples the οἱ ἐπιδημοῦντες Ῥωμαῖοι with the οἱ κατοικοῦντες τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν, etc., of ver. 9. It is literally, those of us who are Roman sojourners at Jerusalem, whether Jews by race or proselytes. They were equally Roman sojourners, whether they were Jews whose home was at Rome or whether they were proselytes; and it is an interesting fact that there were such proselytes in the great capital of the heathen world. Sojourners, as in Acts 17:21, the strangers sojourning at Athens. Many good commentators - Alford, Meyer, Lechler (in Lange, 'Bibel Works'), etc. - take the words \"Jews and proselytes\" as applying to the whole preceding list, not to the Roman sojourners only; but in that case one would not expect Cretans and Arabians to follow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Cretans for Cretes, A.V. ; speaking for speak, A.V.; mighty for wonderful, A.V.

New wine; more literally, sweet wine. These mockers, men incapable of serious and devout appreciation of the work of the Holy Spirit, attributed the tension of feeling which they saw, and the unintelligible words which they heard, to the effect of wine. So Festus said,\" Paul, thou art mad.\" So the unbelieving Jews of Pontus and Asia thought it strange that the Christians should live holily, and spake evil of them in consequence (1 Peter 4:4, 14). So Ishmael mocked Isaac (Genesis 21:9); and so in all times \"they that are born after the flesh do persecute them that are born after the Spirit\" (Galatians 4:29).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-16. - Spake forth for said, A.V.; give ear unto for hearken to, A.V.; hath been spoken for was spoken, A.V. But Peter, etc. Peter stands up before the eleven as their primate, foremost in the authority of action as in precedence of place; and the apostles stand up before the multitude of believers, as those to whom Christ committed the government of his Church (see Acts 1:15). Spake forth (ἀπεφθέγξατο, the same word as in ver. 4, \"utterance \"); implying the utterance of a loud and grave oration. In 1 Chronicles 26. it is the phrase of the LXX. for those who prophesied with harps. From it is derived the word apophthegm, \"a remarkable saying\" (Johnson's Dictionary). Ye that dwell at Jerusalem; the same as those described in ver. 5. They were foreign Jews who, either for the feast or for other causes, had taken up their abode at Jerusalem, and are distinguished from the men of Judea, the Jews who were natives of Judaea. Give ear (ἐνωτίζεσθε); found only here in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX. as the rendering of the Hebrew הֶאֶזִין (Genesis 4:23; Job 33:1; Isaiah 1:2). It is not classical Greek, and seems to have been coined by the LXX., as the equivalent of the above-named Hebrew word. It seems to be a rhetorical phrase. The thing to be known unto them was that they saw the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy in what had happened; for it was quite a mistake to attribute it to drunkenness. By the prophet (διὰ, not ὑπὸ); spoken by God through the prophet. The full phrase occurs in Matthew 1:22; Matthew 2:5, 15.

This does not agree with either the Hebrew or the LXX. in the existing texts, where we read merely afterwards (אַהְרֵי כֵן μετὰ ταῦτα The phrase, \"in the last days,\" which occurs in Isaiah 2:2 and elsewhere, denotes the days of Messiah. St. Peter is perhaps expounding the passage as relating to the days of Messiah; or בְ אַחְֲרִית הַיָמִים may have been another reading. Saith God is no part of Joel's prophecy, but Peter's words. Your young men shall see visions, etc. The order of this and the following clause is inverted.

Ye men of Israel. This title includes both the Jews of Judaea and all those of the dispersion, to whatever tribe they belonged. Approved of God. Observe the distinct reference to the miracles of Christ, as the proofs that he came from God, the authenticating evidences of his Divine mission. So St. Peter again, in his address to Cornelius, declares how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (Acts 10:38). The miracles of the gospel are, and were intended to be, a demonstration of the truth of Christianity, and it is at their peril that Christians allow themselves to give up this argument at the bidding of the skeptic. Mighty works and wonders and signs. Δυναμεῖς are powers, acts of healing and such like, done by the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit (see the above reference to Acts 10:38); τέρατα are wonders or portents, such as are spoken of by the Prophet Joel, \"wonders in heaven above,\" the darkening of the sun, the discoloration or the moon, or any ether wonder considered only with reference to its portentous character; σημεῖα are signs, not necessarily miraculous, but things which are proofs, either by their miraculous character or from the time or mode of their occurrence, of the truth of the things spoken. \"Miracles, wonders, and signs\" occur together in 2 Corinthians 12:12.

Which God did by him. So we read Hebrews 1:2, \"Through [or 'by'] whom also he made the worlds.\" And so our Lord said of himself, \"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;\" and \"The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do\" (John 5:17, 19; comp. Matthew 28:18). On the other hand, our Lord often speaks of his own power, as John 2:19; John 10:18 (comp. John 2:11). As Mediator, Christ did all things by his Father's appointment, and for his Father's glory, Even as ye yours, elves know. Mark the confidence with which Peter appeals to their personal knowledge of the miracles of Christ. This was a fitting preparation for the announcement of that mighty power, wonder, and sign which he was now about to proclaim to them - the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHim, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Delivered up for delivered, A.V.; by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay for have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain, A.V. and T.R. The determinate counsel. God's counsel, that Christ should suffer for sins, was not a vague, indistinct purpose, leaving much to accident and the fluctuating will of man; it was determinate and defined in respect of time and manner and the instruments used for carrying it out. Foreknowledge is coupled with counsel or will, perhaps in order to show us that the counsel or will of God, as far as it comprehends the action of free agents, is indissolubly connected with his foreknowledge, and does not involve any force put upon the will of man. (Compare, with Chrysostom, the saying of Joseph to his brethren, \"Be not angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life\" (Genesis 45:5); also Judges 14:4; 1 Kings 12:15, etc. Delivered up (ἔκδοτον, only found here) is by many understood of the action of Judas in betraying Jesus into the hands of his enemies (John 19:11) - ἔκδοτον being taken as equivalent to what πρόδοτον would mean if it were in use. But it may with equal propriety be applied to the action of the chief priests and elders in delivering Jesus to Pontius Pilate (Matthew 27:2)to be crucified (Matthew 27:26). Our Lord himself alludes to Pilate's power as circumscribed by the will of God (John 19:11, ὁ παραδιδούς μέ σοι: comp. Matthew 26:45).

St. Luke follows the LXX., who render the מָוֶת or חֶבְלֵי of Psalm 18:5, 6; Psalm 116:3, by ὠδῖνες θανάτου, as if the Hebrew word were חֵבֶל, the pains or pangs of a woman in childbirth, whereas it really is חֶבֶל, a cord, as it is rendered in the margin of Psalm 18:5, meaning the snare of the fowler. The variation is very similar to that of the \"fruit of our lips\" in Hebrews 13:15, compared with the \"calves of our lips\" of Hosea 14:2. It is manifest that \"loosed\" applies better to cords than to pangs. It was not possible. Why, not possible?NEWLINENEWLINE1. Because of the union of the Godhead and manhood in the one Person of Christ.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Because of God's character, which makes it impossible that one who trusts in him should be forsaken, or that God's Holy One should see corruption.NEWLINENEWLINE3. Because the Scripture, which cannot be broken, declared the resurrection of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Saith for speaketh, A.V.; he held for foresaw, A.V. The sixteenth psalm is ascribed to David in the title prefixed to it in the Hebrew and the LXX. Without pronouncing the titles to be infallible, we must confess that they carry great weight with them in the absence of any strong internal evidence against them. Meyer speaks of the psalm as \"certainly later than David,\" and Ewald and others ascribe it to the time of the Captivity; but Hitzig thinks the internal evidence is in favor of its belonging to the time before David ascended the throne ('Speaker's Commentary'). We may safely rest on the authority of St. Peter here and St. Paul (Acts 13:35, 36), and be satisfied that it is really David's. The manner in which it is quoted by the two apostles is also very strong evidence that by the Jews of that day it was generally admitted to be a Messianic psalm. The following quotation is verbatim from the LXX.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - My heart was glad for did my heart rejoice, A.V.; rejoiced for was glad, A.V.; my flesh also for also my flesh, A.V.; dwell for rest, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Hades for hell, A.V.; give thy Holy One for suffer thine Holy One, A.V., surely not so good a rendering. Hades. The \"hell\" of the A.V. is the exact English representative of ᾅδης. The article in the Creed, \"He descended into hell,\" is based upon this text especially, the other two alleged in support of it (Ephesians 4:9; 1 Peter 3:18, 19) being less conclusive (see Pearson on the Creed, art. 5.). It is a pity to lose the word \"hell\" in its true meaning. Corruption; Greek διαφθρόραν, Hebrew שַׁחַת. The Hebrew word always means a pit (from שׁוּחַ); but the LXX. here render it διαφθορά, as if from שָׁחַת (in Pihel, to destroy, waste; in Hophal and Niphal, to be corrupted, spoilt, to rot). In the A.V. it is rendered corruption, here and in Job 17:14, where it answers to \"the worms,\" in the parallel clause. It is very probable that the LXX. are right. Nothing is more common than for Hebrew verbs to take the meaning of verbs with similar radicals. Holy One. So the LXX. and the Keri of the Hebrew text. But the Cethib has Holy Ones in the plural. It is obvious that the singular, Holy One, agrees far better with the singulars which precede and follow it - my heart, my glory, my flesh, my soul, thou wilt show me - than the plural, which is entirely out of place. The two clauses taken together show the full liberation of Christ from the dominion of death - that of his human soul from bell, and that of his body from the grave before it saw corruption (comp. Acts 13:34-37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Madest for hast made, A.V.; unto for to, A.V.; gladness for joy, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMen and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Brethren for men and brethren, A.V.; I may say unto you freely for let me freely speak unto you, A.V.; both died and was buried for is both dead and buried, A.V.; tomb for sepulcher, A.V. Brethren; literally, men who are my brethren. Observe how gentle and conciliatory the apostle's language is; how exactly in accordance with his own precept (1 Peter 3:8, 9), \"Not rendering railing for railing,\" etc. In addressing them as brethren, he silently claims the good will and fairness due to one who was a brother in blood and in the faith of the God of Israel. The patriarch David. The term patriarch is elsewhere in Scripture applied only to Abraham and the twelve sons of Jacob (Hebrews 7:4; Acts 7:8, 9). It is a title of dignity, signifying the head of a house. It seems to be here applied to David, because he is spoken of as head of the family from which Christ sprang. Abraham was the head of the whole Hebrew race: \"Abraham our father.\" The twelve patriarchs were the heads of their respective tribes. The LXX. use the word πατριάρχης as the rendering of רֹאושׁ הָאָבות \"chief of the fathers' houses\" (1 Chronicles 24:31; 2 Chronicles 19:8; 2 Chronicles 26:12); which they elsewhere render by ἄρχων, or ἀρχὴ πατριᾶς (Exodus 6:25, etc.). In common parlance, the term is also applied to those chief persons who lived before the time of Moses, and have their record in his books. His tomb is with us, etc. Josephus speaks of David's tomb (calling it, as St. Peter here does, his μνῆμα) as consisting of several chambers, and relates how one of these chambers was opened by the high priest Hyrcanus, who took from it three thousand talents of gold to give to Antiochus Pins, who was at that time laying siege to Jerusalem. He adds that another chamber was opened later by King Herod, who abstracted a great quantity of golden ornaments from it; but that neither of them penetrated to the vaults where the bodies of David and Solomon were deposited, because the entrance to them was so carefully concealed. He further mentions that Herod, having been terrified by the bursting out of flames, which stopped his further progress, built a most costly marble monument at the entrance of the tomb ('Jud. Ant.,' 7. 15:3; 13. 8:4; 16. 7:1). For the sense, supply \"and therefore he could not be speaking of himself.\" The explanation follows that he was a prophet, etc.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Being therefore for therefore being, A.V.; that of the fruit of his loins he would set one upon for that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on, A.V. and T.R. Had sworn, etc. The first record of God's promise to David is in 2 Samuel 7:11-16: \"The Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house. And... I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and will establish his kingdom.... Thy throne shall be established forever;\" and in ver. 28, David speaks of it as God's promise: \"Thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant.\" But there is no mention there of an oath. But in Psalm 89, great stress is laid upon God having sworn to David: \"I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations\" (vers. 3, 4); and again, ver. 35, \"Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David\" 1 Samuel 7 and Psalm 89, should be read through carefully (comp. also Isaiah 4:3; Acts 13:23). (For the phrase, \"I have sworn by my holiness,\" see Amos 4:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Foreseeing this for seeing this before, A.V.; neither was he left in Hades for his soul was not left in hell, A.V. and T.R.; nor did his flesh for neither his flesh did, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Did God raise up for hath God raised up, A.V.

By the right hand, etc. Some render it,\" Being exalted to the right hand,\" etc.; or, \"Being at the right hand of God exalted.\" It is very questionable whether the Greek will bear the first rendering; and it would have been more natural to express the second by εἰς τὴν δεξιάν. It is best, therefore, to take it as the A.V. and the R.V. do. Tile phrase is equivalent to that in Psalm 98:1, \"His right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory,\" and numerous other passages. The promise of the Holy Ghost (see Acts 1:4, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Ascended not for is not ascended, A.V. For David, etc. The ascension of Christ is inferred from the previous prophecy, \"Thou wilt show me the path of life,\" etc.; and is there distinctly proved from Psalm 110:1, which Peter (remembering, probably, our Lord's application of it as recorded in Matthew 22:42-45, which he had doubtless heard) shows could not apply to David himself, but only to David's Lord.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUntil I make thy foes thy footstool.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Till for until, A.V.; thine enemies for thy foes, A.V. ; the footstool of thy feet for thy footstool, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Let all the house of Israel therefore for therefore let all the house of Israel, A.V. ; him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified for that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ, A.V., a change very much for the worse, inasmuch as the R.V. is not an English phrase, and adds nothing to the sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The rest for to the rest, A.V.; brethren for men and brethren, A.V. Pricked in their heart (κατενύγησαν). The LXX. rendering of Psalm 109:16 (15, Prayer-book), \"broken,\" or \"vexed at the heart.\" Genesis 34:7 it is rendered \"grieved.\" Unto Peter and the rest of the apostles. It is important to note from the beginning the relative position of Peter and the other apostles; a certain primacy and precedence, both in place and in action, he has undoubtedly. He is always named first, and he acts first, in preaching both to Jews and Gentiles. The keys are in his hands, and the door is first opened as he turns the lock. But it is equally clear that he is but one of the apostles; he is not set over them, but acts with them; he is not their superior, but their fellow; they are not eclipsed by his presence, but only animated by his example; inquirers after salvation do not ask at his mouth only, but of the whole college of the apostles. Brethren (see ver. 29). The Jews and Israelites now hold out the right hand of brotherhood to those whom before they reviled (ver. 13). What shall we do? It is a sign of the working of God's Spirit in the heart, renewing it to repentance, when men feel the need of changing their old course of thought and action, and inquire anxiously what they must do to inherit eternal life (comp. Mark 10:17; Acts 9:6; Acts 16:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - And for then, A.V.; said (in italics) for said, A.V. and T.R.; repent ye for repent, A.V.; unto for for, A.V.; your sins for sins, A.V. Repent, etc. We have in this short verse the summary of Christian doctrine as regards man and God. Repentance and faith on the part of man; forgiveness of sins, or justification, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, or sanctification, on the part of God. And both these are expressed in the sacrament of baptism, which as it were ties the act of man to the promise of God. For the sacrament expresses man's faith and repentance on one side, and God's forgiveness and gift on the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - To you is the promise for the promise is unto you, A.V.; shall call unto him for shall call. To you is the promise (see Acts 1:4; Acts 2:33). There is also a reference to the prophecy in Joel, quoted in vers. 17-21. To all that are afar off; i.e. the Gentiles, as appears clearly from Ephesians 2:17, where the same phrase is applied to the Ephesian Christians, and the Jewish Christians are spoken of as \"those that were nigh.\" The fulfilment to the Gentiles is specially recorded (Acts 10:45; Acts 11:15, 18, etc.). Shall call unto him (comp. Romans 1:6; Romans 8:28, 30; Romans 9:24; 1 Corinthians 1:2; Galatians 1:6 (etc.), which confirm the application of the \"afar off\" to the Gentiles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - He testified, and exhorted for did he testify and exhort, A.V.; crooked for untoward, A.V. Save yourselves, etc. The idea is that the crooked generation which denied and crucified the Lord is hurrying on to their destruction. Those who would not perish with them must come out from amongst them and be separate from them (2 Corinthians 6:19), and seek safely in the ark of Christ's Church (1 Peter 3:21), as Noah did in the ark, and as Lot did in Zoar. So the jailer at Philippi, seeking to be saved, was baptized straightway (Acts 16:30-33). This was the drift and end of all St. Peter's exhortations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - They then for then they, A.V.; received for gladly received, A.V. and T.R.; there were added unto them in that day for the same day there were added unto them, A.V. Gladly received. The best manuscripts omit ἀσμενως, which, indeed, is superfluous, as the word ἀποδέχομαι contains in itself the idea of a kind reception - a welcome (Luke 8:40; Acts 15:4; Acts 24:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Teaching for doctrine, A.V.; in the breaking for and in breaking, A.V. and T.R.; the prayers for in prayer, A.V. And fellowship; better, as in the margin, in fellowship; not meaning the apostles' fellowship, but the fellowship of the Church - that common life of close brotherhood in which all that they did was done in common, and all that they possessed was possessed in common, so that there seemed to be but one heart and one mind amongst them all. Breaking of bread; in the Holy Eucharist (see Matthew 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19; Luke 24:30; 1 Corinthians 11:24; 1 Corinthians 10:16; Acts 20:7). The prayers; the common prayers of the Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Fear came, etc. This seems to be spoken of the awe which fell upon the whole people, and restrained them from interfering with the disciples. Just as at the first settlement of Israel in the land of Canaan God laid the fear of them and the dread of them upon all the hind (Deuteronomy 11:25), so now the fear engendered by the events on the day of Pentecost, by the signs and wonders which followed and by the wonderful unity and holiness of the newborn Church, so wrought upon every soul at Jerusalem that all enmity was paralyzed, and the disciples had time to multiply and to consolidate and establish themselves before the storm of persecution fell upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all that believed were together, and had all things common;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - Were together (ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό; see Acts 1:15, note, and above, ver. 42). Had all things common. Just as the Transfiguration gave a passing glimpse of the state of glory, so here we have a specimen of what Christian love and unity in its perfection, and unchecked by contact with the world without, would, and perhaps some day will, produce. But even at Jerusalem this bright vision of a paradise on earth was soon troubled by the earthly dissensions recorded in Acts 6; and the Christian community received a timely lesson that things good in themselves are not always practicable in an evil world, where sluggish virtues require the stimulants of bodily wants to draw them out and strengthen them, and where hypocrisy often claims the kindly offices which are due only to disciples indeed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - They sold for sold, A.V.; all for all men, A.V. ; according as any for as every, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - Day by day continuing steadfastly for they continuing daily, A.V.; at home for from house to house, A.V.; they did take their food for did eat their meat, A.V. In the temple. It is very remarkable that at this early age of the Church's existence Christians did not deem themselves separated from their Jewish brethren, or from the Old Testament institutions. Christianity was but Judaism perfected; the gospel the full blossoming of the Law. The first Christian Jews, therefore, did not conceive of themselves as quitting the religion of their fathers, but rather hoped that their whole nation would in a short time acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ. Christian institutions, therefore - the prayers, the breaking of bread, the prophesyings and speaking with tongues, and the apostolic teachings - were supplemental to the temple service, not antagonistic to it; and the church took the place rather of the synagogue than of the temple (see 'Dict. of Bible:' \"Synagogue\"). At home. This version hardly represents the true idea of the original; κατ οϊκον represents the private Christian place of meeting, as contrasted with the temple. The meaning is not that every disciple broke bread in his own house, but that they broke bread at the house where the Christian assemblies were held, whether one or more. We have already seen the Church gathered together \"in an upper room\" (Acts 1:13), in \"one place,\" in \"a house\" (Acts 2:1, 2), and \"together\" (ver. 44; see too Acts 4:31); and we know that as the synagogue was called בֵּית תְפִּלָּה, house of prayer, or בֵּית הַכְּנֶסֶת, the house of assemblage, so the Christian place of meeting was called ὁ Κυριακὸς οῖκος; the Lord's house, whence the word \"church.\" (For breaking bread, see above, ver. 42.) They did take their food. The link of connection is the ἀγάπη or love-feast, which formed an important part of the κοινωνία, or common life, of the early Christians. The whole description is a beautiful picture of Christian unity, piety, love, and joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs2:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPraising God, and having favour with all the people.

Added to them day by day. The R.T. has instead of τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ the words ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, which in Acts 2:1 are properly rendered \"in one place,\" but do not seem to be rendered at all in the R.V. of this verse. In fact, they have no sense unless you construe them with τοὺς σωζομένους, \"those who escaped to the same place,\" i.e. to the Church. But it seems most probable that the words ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό do really belong to Acts 3:1, where they are found in the T.R. If τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ does not properly belong to the text (it is wanting in A, B, C, א, and many versions), then προσετίθει must be taken absolutely, as προσετέθησαν is in ver. 41, the Church, or the disciples, being understood. Those that were being saved. The exhortation in ver. 40 was \"Save yourselves from this crooked generation.\" Those who were added to the Church were those who complied with the exhortation, and escaped from complicity with their unbelieving countrymen. They were the remnant that escaped. (See the use of οἱ σωζόμενοι in the LXX. (2 Chronicles 20:25, etc.), and see Mark 16:16.)NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Were going up for went up together, A.V. and T.R. Peter and John. The close friendship of these two apostles is remarkable. The origin of it appears to have been their partnership in the fishing-boats in which they pursued their trade as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. For St. Luke tells us that the sons of Zebedee were \"partners with Simon,\" and helped him to take the miraculous draught of fishes (Luke 5:10). We find the two sons of Zebedee associated with Peter in the inner circle of the Lord's apostles, at the Transfiguration, at the raising of Jairus's daughter, and at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (see also Mark 13:3). But the yet closer friendship of Peter and John first appears in their going together to the palace of Caiaphas on the night of the betrayal (John 18:15), and then in the memorable visit to the holy sepulcher on the morning of the Resurrection (John 20:2-4), and yet again in John 21:7, 20, 21. It is in strict and natural sequence to these indications in the Gospel that, on opening the first chapters of the Acts, we find Peter and John constantly acting together in the very van of the Christian army (see Acts 3:1, 3, 11; Acts 4:13, 19; Acts 8:14, 25). The hour of prayer; called in Luke 1:10, \"the hour of incense,\" that is, the hour of the evening sacrifice, when the people stood outside in prayer, while the priest within offered the sacrifice and burnt the incense (see Acts 2:46, note). Hence the comparison in Psalm 141:2, \"Let my prayer be set before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - That was lame for lame, A.V.; door for gate, A.V. Door. If any distinction is intended between the θύρα here and the πύλη of ver. 10 (which is not certain, as θύρα is often used for a gate), we must understand θύρα of the double doors of the gate described by Josephus. Perhaps the lame man leant against one of the open doors. Which is called Beautiful. It is not certain what gate this was. In the 'Dictionary of the Bible' it is described as \"the great eastern gate leading from the court of the women to the upper court,\" following apparently Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:3. But it is impossible to reconcile Josephus's two accounts - that in the 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. and that in 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 11. In the former he says distinctly that there were ten gates - four on the north, four on the south, and two on the east. In the latter he says there were three gates on the north, three on the south, and one on the east. In the former he says that fifteen steps led up from the women's enclosure to the great gate, exactly opposite the gate of the temple itself (ἄντικρυ τῆς τοῦ ναοῦ πυλῆς); in the latter he says very distinctly that women were allowed to enter through the great gate on the east. With such discrepancies in the description of the only eye-witness whose evidence has been preserved, it is impossible to speak with certainly. But it seems probable that there were two gates on the east - one the beautiful and costly gate of Corinthian brass, elaborately described by Josephus, through which the women did pass; the other the greater gate, just opposite to and above the beautiful gate (ἡ ὑπὲρ τὴν Κορινθίαν), leading from the court of the women to the inner court; and that Josephus has confounded one with the other in his descriptions. Anyhow, the beautiful gate was probably on the east. Its correct name is said to be the gate of Nicanor. The temple. It must be remembered that the whole platform, including the porches, and the courts of the Gentiles and of the women, and the outer court and the court of the priests, was called τὸ ἱερόν; the actual house was called ὁ ναός; that part of the ἱερόν to which only Israelites were admitted, was called τὸ ἅγιον. Josephus also divides the precincts into the first, second, and third ἱερόν. The description of this lame man laid at the gate of the temple to ask alms is very similar to that in Luke 16:20 of Lazarus laid at the rich man's gate; only that the word for laid is in St. Luke ἐπέβλητο, and here is ἐτίθουν.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - To receive an alms for an alms, A.V. and T.R.

What Peter meant by \"in the Name,\" he clearly explains in vers. 12 and 16, where he shows that they did not work the miracle by their own power or godliness, but that the lame man was healed by the Name of Jesus, in which he believed. So our Lord said of himself, \"I am come in my Father's Name\" (John 5:43; comp. John 10:25) Observe the full designation of our Lord as \"Jesus Christ of Nazareth\" (τοῦ Ναζωραίου), as in Acts 4:10, and comp. Matthew 11:23. The faith which was the condition of the healing (ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει, ver. 16) embraced the humiliation and cross of the Christ (as expressed in the word the Nazarene) as well as his power and glory.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Raised for lifted, A.V.; his ankle-bones for ancle bones, A.V.

Wonder and amazement (θάμβος); any very strong emotion of awe, or admiration, or astonishment. It occurs elsewhere only in Luke 4:36, where it describes the awe and amazement which came upon those who witnessed the casting out of the unclean spirit from the man in the synagogue at Capernaum. The verb θαμβέω occurs in Acts 9:6 in the T.R., and is rendered \"astonished\" in the A.V., but is omitted in the text of the R.V.; elsewhere only in Mark 1:27; Mark 10:24, 32. Ἕκθαμβος occurs once in ver. 11 of this chapter; and ἐκθαμβέομαι in Mark 9:15; Mark 14:33; Mark 16:5, 6; ἔκστασις, an ecstasy, mostly used of a state of transport, as Acts 10:10; Acts 11:5; Acts 22:17. But in the LXX. (Genesis 27:33), Mark 5:42; Mark 16:8; and Luke 5:26, it is used, as here, for a violent emotion of astonishment and amazement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He for the lame man which was healed, A.V. and T.R. The words of the T.R. are thought to have crept into the text from the portions read in church beginning here, which made it necessary to supply them. Held; by the hand or otherwise; not have to in the spiritual sense. The porch that is called Solomon's. Josephus tells us that King Solomon built up with masonry only the eastern side of the temple enclosure, and that upon the artificial foundation thus formed one στοά, or covered colonnade, was built, the other sides of the temple in Solomon's time being naked and bare of buildings, but that in process of time, and by an enormous expenditure of treasure, the ground was filled up, leveled, and made firm by the masonry of huge walls all round, and then the circuit of buildings was completed. This eastern στοά, or colonnade, was called Solomon's porch (see John 10:23). Greatly wondering; ἔκθαμβοι, (see note on ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - At this man for at this, A.V.; fasten ye your eyes for look ye so earnestly, A.V.; godliness for holiness, A.V.; him for this man, A.V. The him at the end of the verse requires that the man should have been previously mentioned. The A.V. felt this, and so, having taken ἐπὶ τούτῳ as at this, they rendered αὐτόν by this man, as if Peter had supplied the want of the verbal mention by pointing to him. Fasten ye your eyes. (For the use of ἀτενίζειν, see note on ver. 4.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Servant for Son, A.V.; before the face for in the presence, A.V.; had for was, A.V.; release him for let him go, A.V. The God of Abraham, etc. The continuity of the New Testament with the Old Testament stands out remarkably in St. Peter's address. He speaks to the \"men of Israel,\" and he connects the present miracle with all that God had (lone to their fathers in days gone by. He does not seem conscious of any break or transition, or of any change of posture or position. Only a new incident, long since promised by the prophets, has been added. \"tie thrusts himself upon the fathers of old, lest he should appear to be introducing a new doctrine\" (Chrysostom). God... hath glorified his Servant Jesus. Servant is manifestly right (so St. Chrysostom). It is the constant meaning of παῖς in the LXX.; son is always υἱός (see ver. 26; Acts 4:27, 30). In Matthew 12:18 the A.V. has \"servant.\" (For the Old Testament usage, see Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 52:13; Isaiah 53:11). Delivered up; παρεδώκατε, different from the ἔκδοτον of Acts 2:23 (where see note). The word is applied to the action of Judas in delivering up Jesus into the hands of the chief priests (John 19:11), and to the action of Pilate in sending Jesus to execution (Luke 23:25; John 19:16). Here it is spoken of the whole action of the Jews in procuring the death of Jesus. Denied before the face of Pilate. The reference is exact to Luke 23:13-23. To release him. There is a verbal agreement with Luke 23:16, 17, 20.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Holy and righteous One for Holy One and the Just, A.V. ; asked for for desired, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Raised for bath raised, A.V. The Prince of life; a remarkable title here given to our Lord, to bring out the contrast between him whom they preferred and him whom they rejected. Barabbas was a murderer, one who took away human life for his own base ends; the other was the Prince and Author of life, who was come into the world, not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. This title, taken in connection with the preceding declaration, \"God hath glorified his Servant Jesus,\" seems almost to be a reminiscence of our Savior's prayer,\" Father,... glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him\" (John 17:1, 2). Jesus himself in very many places dwells upon his own great prerogative of giving life: \"I am come that they might have life, and.., have it more abundantly\" (John 10:10); \"I am that Bread of life;\" \"I am the living Bread ... if any man cat of this bread, he shall live for ever;\" \"I give... my flesh for the life of the world;\" \"Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life;\" \"They that hear shall live;\" \"As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;\" \"The Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should... have eternal life;\" \"The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\" The word ἀρχηγός applied to Christ is found also in Acts 5:31, and in Hebrews 2:10; Hebrews 12:2, rendered the \"Author or Captain of their salvation,\" \"of our faith.\" Whereof we are witnesses (see Acts 2:22, note). The marginal rendering of whom is equally literal, and may be defended by reference to Acts 1:8; Acts 13:31; but the rendering whereof is in accordance with the more frequent phrases (Acts 5:32; Acts 10:39, etc.). The meaning is practically the same.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - By faith in his Name hath this for his Name through faith in his Name, A.V.: the order of the words is changed from that of the A.V., to bring it into accordance with the order of the Greek, but with a great loss of force in English; behold for see, A.V.; through for by, A.V. Yea, the faith; rather, and the faith. The two propositions are not the same. The first affirms that it is the Name of Jesus which has given him strength, objectively; the second that the faith (subjective) which is through or by him hath given him perfect soundness. There is some obscurity in the exact meaning of ἡ πίστις ἡ δι αὐτοῦ. Some (see Alford, 1:1) compare 1 Peter 1:21, and make God the object of the faith of his witnesses, Peter and John. Others (Meyer) understand that the faith in the Name of Christ was wrought in Peter and John by or through Christ's ministry and resurrection. But it is much more consonant with other passages (Acts 14:9; Acts 16:31, etc.; Matthew 15:28, etc.) to understand the faith to be that of the man who was healed; and then the phrase, \"which is through him,\" will denote naturally that it was through Jesus Christ that the man's faith brought him into contact, so to speak, with God who healed him. In the same spirit we read that the lame man \"praised God\" (vers. 8, 9) for the cure effected through the Name of Jesus Christ; and Peter says (ver. 15), \"Whom God raised from the dead.\" The interpretation of the phrase ἡ δι αὐτοῦ depends upon whether we supply an active or a passive word. The faith which acts, or works, or moves through him is one way of understanding it; the faith which is wrought or produced through him is the other. The first is preferable. This perfect soundness; pointing to what they saw with their own eyes while the man was leaping and dancing before them (ὁλοκληρία, perfect soundness, used only here in the New Testament; it is a medical term).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - In for through, A.V. I wot that in ignorance, etc. Mark the inimitable skill and tenderness with which he who had just wounded by his sharp rebuke now binds up the wound. All sternness and uncompromising severity before, he is all gentleness and indulgence now. They were only \"men of Israel\" in ver. 12, now they are \"brethren.\" He has an excuse for their grievous sin. They did it in ignorance (comp. Luke 23:33; 1 Timothy 1:13). Only let them see their error and repent of what they had done, and their forgiveness was sure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - The things for those things, A.V.; foreshowed or before had showed, A.V.; the prophets for his prophets, A.V. and T.R.; his Christ for Christ, A.V. and T.R.; he thus fulfilled for he hath so fulfilled, A.V. He even excuses their ignorance by showing how the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God was brought about through it (comp. Gem 45:5, and see above, Acts 1:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRepent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Turn again for be converted, A.V., with no difference in sense; that so there may come seasons of refreshing for when the times of refreshing shall come, A.V. Turn again. The turning to God is the consequence of the change of mind (μετάνοια). That so there may come; rightly for the A.V. \"when,\" etc., which the Greek cannot mean. What Peter conceives is that if Israel turns to God at once in the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, then there will come at once those times of refreshing, those blessed days of righteousness, and peace, and rest, and universal joy, which are the characteristics of Christ's kingdom as foretold by the prophets. Those days are delayed by the unbelief of Israel. Seasons of refreshing. The A.V.\" times of refreshing\" is manifestly right, though there is no article in the Greek. \"Seasons of refreshing\" seems very vague and vapid (see Alford, 1:1, who very appropriately and conclusively cites the phrase καιροὶ ἐθνών, \"the times of the Gentiles\"(Luke 21:24). Meyer also compares the παράκλησιν τοῦ Ἰσραήλ of Luke 2:25, and so in ver. 21, χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως is rendered \"the times of restoration.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And that he may send the Christ... even Jesus for and he shall send Jesus Christ, A.V.; who hath been appointed (προκεχειρισμένον, Acts 22:14; Acts 26:16) for you for (προκεκηρυγμένον) which before was preached unto you, A.V. and T.R. Who hath been appointed, etc. Jesus is already designated and appointed and made (Acts 2:36) both Lord and Christ, but his glorious presence with his Church is deferred for a time, during which he is in heaven (ver. 21). Tim R.V. is surely very infelicitous here, as if there were several Christs, one of whom was appointed for Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Restoration for restitution, A.V.; whereof for which, A.V.; spake for hath spoken, A.V.; his for all his, A.V. and T.R. Whom the heaven must receive. This is clearly right, not as some render it, who must occupy heaven. The aorist δέξασθαι seems to point to the moment when, at the Ascension, he was carried up into heaven (Luke 24:51). The restoration of all things (ἀποκαταστάσεως πάντων). This must be the same operation as our Lord speaks of in Matthew 17:11: \"Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things (ἀποκαταστήσει πάντα) ;\" and from the words of Malachi (Malachi 4:5, 6) it would seem to be a moral or spiritual restoration preparatory to the coming of the Lord. If so, the time of restoration is not exactly synchronous with the times of refreshing, but preparatory to them; preparatory, too, to that restoration of the kingdom to Israel of which the apostles spake to the Lord (Acts 1:6). Probably, however, St. Peter includes in his view the immediately following times of\" the presence of the Lord,\" just as in St. Mark (Mark 1:1) the preparatory mission of John the Baptist is included in the phrase, \"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\" Whereof God spake. The antecedent to \"whereof\" is \"the times\" (ver. 24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Moses indeed said for Moses truly said unto the fathers, A.V. and T.R.; the Lord God for the Lord your God, A.V. and T.R.; from among for of, A.V.; to him shall ye hearken for him shall ye hear, A V. ; speak for say, A.V. Moses indeed said. Peter now verifies his assertion about the prophets in the previous verse by quoting from Moses, and referring to Samuel and those that came after. A prophet, etc. The quotation is from Deuteronomy 18:15-18. That this was understood by the Jews to relate to some one great prophet who had not yet come, appears from the question \"Art thou that prophet?\" (John 1:21), and from the saying of the Jews after the miracle of the loaves and fishes, \"This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world\" (John 6:14; John 7:40). St. Peter here teaches that that prophet was none other than Christ himself, who was like unto Moses in the fullness of the revelation given unto him, in his being a Mediator between God and the people, in being the Author of a new law - the law of faith and love, in building a new tabernacle for God to inhabit, even the Church in which he will dwell for ever and ever (see Hebrews 1:1, 2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Shall be for come to pass, A.V.; shall not hearken to for will not hear, A.V.; utterly destroyed for destroyed, A.V. Utterly destroyed. The Greek ἐξολοθρεύω οξξυρσ frequently in the LXX. for the Hebrew phrase,\" cut off from his people\" (Genesis 17:14); but in Deuteronomy 18:19, the phrase is quite different, \"I will require it of him.\" St. Peter here gives the sense, not the ipsissima verba, and thereby marks the extreme gravity of the sin of unbelief (see John 3:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Them that followed for those that follow, A.V.: they also told for have likewise foretold, A.V. From Samuel, etc. Samuel and οἱ καθεξῆς seems to denote what the Jews called \"the former prophets\" - the authors of the historical books. The whole phrase, therefore, comprehends \"all the prophets\" (of whom Samuel and οἱ καθεξῆς were the first), to whose testimony concerning himself our Lord appeals (Luke 24:27, 44).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Sons for children, A.V.; your for our, A.V. and T.R.; families for kindreds, A.V. Ye are the sons of the prophets, meaning that they inherited all the promises made by the prophets to their fathers. Just as in Acts 2:39 he said, \"The promise is unto you and to your children\" (comp. Romans 9:4; Romans 15:8). He thus enforces the solemn obligation of giving heed to what the prophets had said concerning Christ and his kingdom. In thy seed (see Galatians 3:16). This covenant, into which God entered with Abraham, with an oath (Genesis 22:16, 18), and which was a repetition and amplification of the covenant and promise already recorded in Genesis 12:1-3; Genesis 15; Genesis 17:1-8, was made πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας, with a view to, in the direction of, the fathers, so as to include them and their children after them. It was now fulfilled to those whom St. Peter was addressing, as is set forth in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTUnto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Servant for Son Jesus, A.V. and T.R.; your for his, A.V. Unto you first. In virtue of the covenant, the first offer of salvation was made to the Jews (see Acts 1:8; Acts 13:26, 46; Luke 24:47; Romans 2:10, etc.; comp. Matthew 15:24). His Servant (as in ver. 13). As regards the phrase, \"having raised up,\" however natural it is at first sight to understand it of the raising from the dead, the tenses make it impossible to do so. Nor could it be said that God sent Jesus to bless them after his resurrection. We must, therefore, understand ἀναστήσας as to be equivalent to ἐξαγείρας, and to mean \"having appointed,\" set up, raised up (as the English word is used, Luke 1:69; Romans 9:17). In this sense God raised up his Servant by the incarnation, birth, anointing, and mission to be the Savior. To bless you; to fulfill to you the blessing promised to Abraham's seed. In turning away, etc., deliverance from sin being the chief blessing which Christ bestows upon his people (so Acts 5:31, repentance is spoken of as Christ's great gift to Israel). So closed the second great apostolic sermon.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - The captain of the temple. Only here and Acts 5:24, and Luke 22:4, 52 in the plural some have thought that the commander of the Roman garrison of the castle of Antonia is here meant. But as the scene is laid in the court of the temple, this is very improbable. Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20, 6:2) speaks of an officer apparently of the temple, who was called ὁ στρατηγός, and was certainly a Jew by his name Ananus, and being, as Josephus relates farther ('Bell Jud.,' 2, 12:6), the son of the high priest Ananias. He also mentions the captain of the temple ('Bell. Jud.,' 6, 5:3) at the time of the destruction of the temple. There can be little doubt, therefore, that the captain of the temple here spoken of was a priest who had under him the Levitical guard, and whose duty it was to keep order in the temple courts in these turbulent times, lie appears from Acts 5:25, 26, Luke 22:4, 52, and the passages in Josephus, to have been an officer of high rank.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeing grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Sore troubled for grieved, A.V.; because for that, A.V.; proclaimed in Jesus for preached through Jesus, A.V. The preaching the resurrection of the Lord Jesus as the \"First fruits of them that slept,\" would be especially obnoxious to the Sadducees, \"which deny that there is any resurrection\" (Luke 20:27). The Sadducees were at this time in power (see Acts 5:17; and comp. Acts 23:6-8); and we learn from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,'20. 9:1) that the son of this Annas (or Anauus) went over to the sect of the Sadducees, being himself high priest as his father had been.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Ward for hold, A.V.

The harsh persecution of the disciples at Jerusalem at this time when the Sadducees were in power is in exact accordance with Josephus's statement in the passage just referred to, that the Sadducees were more severe and cruel in their administration of justice than any other Jews. Their tenet of no life to come made them look to severe punishments in this life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But for howbeit, A.V.; that for which, A.V.; came to be for was, A.V. The number of the men; strictly, of the males (ἀνδρῶν) (Acts 5:14), but probably used here more loosely of men and women. It is not clear whether the five thousand is exclusive of or includes the three thousand converts at the Feast of Pentecost; but the grammar rather favors, the former, as there is nothing in the word ἀνδρῶν, itself to signify \"disciples,\" or \"believers,\" and therefore it is more naturally referred to those of whom it had just been predicated that, having heard the Word, they believed it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Were gathered together in Jerusalem for at (ver. 6), A.V.; or, as it should rather be rendered, to - some of them probably living in the country. This clause is placed in the A.V. at the end of ver. 6 because, in the T.R., Annas, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander are in the accusative ease, whereas, in the R.T., they are in the nominative case; for which reason the R.V. supplies the words \"was there\" in ver. 6. We see here the different classes which composed the Sanhedrim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Annas the high priest was there for Annas the high priest, a.V. This is the same Annas as is mentioned in Luke 3:2 and John 18:13, and is described as \"father-in-law to Caiaphas.\" He is called by Josephus, Ananus. The succession of the high priests was so irregular, and their tenure of the office so uncertain, in these later years of the Jewish commonwealth, being dependent upon the caprice of the civil rulers who appointed and deposed them at their pleasure, that it does not surprise us to find Annas and Caiaphas high priests at the commencement of John the Baptist's ministry, then Caiaphas at the time of our Lord's passion, and now Annas again. It is possible, however, that Annas may have continued to be president of the Sanhedrim, and be called high priest, even when not actually so. He seems to have lived to old age. He is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20, 60:1) as having had the singular felicity not only of enjoying the high priesthood himself for a great length of time, but of having five sons promoted to the dignity of high priest, viz. Eleazar, Jonathan, Theophilus, Mat-thins, and Ananus (or Annas). Caiaphas (John 18:13). Of John and Alexander nothing further is known, but Farrar conjectures that John may be \"the celebrated Johanan Ben Zakkai, and Alexander perhaps the wealthy brother of Philo\" ('Life of St. Paul,' 1. p. 107). Of the kindred of the high priest; rather, of the high priestly race. The high priests were only taken from certain families; the members of which were called ἀρχιερεῖς, or chief priests, A.V. (Matthew 16:21; Matthew 26:47, etc.), Many of these would naturally be the near relations of the high priest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Inquired for asked, A.V.; in for by, A.V.

The following οῦτος, this man, makes it necessary to supply the definite article, as the A.V. has done.

Jesus Christ of Nazareth (see Acts 3:6, note). Whom ye crucified, whom God raised. With what wonderful conciseness and force are the great doctrines of the gospel condensed into a few words! The human nature, the mediatorial glory, the humiliating but atoning death, the glorious resurrection (a cardinal point in all the apostolic preaching), and the present might of Christ to save his people on earth, are all set out in hail a dozen pregnant words. Even in him. The apostle thus passes from the Name to him whose Name it was. Before you. How could they deny what was actually before their eyes?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He for this, A.V.; the builders for builders, A.V.; was made for is become, A.V. He is the stone. He had just appealed to their own senses; he now adds the witness of their own prophets. These had declared that the stone which was set at naught by the builders should become the chief corner-stone; just as it had come to pass. The quotation is from Psalm 118:22; only St. Luke here substitutes the word ἐξουθενεῖν, to set at naught, for that used by the LXX., ἀποδοκιμάζειν, to refuse, or reject as unfit. The word ἐξουθενεῖν is applied directly to our Saviour in Luke 23:11, and the similar word, ἐξουδενόειν, in Mark 9:11.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And in none other is there salvation for neither is there salvation in any other, A.V.; neither is there any other, etc., for there is none other, A.V.; that is given for given, A.V.; wherein for whereby, A.V. The eighteenth Article of Religion refers directly to this verse as proving that eternal salvation can be obtained only by the Name of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Beheld for saw, A.V.; had perceived for perceived, A.V. The boldness; literally, free or outspokenness (παῥῤησία), and properly used with words signifying to speak (see Acts 2:29; Acts 4:29, 31; Acts 28:31; John 7:13, etc.), and so the verb (παρρησιάζεσθαι) means \"to speak freely and boldly\" (Acts 9:27, 29; Acts 13:46; Acts 14:3; Acts 18:26; Acts 19:8; Acts 26:26; elsewhere in the New Testament only in Ephesians 6:20; 1 Thessalonians 2:2). St. Peter had shown his free-spokenness in so boldly proclaiming the resurrection and mighty power of him whom the rulers he was addressing had crucified. Boldness of speech, when combined with charity and moderation, is a most important grace for a minister of Christ. Unlearned and ignorant men. The term unlearned (ἀγράμματος) means that they had no \"knowledge of Jewish culture\" beyond the Scriptures. Ignorant men (ἰδιῶται) was a technical term for those who had not studied in rabbinic schools. The word hediot occurs frequently in the Talmud (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 106). They took knowledge, etc. Annas and Caiaphas or some of their people, it is likely, had seen them in the high priest's palace (John 18:15-18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Beholding for seeing, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Wrought through them for done by them, A.V.; to all for to all them, A.V. Only here and at ver. 22 and in Luke 23:8 has miracle been retained in the R.V. as the rendering of σημεῖα: everywhere else it is sign.

The subject of that it spread seems to be \"a notable miracle.\" They could not deny that it had taken place, but they could prevent the knowledge of it spreading, by forbidding the apostles to speak of the Name of Jesus in which it had been wrought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Charged for commanded, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Rather for more, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Saw and heard for have seen and heard, A.V.

To their own company (comp. Malachi 3:16). The chief priests (οἱ ἀρχειρεῖς); evidently the same as those who were described as being \"of the kindred of the high priest,\" in ver. 6 (where see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - They, when they heard it, lifted for when they heard that they lifted, A.V.; O Lord, thou that didst make, or as in margin, thou art he that did make, for Lord, thou art God, which hast made, T.R. and A.V.; the heaven and the earth for heaven and earth, A.V. With one accord (ὁμοθυμαδόν) occurs eleven times in the Acts (ten times in the R.T.) and only once elsewhere in the New Testament, viz. in Romans 15:6. O Lord, etc. Either the margin or the A.V. is preferable to the R.V., which gives an unmeaning vocative pendent. The word here used for \"Lord\" is δεσπότης, from which our English word \"despot\" comes. It means \"master, owner,\" in respect of slaves, and \"a lord\" or \"king,\" whose power over his subjects is similar to that of a master over slaves. Here, with reference to creation and God's unlimited power overall that he has made, the Church in danger finds support and solace in the thought of God's absolute sovereignty. The term is applied to God in the New Testament elsewhere only in Luke 2:29 (where observe its relation to δοῦλον); 2 Peter 2:1; Jude 1:4, R.T. (of our Savior); and Revelation 6:10, where σύνδουλοι αὐτῶν immediately follows, as here in ver. 29 does \"thy servants.\" In the LXX. it sometimes answers to Elohim, and sometimes to Adonai. As regards the question how the whole assembly joined in this prayer, whether by a common inspiration, or by repeating the words after him that prayed them aloud (Alford), or by merely singing the second psalm (Baumgarten), or by all using what was already a formulary prepared for the needs of the Church (Meyer), it is difficult to speak positively, nor is it of any moment. Another possible explanation is that several members of the congregation, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, uttered brief prayers and praises, the consenting matter of which Luke thus puts together.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Who by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say for who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, T.R. and A.V.; Gentiles for heathen, A.V.; peoples for people, A.V. Who by the Holy Ghost, etc. The R.T. here is impossible, but the T.R. is perfectly easy and natural. The confusion in the manuscripts from which the R.T. is formed appears to have arisen from στόματος having been accidentally mistaken for πνεύματος, which led to other changes. Three readings resulted and seem to be combined: ὁ διὰ τοῦ πατρός ἡμῶν Δαβὶδ εἰπών: or, ὁ διὰ πνεύματος ἁγίου εἰπών: or the original one, ὁ διὰ στόματος Δαβὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών, which is preserved in the T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Set themselves in array for stood up, A.V.; Anointed for Christ, A.V. Set themselves in array, Παρίστημι does not specially mean \"to set themselves in array,\" which implies a battle, of which there is not question home, but it means simply \"to present\" or \"show themselves\" (Acts 1:3) \"to be ready,\" or, as in ver. 10, \"to stand.\" Anointed. The text in the whole citation follows the LXX. exactly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Of a truth in this city for of a truth, A.V. Servant for child (as in Acts 3:26), A.V.; didst anoint for hast anointed, A.V.; peoples for people, A.V. For of a truth, etc. The saying just quoted is proved to have been the word of God by its exact fulfillment in the heathen and Jewish rulers and peoples who were concerned in the crucifixion of the Lord Christ. In this city. This is omitted in the A.V. and T.R., but found in most uncials and Fathers, and adopted by Wordsworth, Alford, Meyer, Bengel. etc. Herod. St. Luke (Luke 23:1-12) is the only one of the evangelists who records the part taken by Herod in conjunction with Pontius Pilate in the condemnation of Christ. Possibly the inference may be that St. Luke was led to record it in his Gospel front know-tug of this application of Psalm it. to him and Pilate. Peoples, in the plural, either because of the \"many nations\" (Acts 2:5) from which the Jews of the dispersion came to Jerusalem, or with reference to the twelve tribes (see Genesis 28:3, \"Thou shalt be a multitude of peoples,\" Hebrew).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - To do for for to do, A.V.; foreordained to come to pass for determined before to be done, A.V. To do (for the sentiment, comp. Acts 2:23; Acts 3:18). They were gathered together for the purpose of executing, their own will, as they thought, but really to fulfil the purpose of God (see also Isaiah 10:5-15; Isaiah 37:26, 27). See here the comfort to the Church of looking upon God as the δεσπότης of the whole earth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Look upon for behold, A.V.; to speak thy word with all boldness for that with all boldness they may speak thy word, A.V. Lord. This time Κύριε (Kyrie), the word in the LXX. for Jehovah, and the special designation of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:36, etc.), but here applied to God the Father. Look upon; a more forcible rendering than the A.V. Look upon, for the purpose of frustrating and punishing. The only other place in the New Testament where the word (ἑπείδειν) occurs is in Luke 1:25, where the Lord \"looked upon\" Elisabeth to confer a blessing upon her. In 2 Chronicles 24:22, \"The Lord look upon it and require it,\" the LXX have the simple verb ἴδοι instead of ἐπίδοι. It is beautiful to notice how, in the heat of the unjust persecutions, the Church hands over her quarrel to her Lord, and is only careful that she be not stopped in her work by the threatenings of her enemies. To speak thy word with all boldness (for the word \"boldness,\" see ver. 13, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBy stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - While thou stretchest for by stretching, A.V.; thy for thine, A.V.; through for by, A.V.; Servant for child, A.V., as in ver. 27 and Acts 3:13, 26. While thou stretchest, etc. The A.V. seems preferable. It was the fact that, while they preached the Word of God, the Lord confirmed the Word with signs following, which gave them such superhuman courage to persevere in the face of death and bonds. And this was God s method and means of encouraging them. And that signs and wonders may be done. But this clause is better rendered, as Beza and Bengel render it, in dependence upon ἐν τῷ, and by signs and wonders being done, as the consequence of the stretching out of the hand of Jesus. The other ways of construing the sentence are either to make the clause, \"that signs and wonders may be done,\" dependent upon \"grant,\" which seems to be the meaning of the A.V., or else to take it, as Meyer does, as an independent clause, expressing the aim of the stretching out of the hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Wherein they were gathered for when they were assembled, A.V. When they had prayed. When they had finished the preceding prayer. The place was shaken, perhaps by a mighty wind, as in Acts 2:2. The word σαλεύεσθαι is properly used of ships or of the sea agitated and tossed by the wind; so Matthew 11:7, \"A reed shaken by the wind.\" But it is also applied to the rocking caused by an earthquake (Acts 16:26), which maybe the kind of shaking here meant. In this fresh outpouring or the Spirit, whereby they were enabled to speak the word of God with boldness, they had a direct and immediate answer to their prayer (see Isaiah 65:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Soul for of one soul, A.V.; and not one of them said for neither said any of them, A.V. The great increase in the number of believers had been recorded in ver. 4. And the state of public feeling alluded to in ver. 21 makes it likely that yet more may have been converted to the faith. This was very important, no doubt; but it was scarcely less so that this great multitude were one in heart and soul, closely united in the bonds of Christian fellowship and love.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - Their witness for witness, A.V. (τὸ μαρτύριον). Their witness. It was one of their chief functions as apostles to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (see Acts 1:22, note). Great grace, etc. Some understand this of the singular favor with which the people regarded them. But it is better to take it of the grace of God which abounded towards them in spiritual gifts and abundant unction and rich blessing, crowning their labors with success.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - For neither for neither, A.V.; among them any for any among them, A.V. One striking proof of the greatness of the Divine grace that was upon the Church at this time was that there was no such thing as want or poverty among them. The equality typified in the daily collection of manna was literally fulfilled among them (2 Corinthians 8:14, 15); for the rich sold their houses and lands, and laid the price of them at the apostles' feet, to be used for the common wants. The present participle in the Greek (πωλοῦντες... πιπρασκομένων) indicates the process as continuing (Meyer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Laid them for laid them downs A.V.; unto each... as any one for unto every man... as he, A.V., a change without an improvement. Laid them at the apostles' feet. A significant token of the place occupied by the apostles (as later by the bishops of the Church) as the trustees and dispensers of the Church's funds as well as of the Church's doctrines. Compare \"Ante pedes praetoris in fore expensum est auri pondo centum\" (Cie. pp. Flacco, quoted by Alford). We have, too, here an instance of the way in which Church institutions rose gradually as occasion gave birth to them. So the institution of deacons (Acts 6:2, 3), of presbyters or priests (Acts 14:23), of bishops (1 Timothy 1-3.), of Confirmation (Acts 8:14-17), appear to have come about in each case pro re nata.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Joseph for Joses, A.V., as Acts 1:23; Son of exhortation for The son of consolation, A.V.; a man of Cyprus by race for and of the country of Cyprus, A.V. Joseph. In the variation of manuscripts it is difficult to say which is right. Some (Grotius, Alford, etc.) consider the two forms as mere variations in writing the name Joseph. But it seems more probable that Joses is the same name as Josiah, only without the addition of the Divine Name (Jab) at the end (see Simon, 'Onomast.'). It is found as a proper name in the T.R. of Matthew 13:55; Matthew 27:56; Mark 6:3; Mark 15:40, 47; Luke 3:29 (Jose); and is not likely to have been substituted for the common name of Joseph. The Codex Sinaiticus has Joses only in Mark 15:40. The R.V. has Joseph in Matthew 13:55, and Joses in Matthew 27:56; Mark 6:3; Mark 15:40, 47. In Luke 3:29 the R.V. has Jesus. But Joses is probably right both here and in the above-cited passages. Barnabas; literally, son of prophecy; i.e. a prophet, as he is called in Acts 18:1. Probably his exhortations under the influence of the Holy Spirit in the Church assemblies were particularly stirring and edifying. The Greek version of the name, υἱὸς παρακλήσεως, should be rendered, as in R.V., Son of exhortation, for \"son of consolation? is a meaning which can hardly be got out of the Hebrew. The apostles seem here to have followed our Lord's example in naming the sons of Zebedee, sons of thunder. A man of Cyprus by race. The A.V. is less accurate, but it gives the sense better. Cyprus was the country where he was born and lived, as, it is likely, his fathers had done before him. But he was hardly, in our sense of the words, a Cypriot by race. We know that a great many Jews were settled in Cyprus (Philo, 'Leg. ad Caium.,'§ 36; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:4; Alford, on Acts 11:19); and we learn from Acts 13:5 that in Salamis alone there were several synagogues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs4:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHaving land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - A field for land, A.V.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Ananias (Ἀνανίας) In Nehemiah 3:23 the Hebrew name ענַנְיָה (God covers or protects) is thus rendered in the LXX. But the name occurs nowhere else. The very common name הֲנַנְיָה Hananiah (God is gracious), is also rendered in the LXX. Ananias (Ἀνανίας), and is doubtless the name meant here and in Acts 9:10; Acts 23:2, etc. Sapphira does not occur elsewhere. It is either derived from the Aramean שַׁפָירָה, beautiful, or from the Hebrew סַפִיר, a sapphire. A possession (see Acts 2:45). The kind of possession is not specified by the word itself, which applies to houses, fields, jewels, and wealth generally; but the nature of the property is shown by the word χωρίον, applied to it in vers. 3 and 8, which means especially\" a parcel of ground\" (John 4:5), \"a field\" (Acts 1:18, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thy for thine, A.V. Peter said. It was given to Peter on this occasion, by the Holy Ghost, to read the secrets of Ananias's heart, just as it was given to Elisha to detect Gehazi's lie (2 Kings 5:25, 26); and the swift punishment inflicted in both cases by the word of the man of God - leprosy in one case, and sudden death in the other - is another point of strong resemblance. To lie to the Holy Ghost. It is only one instance among many of the pure spiritual atmosphere in which the Church then moved, that a lie to the apostle was a lie to the Holy Ghost under whose guidance and by whose power the apostle acted. Ananias's fraud was an ignoring of the whole spiritual character of the apostles' ministry, and was accordingly visited with an immediate punishment. The death of Ananias and Sapphira was a terrible fulfillment of the promise, \"Whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained\" (John 20:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Did it not remain for was it not, A.V.; thy for thine own, A.V.; how is it that thou hast for why hast thou, A.V.; thy heart for thine heart, A.V. Did it not remain, etc.? The exact meaning is - Did it not remain to thee? i.e. unsold it was thine, and when sold the price of it was thine. There was no compulsion as regards giving it away. The act was one of deliberate hypocrisy - an attempt to deceive God himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Upon all that heard it for on all them that heard these things, A.V. and T.R.

The other that the authority of the apostles as the rulers of the Church was greatly strengthened by these miracles being wrought exclusively by their hands. We cannot understand either the external relations of the Church to the world, or the internal relations of the people to their spiritual rulers, unless we duly take count of these two things. With one accord (see Acts 4:24, note). In Solomon's porch (see Acts 3:11, note). It is quite true to nature that Solomon's porch, having been the scene of the miracle, became the place of frequent concourse. There is a difference of opinion among commentators as to whether the all refers to the whole Christian laity as in Acts 2:1, or to the apostles only. Alford thinks the latter, Meyer the former. The opinion that the whole body of Christians is meant seems most probable, both from the use of the words in Acts 2. I and from the phrase ὁμοθυμαδὸν (especially in connection with ἅπαμτες), which seems more applicable to a mixed multitude than to twelve colleagues like the apostles. You could hardly say that all the queen's ministers met in a Cabinet Council with one accord. There is no need for the parenthesis as in the A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But for and, A.V.; howbeit for but, A.V. The rest seems most naturally to mean those who were not included in the ἅπαντες, viz. the Jews as distinguished from the disciples. The effect 'of the miracles was that the Jews looked with awe and reverence upon the Apostolic Church, and none durst join them from mere curiosity or with any idle purpose. But, on the contrary, the people magnified them, treated them with the utmost respect, and spoke of them with all honor. Join himself (κολλᾶσθαι). The word occurs in the New Testament ten times, of which seven are in St. Luke's Gospel or in the Acts. The other three are in St. Paul's Epistles (see for the use of it in the sense it has here, Luke 15:15; Acts 8:29; Acts 9:26; Acts 10:28; Acts 17:34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Added to the Lord; as in Acts 11:24, not as in margin. Multitudes; πλήθη, found in the plural nowhere else in the New Testament.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTInsomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Even carried out for brought forth, A.V. and T.R.; that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow for that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by, A.V.; some one for some, A.V. Insomuch; not to be referred back to the first part of ver. 12, as indicated by the parenthesis in the A.V., but to the whole description of the Church's glorification in vers. 12-14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And there also came together the multitude from for there came also a multitude out of, A.V.; about Jerusalem for about unto Jerusalem, A.V.; folk for folks, A.V.; that were for which were, A.V. And there also came together, etc. One great result of these numerous miracles would be to manifest that the Lord Jesus was still with his Church as truly as when he was upon the earth (Matthew 28:20), and this manifestation remains for the comfort of his people, even now that such miracles have ceased. With regard to what is said in ver. 15 of the shadow of Peter being thought to have had a healing power, it may have been true that it had, as Christ could heal by a shadow as well as by a word or touch, but we cannot say for certain that it was so; anyhow, it was a marvelous season of refreshing to the Church, preparing her for the coming trial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - But for then, A.V.; they were filled for were filled, A.V.; jealousy for indignation, A.V. The high priest rose up. It was high time for him and his friends the Sadducees to be up and doing, if they wished to stop the spreading of the faith of Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. Which is the sect of the Sadducees (Acts 4:1, 2, note). It does not appear that Annas himself was a Sadducee, but his son was, and hence it is highly probable that the Sadducees should have attached themselves to Annas, and made a tool of him for suppressing the doctrine of the Resurrection. The sect; αἵρεσις (see Acts 15:5; Acts 24:5, 14; Acts 26:4; Acts 28:22). The word was applied first by Jews to Christians, and then by Christians to sects (1 Corinthians 11:19; Galatians 5:20; 2 Peter 2:1). Jealousy scarcely so well expresses the idea of ζῆλος here as indignation does. In the First Epistle of Clement, ζῆλος is applied to the anger of Cain, of Joseph's brethren, of the Israelites against Moses, of the persecution of St. Peter and St. Paul (iv., 5.). It is only occasionally that it means that kind of anger which we call jealousy. The high priest and his party were indignant at the defiance of their authority, and at the success of the doctrine which they had made it a special object to put down.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Laid hands (as Acts 4:3, A.V. and R.V.) for laid their hands, A.V. and T.R.; in public ward for in the common prison, A.V. Laid hands, etc. Laid their hands is equally right, even when αὑτῶν is omitted, as the translation of τὰς χεῖρας. There is no difference in the sense in the two renderings, or in the two passages, though in Acts 4:3 the phrase is ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας, and here ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους. In public ward. The A.V. is more idiomatic and expresses exactly what is meant by the phrase τηρήσει δημοσίᾳ. Meyer quotes the phrases τὸ δημόσιον in Thucydides, and οἰκία δημόσια in Xenophon for the common piton (see Acts 4:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - An angel for the angel, A.V.; out for forth, A.V. An angel, etc. The phrase is a translation of the Old Testament phrase מַלְאַך יְהוָה. But in Hebrew it is impossible to insert the definite article before יְהוָה, and therefore the phrase is properly rendered, \"the angel of the Lord.\" In the passage before us and other similar passages, Κύριος seems to stand for יְוָה, and therefore the rendering of the A.V. would seem to be right, in spite of what is said by eminent grammarians to the contrary. Compare, too, the phrases ὁδὸν εἰρήνηνς (Luke 1:19); ῤῆμα Θεοῦ (Luke 3:2); φωνὴ βοῶντος (Luke 3:4); and see especially Luke 2:9, where, ἄγγελος Κυρίου (\"the angel of the Lord,) and δόξα Κυρίου (\"the glory of the Lord\") stand in parallel clauses. The R.V. inconsistently renders the first \"an angel,\" and the second\" the glory.\" In like manner φωνὴ Κυρίου (Acts 7:31) is \"the voice of the Lord;\" and in Psalm 29. (28, Septuagint) 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, the LXX. have uniformly φωνὴ Κυρίου for קול יְהוָה (see Acts 8:26, note). Out (comp.

John 6:68, \"Thou hast the words of eternal life;\" see too the whole chapter and 1 John 1:1-3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - This for that, A.V.; about day. break for early in the morning, A.V.; prison-house for prison, A.V. About daybreak. In the hot climate of Jerusalem people are about very early in the meriting (comp. Matthew 26:57, 75). But the high priest, etc. The narrative would run more clearly if the passage were translated more literally, Now when the high priest and they that were with him were come (to the council-chamber the next day) they called together, etc. The narrative is taken up from vers. 17, 18. Having (ver. 18) put the apostles in prison, they met the next morning to decide how to punish them. The council (τὸ συνέδριον); i.e. in the Hebraeo-Greek, the Sanhedrim, the great council of the nation, consisting of seventy-two members, usually presided over by the high priest. It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (Matthew 5:22; Matthew 26:59; Mark 14:55, etc.; and Acts 22:30; Acts 23:1, etc.; above Acts 4:15). On the present occasion, besides the members of the Sanhedrim, there were gathered together all the senate (γερουσία) of the children of Israel, an expression which occurs only here, but which seems to comprise all the elders of the Jews, even though they were not members of the Sanhedrim. But some (Schleusner, Heinrich, etc.) understand it as merely another phrase for the Sanhedrim, added for explanation and amplification. The council, of course, were ignorant of the escape of the prisoners. The prison-house (δεσμωτήριον); \"prison\" (A.V.) represents φυλακή in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The officers that came for when the officers came and, A.V. and T.R.; and they returned for they returned, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Prison-house for prison, A.V., as in ver. 21; we found shut in all safety for truly found we shut with all safety, A.V. at the doors for without before the doors, A.V. and T.R. But the within at the end of the verse seems to require the without of the T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - The captain of the temple for the high priest and the captain, etc., A.V. and T.R.; words for things, A.V.; were much perplexed concerning them for doubted of them, A.V. The captain of the temple, etc. Meyer, followed by Alford, retains the T.R., in which the word for the high priest is ὁ ἱερεὺς. It is true that this word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament for \"the high priest.\" But in the Old Testament כֹהֵן is very frequently used to designate the high priest, as Exodus 29:30; Exodus 35:19; Numbers 3:32; 2 Chronicles 22:11; 2 Kings 22:10; 1 Kings 1:8, etc.; and in such places is represented by ἱερεὺς in the LXX. So that St. Luke may very probably have used it here where the context made the meaning clear, and where he intended to use the word ἀρχιερεῖς for \"the chief priests.\" For the captain, see above (Acts 4:1, note). He was especially interested as being, probably, the officer who had arrested the apostles the day before. Were much perplexed concerning. The verb (διαπορέω), which only occurs in the New Testament here and Acts 2:12, 10:17, Luke 9:7, and (in the middle voice) Luke 24:4, means properly \"to be in doubt which road to take,\" hence generally to be in doubt, perplexity. Them may apply either to the words, the strange things just reported to them, or to the apostles about whom the things were reported. It seems most natural to refer it to the words. They were in doubt and perplexity as to what it would all grow to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - And there came one for then came one, A.V.; behold for saying, Behold, A.V. and T.R.; the prison for prison, A.V.; in the temple standing for standing in the temple, A.V. Standing implying the calm, fearless attitude of the men. There is an apparent reference in the mind of the writer to the words of the angel in ver. 20, \"Go ye, and stand and speak.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - But without for without, A.V.; lest they should be, omitting ἵνα, for lest they should have been, with ἵνα, A.V. and T.R. Lest they should be, etc. The best way of construing the words, whether ἵνα is re-rained or not, is to make the clause \"lest they should be stoned\" depend upon \"not with violence;\" putting \"for they feared the people\" into a parenthesis; thus explaining why they thought it dangerous to use violence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSaying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - We straitly charged for did not we straitly command? A.V. and T.R.; not to for that ye should not, A.V.; teaching for doctrine, A.V. We straitly charged, etc.; ἐπερωτάω seems to require a question to follow. Your teaching (for the command, see Acts 4:18). Intend to bring, etc. Here the secret of the persecution comes out, The guilty conscience winced at every word which spake of Jesus Christ as living. The high priest, too, would not so much as name the name of Jesus. It was \"this name,\" \"this man;\" as in the Talmud, Jesus is most frequently spoken of as Teloni, i.e. \"such a one,\" in Spanish and Portuguese Fulano, or still more contemptuously as \"that man\" (Farrar, 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 108). This terror of blood-guiltiness is a striking comment on the saying recorded in Matthew 27:25.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - But for then, A.V.; the apostles for the other apostles, A.V.; must for ought to, A.V. Peter is the spokesman, the sentiment is that of the united apostolate. Must obey God, etc. The rule is a golden one for all men, all circumstances, and all time (comp. Acts 4:19). Peter does not deny having received the prohibition, but pleads the superior force of the command of God, as set forth in the following verses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Hanging him for and hanged, A.V. The God of our fathers, etc. Observe how carefully Peter preserves his own brotherhood with the Jews whom he was addressing, and the continuity of the New Testament with the Old Testament as being the sequel of the acts of the same God of Israel. Raised up; viz. from the dead; ἤγειρε, not ἀνίστη, as Acts 3:22, 26. Some, however (Calvin, Bengel, etc.), take ἤγειρε, as here used, to mean \"raised up\" in the wider sense of ἀναστῆσαι, as in the T.R. of Acts 13:23, where, however, the R.T. has ἤγαγε. Slew; viz. with your own hands, as διεχειρίσασθε means. It only occurs besides in Acts 26:27.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHim hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Did God exalt for hath God exalted, A.V.; remission for forgiveness, A.V. With his right hand; i.e. by his mighty power, as the instrument of Christ's exaltation. A Prince (Acts 3:15, note). Repentance first, \"a new heart and a new spirit\" (Ezekiel 36:26), and forgiveness next (comp. Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Witnesses for his witnesses, A.V. and T.R.; so is the Holy Ghost for so is also the Holy Ghost, A.V. and T.R. We are witnesses. The direct reference is to the command recorded in Acts 1:8, which they felt imperatively bound to obey. So is the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost bare witness to the gospel preached by the apostles by the powers which he gave them to heal and work miracles, and by the conversion of many who heard the word: \"the gospel preached with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven\" (1 Peter 1:12). Mark the solemnity and authority which Peter claimed for the gospel by thus asserting that the Holy Ghost was the witness with the apostles to the truth of their testimony concerning Jesus Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - But they, when they heard this, for when they heard that, they, A.V.; were minded for took counsel, A.V. and T.R. (ἐβούλοντο for ἐβουλεύοντο, as also Acts 15:39). The word for were cut to the heart (διέπριοντο) is found only here and in Acts 7:54, where the full phrase is given. It means literally, in the active voice, \"to saw asunder,\" and is so used by the LXX. in 1 Chronicles 20:2. In Hebrews 11:37 it is the simple verb πρίω which is used; πρίω and several of its compounds are surgical terms.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - But there for there, A.V.; in honor of for in reputation among, A.V.; the men for the apostles, A.V. and T.R.; while for space, A.V. A Pharisee named Gamaliel. St. Luke had mentioned (Acts 4:1 and Acts 5:17) that there was an influential party of Sadducees in the Sanhedrim. He, therefore, now specially notes that Gamaliel was a Pharisee. There can be no doubt that this alone would rather dispose him to resist the violent counsels of the Sadducean members, and the more so as the doctrine of the Resurrection was in question (see Acts 23:6-8). Moreover, Gamaliel was noted for his moderation. That Gamaliel here named is the same as that of Acts 22:3, at whose feet St. Paul was brought up at Jerusalem, and who is known in the Talmud as Rabban Gamaliel the elder (to distinguish him from his grandson of the same name, the younger), the grandson of Hillel, the head of the school of Hillel, and at some time president of the Sanhedrim, one of the most famous of the Jewish doctors (as the title Rabban, borne by only six others, shows), seems certain, though it cannot absolutely be proved. The description of him as a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people; the allusion to him as a great teacher, learned in the perfect manner of the Law of the fathers, and one whose greatness would be as a shield to his pupils, in Acts 22:3; the exact chronological agreement; the weight he possessed in the Sanhedrim, in spite of the Sadducean tendencies of the high priest and his followers; and the agreement between his character as written in the Talmud and as shown in his speech and in the counsel given in it, seem to place his identity beyond all reasonable doubt. There does not seem to be any foundation for the legend in the Clementine Recognitions, that he was in secret a Christian. If the prayer used in the synagogues, \"Let there be no hope to them that apostatize from the true religion; and let heretics, how many soever they he, all perish as in a moment,\" be really his composition, as the Jews say, he certainly had no inclination to Christianity ('Prid. Conn.,' 1:361).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - He said for said, A.V.; as touching these men transposed from the order of the A.V.; are about to do for intend to do, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Giving himself out for boasting himself, A.V.; dispersed for scattered, A.V.; came for brought, A.V. Rose up Theudas. A very serious chronological difficulty arises hero. The only Theudas known to history is the one about whom Josephus writes ('Ant. Jud.,' 20:5), quoted in full by Eusebius ('Ecclesiastes Hist.,'2:11) as having pretended to be a prophet, having lured a number of people to follow him to the banks of the Jordan, by the assurance that he would part the waters of the river, and as having been pursued by order of Cuspius Fadus, the Procurator of Judaea, when numbers of his followers were slain and taken prisoners, and Theudas himself had his head cut off. But Fadus was procurator in the reign of Claudius Caesar, immediately after the death of King Agrippa, ten or twelve years after the time when Gamaliel was speaking, and about thirty years after the time at which Gamaliel places Theudas. Assuming St. Luke to be as accurate and correct here as he has been proved to be in other instances where his historical accuracy has been impugned, three ways present themselves of explaining the discrepancy. 1. Josephus may have misplaced the adventure of Theudas by some accidental error. Considering the vast number of Jewish insurrections from the death of Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem, such a mistake is not very improbable. 2. There may have been two adventurers of the name of Theudas, one in the reign of Augustus Caesar, and the other in the reign of Claudius; and so both the historians may be right, and the apparent discrepancy may have no real existence (see Wordsworth, in loc.). 3. The person named Theudas by Gamaliel may be the same whom Josephus speaks of ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 4:2) by the common name of Simon, as gathering a band of robbers around him, and making himself king at Herod's death ('Sonntag,' cited by Meyer, etc.). But he was killed by Gratus, and the insurrection suppressed. A variety in this last mode has also been suggested (Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia'), viz. to understand Theudas to be an Aramaic form of Theodotus, and the equivalent Hebrew form of Theodotus to be מַתִתְיָה, Matthias, and so the person meant by Theudas to be a certain Matthias who with one Judas made an insurrection, when Herod the Great was dying, by tearing down the golden eagle which Herod had put over the great gate of the temple, and who was burnt alive with his companions, after defending his deed in a speech of great boldness and constancy ('Ant. Jud' 17:6). A consideration of these methods of explaining the apparent contradiction between the two historians shows that no certainty can without further light be arrived at. But it may be observed that it is quite impossible to suppose that any one so well informed and so accurate as St. Luke is could imagine that an event that he must have remembered perfectly, if it happened under the procuratorship of Fadus, had happened before the disturbances caused by Judas of Galilee, at least thirty years before. But it is most certain that Josephus's account of Theudas agrees better with Gamaliel's notice than that of either of the other persons suggested, irrespective of the identity of name. The first way of explaining the difficulty above proposed has, therefore, most probability in it. But some further corroboration of this explanation may be found in some of the details of Theudas's proceedings given by Josephus. He tells us that Theudes persuaded a great number of people to \"collect all their possessions\" and follow him to the banks of the Jordan, where he promised, like a second Elijah, to part the waters for them to pass over; that they did so, but that Fadus sent a troop of horse after them, who slew numbers of them, and amongst them their leader. Now, if this happened when the business of the census was beginning to be agitated, after the deposition of Archelaus (A.D. 6 or 7), all is plain. Theudas declaimed as a prophet against submitting to the census of their goods ordered by Augustus. The people were of the same mind. Theudas persuaded them that, if they brought all their goods to the banks of the Jordan, he would divide the stream and enable them to carry them over to the other side out of reach of the tax-gatherer. And so they made the attempt. But this was an act of rebellion against the Roman power, and a method of defeating the purpose of the census, which must be crushed at once. And so the people were pursued and slaughtered. But apart from the census of their goods, one sees no motive either for the attempt to carry away their property, or for the slaughter of an unarmed multitude by the Roman cavalry. So that the internal evidence is in favor of St. Luke's collocation of the incident, at the same time that his authority as a contemporary historian is much higher than that of Josephus. Still, one desiderates some more satisfactory proof of the error of Josephus, and some account of how he fell into it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs5:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37 - Enrolment for taxing, A.V.; some of the for much, A.V.; as many for even as many, A.V.; scattered abroad for dispersed, A.V. Judas of Galilee, otherwise called the Gaulonite, as a native of Gamala, in Gaulonitis. He was probably called a Galilaean because Galilee was the seat of his insurrection (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18, 1:1 and 6; also 'Bell. Jud.,' 2. 8:1; 17:8). He was the great leader of the Jews in opposing the census ordered by Augustus, after the deposition of Archelaus, and carried out by Cyrenius, or rather P. Sulpicius Quirinus, the Propraetor of Syria, with the assistance of Cumanus, the subordinate Governor of Judaea. Judas, with Zadoc his coadjutor, was the founder of a fourth Jewish sect, nearly allied to the Pharisees, and his sedition was founded on his philosophic tenets. Josephus speaks of him as the author of all the seditions, tumults, slaughters, sieges, devastations, plunder, famines, ending with the burning of the temple, which afflicted his unhappy country. He gives no account of his death. But his two sons, James and Simon, were crucified by Tiberius Alexander, the successor of Cuspius Fadus. Another son, Menahem, having collected and armed a large band of robbers and other insurgents, after a partially successful attack on the Roman camp at Jerusalem, was miserably slain. The enrolment (ἡ ἀπογραφή, as Luke 2:1). The purpose of Augustus, which had been delayed some years from causes not accurately known, perhaps in deference to some remonstrance from Herod the Great, was now carried into effect. Quirinus was sent, apparently the second time, as Proprsetor of Syria, to which Judaea was now attached, with Cumanus under him as Procurator of Judaea, to make a valuation of all their property. The Jews had been first persuaded by the high priest Joazar, i.e. apparently in the end of Herod's reign, or the beginning of Archelaus's, to submit to what they greatly disliked, but were now roused to insurrection by Judas of Galilee ('Ant.,' 18, 1:1). He also perished. Nothing is known of his death beyond this notice of it. Scattered abroad.

It was for the sake of such that the Alexandrine Version of the Scriptures, commonly called the LXX., was made. Hebrews; Palestinian and other Jews, who spoke Aramean (2 Corinthians 11:21; Philippians 3:5; Acts 21:40), as opposed to the Hellenists. Their widows. We learn incidentally by this phrase that one of the earliest Christian institutions was an order of widows, who were maintained at the common cost. We find them in the Church of Joppa (Acts 9:41), and in the Church of Ephesus (1 Timothy 5:3, 9, 10, 11, 16). They gave themselves to prayer and to works of mercy. Daily; καθημερινός only occurs here in the New Testament, and rarely in Greek writers; ἐφημερινός, of a daily fever, is used by Hippocrates, and may possibly have suggested the use of this rare word to Luke the physician.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And for then, A.V.; fit for reasons, A.V.; forsake for leave, A.V.

The English reader should remember that the \"ministration\" of ver. 1, the \"serve\" of this verse, and the \"deacon\" which was the name of the new officers, are all forms of the same Greek word (διακονία διακονεῖν διάκονος). In ver. 4 \"the ministry of the Word\" is opposed to \"the daily ministration\" of meat. The passage gives a necessary warning to the ministers of God's Word not to spend too much time and strength upon any secular work, even though it be a work of charity. They must give themselves to the Word of God and to prayer.

So in Hebrews 11:5 it is said of Enoch that \"he had witness borne to him that he pleased God,\" and in Hebrews 11:4 of Abel that \"he had witness borne to him that he was righteous;\" and so in Acts 10:22 Cornelius is said to be a man \"well reported of by all the nation of the Jews.\" In Acts 16:2 Timothy is said to be \"well reported of (ἐμαρτυρεῖτο) by the brethren.\" The Spirit. The number seven was, perhaps, fixed upon with reference to the exigencies of the service, some think because there were seven tables to be supplied; and partly perhaps from seven being the sacred number, the number of completeness - seven Churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven children (1 Samuel 2:5), seven times (Psalm 119:164). From seven having been the number of the first deacons arose the custom in some Churches of always having seven deacons, which continued some centuries in the Church of Rome. One of the Canons of the Council of Neo-caesarea (An). 314) enacted that \"there ought to be but seven deacons in any city,\" and St. Mark is said to have ordained seven deacons at Alexandria (see Bingham, 'Christ. Antia' vol. 1. p. 232). But the needs of the Churches gradually superseded all such restrictions. Whom we may appoint. The multitude elect, the apostles appoint. The apostolate appears as the sole ministry of the Church at first. From the apostolate is evolved first the diaconate, afterwards the presbyterate, as the need for each arose (Acts 14:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Continue steadfastly in for give ourselves continually to, A.V.; in (the ministry) for to, A.V.

It is used of persons and things to which any one adheres closely and perseveringly, which are put in the dative case, as here. But sometimes it has the prepositions ἐν or εἰς after it, as in Acts 5:46; Hist. of Susann. 7; Romans 13:6. Ver. 5. - Holy Spirit for Holy Ghost, A.V. The mention of Stephen, and the narrative which follows leading up from Stephen's martyrdom to St. Paul (Acts 7:60), show to what the writer is tending. He selects the incidents in the history of the Church at Jerusalem which connect themselves most directly with that after history which was the object he had in view. It has been thought by some that the Greek character of all seven names is an indication that they were Hellenists. Such a conclusion, however, is not warranted, as many Jews who were not Hellenists had Greek or Latin names, e.g. Paul, Sylvanus, Aquila, Priscilla, Marcus, Justus, Petrus, Didymus, etc. At the same time, it is likely that some of them were. One, Nicolas, was a proselyte. The object, doubtless, was to ensure perfect fairness of distribution of the Church charities. Stephen and Philip (Acts 8:5, etc.; Acts 21:8) are the only two of whom we know anything beyond their names.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. They did not pray without imposition of hands, nor did they lay hands on them without prayer. So in the sacraments, in confirmation, and ordination, the outward sign or rite is accompanied by prayer for the thing signified. And God's grace is given through the sacrament or rite in answer to the prayer of faith (see Acts 8:15, and the Office for Baptism, the Prayer of Consecration in the Office for Holy Communion, and the Confirmation and Ordination Services). (For the laying on of hands as a mode of conveying a special grace and blessing, see Numbers 27:3; Deuteronomy 34:9; Matthew 19:13-15; Luke 4:40; Acts 8:17; Acts 13:3; 1 Timothy 5:22; Hebrews 6:2.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Exceedingly for greatly, A.V.

The addition of a great multitude of priests was an important incident in the Church's history, both as they were a higher order of men, and a class very liable to be prejudiced against the faith which would rob them of their importance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Grace for faith, A.V. and T.R.; wrought for did, A.V.; signs for miracle, A.V. Power (Acts 1:8, note); power to work miracles especially, but also other spiritual power beyond his own natural strength (see ver. 10). This power showed itself in the signs and wonders which he wrought.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - But for then, A.V.; certain of them that were for certain, A.V.; of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians for Cyrenians and Alexandrians, A.V.; Asia for of Asia, A.V. Of the synagogue, etc. There were said to have been four hundred and eighty synagogues in Jerusalem alone in the time of our Savior (Olshausen, on Matthew 4:23). But this is probably a fanciful number; only it may be taken as an indication of the great number of such places of Jewish worship. Tiberias is said to have had twelve synagogues. Ten grown-up people was the minimum congregation of a synagogue. It seems by the enumeration of synagogues in our text that the foreign Jews had each their own synagogue at Jerusalem, as Chrysostom supposes, where men of the same nation attended when they came to Jerusalem; for the construction of the sentence is to supply before Κυρηναίων and again before Ἀλεξανδρέων the same words as precede Λιβερτίνων, viz. καὶ τῶν ἐκ τῆς συναγωγῆς τῆς λεγομένης, SO as to mean \"and certain of them that were of the synagogue called of the Cyrenians,\" and so on. The very numerous Jews of Cyrene and of Alexandria would doubtless require each a synagogue for themselves. The Libertines were, as Chrysostom explains it, \"freedmen of the Romans.\" They are thought to consist chiefly of the descendants of the Jews who were taken prisoners by Pompey, and deported to Rome, who were afterwards emancipated and returned to Judaea, though some (Meyer, 1:1) settled in Rome. Tacitus, under the year A.D. , speaks of four thousand Libertini, infected with Jewish or Egyptian superstitions, as banished to Sardinia ('Annal.,' 2. 85.). Many of these must have been Jews. Josephus, who tells the same story as Tacitus, though somewhat differently, says they were all Jews ('Ant. Jud.,' 18, 3:5). The Cyrenians. Cyrene was the chief city in North Africa, and a great Jewish colony. Numbers of Jews were settled there in the time of Ptolemy Lagus ('Cont. Apion.,' 2:4), and are said by Josephus (quoting Strabo) to have been a fourth part of the inhabitants of the city ('Ant. Jud.,'14. 7:2). Josephus also quotes edicts of Augustus and of M. Agrippa, confirming to the Jews of Cyrene the right to live according to their own laws, and specially to send money for the temple at Jerusalem (16. 6:5). Jews from \"the parts of Libya about Cyrene\" are mentioned in Acts 2:10; Simon, who bore our Savior's cross, was \"a man of Cyreue;\" there were \"men of Cyrene\" at Jerusalem at the time of the persecution that arose about Stephen (Acts 11:19); and \"Lucius of Cyrene\" is mentioned in Acts 13:1. It was natural, therefore, that the Cyrenians should have a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem. Of the Alexandrians. Alexandria had a Jewish population of 100,000 at this time, equal to two-fifths of the whole city. The famous Philo, who was in middle age at this time, was an Alexandrian, and the Alexandrian Jews were the most learned of their race. The Jews settled in Alexandria in the time of Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Lagus. The LXX. Version of the Scriptures was made at Alexandria primarily for their use. We may be sure, therefore, that they had a synagogue at Jerusalem. And of them of Cilicia. The transition from the African Jews to those of Asia is marked by changing the form of phrase into καὶ τῶν ἀπὸ Κιλικίας. There were many Jews in Cilicia, and this doubtless influenced St. Paul in preaching there, as well as the fact of its being his own native province (see Acts 15:23, 41; Galatians 1:21). Josephus makes frequent mention of the Jews in the wars between the Ptolemies and Antiochus the Great, with whom the Jews sided, and in consequence were much favored by him. And it is thought that many who had been driven out from their homes by the wars, and others who were brought by him from Babylonia, settled in his time in Cilicia, as well as other parts of his Asiatic dominions. Seleucus also encouraged the Jews to settle in the towns of Asia in his kingdom, by giving them the freedom of the cities and putting them on an equal footing (ἰσοτίμους) with Macedonians and Greeks ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 3:1, 3). Asia; meaning the same district as in Acts 2:9 (where see note). Evidence of the abundance of Jews in Asia crops up throughout the Acts (8. 16, 24, 42, 45; 14:19; 16:13; 18:26, 28; 19:17; 20:21). That the Jews of Asia were very bigoted we learn from Acts 21:27 (see also 1 Peter 1:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Withstand for resist, A.V.

Blasphemous words against Moses. It must be remembered that at this time the whole Jewish people were in a state of ill-suppressed frenzy and most sensitive jealousy for the honor of the Mosaic institutions - feelings which broke out in constant revolts against the Roman power. The accusation against the apostles of speaking blasphemies against Moses was therefore the most likely one they could have pitched upon to stir up ill will against them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Seized for caught, A.V.; into for to, A.V.

Blessed servant to tread so closely in thy Lord's steps! (comp. Matthew 5:11, 12; 1 Peter 4:14-16). This holy place; the Sanhedrim sat in one of the chambers of the temple, called Gazith.

If Stephen had said anything like what Jesus said to the woman of Samaria (John 4:21) or to his disciples (Mark 13:2), or what the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews wrote (8. 13), or what St. Paul wrote to the Colossians (Colossians 2:16, 17), his words might easily be misrepresented by false witnesses, whose purpose it was to swear away his life. This Jesus of Nazareth. The phrase is most contemptuous. This (οῦτος), so often rendered in the A.V. \"this fellow\" (Matthew 26:61, 71; John 9:29, etc.), is of itself an opprobrious expression (comp. Acts 7:40), and the ὁ Ναζωραῖος, the Nazarene, is intended to be still more so.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Fastening their eyes for looking steadfastly, A.V.

Haran for Charran, A.V. Brethren and fathers. The Greek is ἄνδρες ἀδελφοὶ (i.e. \"men who are also my brethren\") καὶ πατέρες. He adds \"and fathers\" out of respect to the elder and more dignified portion of the Sanhedrim. It seems probable that Stephen, as a Hellenist Jew, spoke in Greek, which is borne out by the quotations being from the LXX. (see Alford), though Meyer and others think he spoke in Hebrew. Greek was generally understood at this time by all educated persons (see Roberts, 'Discussions on Gospels,' Acts 2. - 7.). The speech itself is almost universally admitted to bear strong internal marks of genuineness and originality. But different estimates have been formed of its excellence, and different explanations given of its scope and object. Difficult but striking; long and prolix;\" \"at first sight absurd and out of place;\" \"wonderful but difficult;\" \"of inestimable value;\" \"a speech containing many things which don't seem much to the point;\" \"a powerful speech;\" a speech combining \"the address of the advocate and the boldness of the martyr;\" - are some of the estimates that have been formed of it by modern commentators. As regards its scope and object, the two main clues to it are the accusation which Stephen rose to rebut, and the application with which he ended in vers. 51-53. If we keep these two things steadily in view, we shall not be very far wrong if we say that Stephen sought to clear himself by showing,NEWLINENEWLINE(1) by his historical summary, what a true and thorough Israelite he was in heart and feeling and fellowship with the fathers of his race, and therefore how unlikely to speak blasphemous words against either Moses or the temple;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) how Moses himself had foretold the coming of Christ as a prophet like himself, to enunciate some new doctrines;NEWLINENEWLINE(3) how at every stage of their history their fathers had resisted those who were sent to them by God, and that now his judges were playing the same part. Perhaps it may be further true, as Chrysostom explains it (Hom. 15, 16, 17.), that his intention in the early part of the speech was to show \"that the promise was made before the place, before circumcision, before sacrifice, before the temple,\" in accordance with St. Paul's argument (Galatians 3:16-18); and that therefore the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant could not be dependent upon the Law or the temple. The God of glory. This unusual phrase identifies God, of whom Stephen speaks, with the God whose visible glory was seen by the patriarchs (Genesis 12:7; Genesis 18:1; Genesis 26:2; Genesis 28:12, 13; Genesis 35:9; Exodus 24:16, 17; Numbers 16:19; Isaiah 6; John 12:41). St. Paul uses a similar phrase, \"The Lord of glory '(1 Corinthians 2:8). Our father. He thus identifies himself with his judges, whom he had just called \"brethren.\" In Mesopotamia, which would be in Hebrew \"Aram of the two rivers.\" The exact place, as we learn from Genesis 11:31, was \"Ur of the Chaldees;\" whence the Israelites were taught to say (Deuteronomy 26:5), \"An Aramcan ready to perish was my father.\" That this appearance was in Ur, before he dwelt in Haran, is manifest from Genesis 11:31, because it is there said that they went forth from Ur \"to go into the land of Canaan,\" which makes it quite certain that the appearance of God to Abraham had preceded their leaving Ur, and was the cause of it. And this is confirmed by Genesis 15:7; Nehemiah 9:7; and Josephus ('Ant.,' 1. 7:1). Moreover, the very language of the call shows plainly that it came to him when he was living in his native country, among his kindred, and in his father's house, i.e. at Ur, not in Haran, where they were only sojourners. There is nothing the least unusual, in Hebrew narrative, in the writer going back to any point in the preceding narrative with which the subsequent narrative is connected. Genesis 12. I precedes in point of time Genesis 11:31; similar examples are Genesis 37:5, 6; Judges 20, passim; 1 Samuel 16:21 compared with 1 Samuel 17:28; 1 Samuel 22:20, 21, compared with 1 Samuel 23:6; and many more. It is, however, of course possible that a fresh call may have been given after Terah's death, though it is by no means necessary to suppose it. Another imaginary difficulty arises from the statement in Genesis 12:4 that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran, that Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and that Terah died at the age of two hundred and five; and from the statement in ver. 4 of this chapter that Abram did not leave Haran till Terah's death. From which it is concluded that Terah must have lived sixty years after Abram's departure (70 + 75 + 60 = 205). But the whole difficulty arises from the gratuitous supposition that Abram was Terah's firstborn because he is named first. If Terah were a hundred and thirty at the birth of Abram, he would be two hundred and five when Abram was seventy-five. Now, there is absolutely nothing to forbid the supposition that such was his age. It does not follow that because Abram is named first he was the eldest. He might be named first as being by far the most illustrious of the three, he might be named first because the subsequent genealogies - Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs - were deduced from him. There may, too, have been other sons of Terah, not named here because nothing was going to be said about them. Nahor is mentioned because Rebekah was his granddaughter (Genesis 24:15, 24) and Rachel his great-granddaughter. And Haran is mentioned because he was the father of Lot. Others, whether sons or daughters, would not be mentioned. If Terah, therefore, began to have children when he was seventy, it is quite probable that Abram may not have been born till he was a hundred and thirty. That the son named first need not necessarily be the eldest is clear from the order in which Shem, Ham, and Japheth are named, whereas it appears from Genesis 9:24 that Ham was the youngest, and from Genesis 10:2, 21 (according to the A.V. and the LXX., Symmachus, the Targum of Onkelos, and the old Jewish commentators), that Japheth was the eldest. In Joshua 24:4 God says, \"I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau,\" though Esau was the elder; and so Hebrews 11:20. So again in Exodus 5:20 we read, \"Moses and Aaron\" (see also Exodus 40:31; Numbers 16:43; Joshua 24:5; 1 Samuel 12:6; etc.), though it appears from 1 Chronicles 6:3 that Aaron was the eldest. So again we read in Genesis 48:5, \"Thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh,\" and in ver. 20, \"God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh,\" though in ver. I of the same chapter they are named according to the true order of birth - \"Manasseh and Ephraim.\" It is, therefore, an unwarrantable inference that Abram was the eldest son because he is named first; and with the removal of this inference the difficulty vanishes; and Stephen was quite accurate when he said that God appeared to Abraham in Ur, before he dwelt in Haran, and that he did not move from Haran till the death of Terah. Haran. Charran in A.V. marks the difference between Haran (הָרָן), Lot's father, and the name of the place (הָרָן). It is called \"the city of Nahor\" (Genesis 24:10 compared with Genesis 47:43). It still exists as an Arab village, with the name of Harran (see 'Dictionary of Bible').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Thy land for thy country, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Haran for Charran, A.V.; God removed for he removed, A.V.

And this sojourning as strangers and pilgrims lasted altogether four hundred and thirty years, vie. two hundred and fifteen years in Canaan, and two hundred and fifteen in Egypt; which agrees exactly with St. Paul's reckoning in round numbers of four hundred years from the giving of the promise to Abraham to the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai (Galatians 3:17). The \"four hundred years\" must not be taken in connection with the bondage\" and the ill treatment which characterized the last half of the period, but as spoken of the whole period during which they had not possession of the promised land. Bring them into bondage. So the LXX.; but the Hebrew, as rendered in the A.V., has \"and they shall serve them.\" But some (see Gesenius, 'Thes.') render the Hebrew as the LXX. Do. Four hundred years. This is a round number, as in Genesis 15:13. The exact time, as given in Exodus 12:40, 41, was four hundred and thirty years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Which for whom, A.V. And serve me in this place. These words are not in Genesis 15, from which the preceding words are quoted. Instead of καὶ λατρεύσουσι μοί ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, the LXX, following the Hebrew, have μετὰ ἀποσκεύης πολλῆς, \"with great substance.\" The words \"serve me in this place,\" seem certainly to have been suggested by Exodus 3:12, \"Ye shall serve God upon this mountain;\" but they give a perfectly correct account of what happened in this case.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Jacob the twelve for Jacob begat the twelve, A.V. He gave him the covenant of circumcision, subsequently to the gift of the land by promise. The argument suggested is apparently the same as St. Paul's in Romans 4:10-17.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him, for moved with envy sold Joseph, A.V., more correctly, and in accordance with Genesis 37:11, LXX.; and for but, A.V. Moved with jealousy, etc. Here breaks out that part of Stephen's argument which went to show how the Israelites had always ill-used their greatest benefactors, and resisted the leaders sent to them by God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Before for in the sight of, A.V.

Three score and fifteen souls. In Genesis 46:26, 27, the statement is very precise that \"all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten,\" including Joseph and his two sons. Moreover, the accuracy of the number is tested in two ways. First, the names of the sons and daughters of each patriarch are given, and they are found, on counting them, to amount to exactly seventy. And then the totals of the descendants of each of Jacob's four wives is given separately, and again the total is exactly seventy (33 + 16 + 14 + 7 = 70). It is true that the computation in ver. 26 does not agree with the above, for it makes the number of Jacob's descendants, exclusive of Joseph and his two sons, sixty-six instead of sixty-seven, which is the number according to the two above computations, and consequently the total number (when Joseph and his two sons are added) sixty-nine instead of seventy. But this is such a manifest contradiction that it seems almost a necessity to suppose a clerical error, שֵׁשׁ for שֶׁבַע, caused perhaps by the preceding שִׁשִׁים. It is also a singular anomaly that, in the enumeration of Leah's descendants, as well as in the general enumeration, Er and Onan are distinctly reckoned as well as mentioned. Jacob himself is nowhere reckoned in the Bible, though he is in the commentaries. But when we turn to the LXX., we find that in Genesis 46:20 there are added to Manasseh and Ephraim Machir the son and Gilead the grandson of Manasseh; and Suthelah and Taam the sons, and Edom (meaning Eran, LXX. Eden, Numbers 26:36) the grandson, of Ephraim, making the descendants of Rachel eighteen (it should be nineteen if Huppim, Genesis 46:21, is added) instead of fourteen; the number sixty-six of ver. 26 is preserved; the number of Joseph's descendants is given as nine (Huppim apparently being now reckoned), which, added to sixty-six, makes seventy-five; and accordingly in ver. 27 the LXX. read ψυχαὶ ἑβδομηκονταπέντε (\"seventy-five souls\"), instead of \"three score and ten.\" But except in the addition of these five names of Joseph's grand and great-grand-children, the LXX. support the Hebrew text, even in the strange sixty-six of ver. 26. Stephen, as a Hellenist, naturally follows the LXX. But the question arises - How are we to understand the lists? Genesis 46:8 says, \"These are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;\" and one naturally expects to find the names only of those who are described in vers. 5-7 as the migratory party from Canaan to Egypt. This expectation is somewhat disturbed by Er and Onan being included in the enumeration. This may, however, be accounted for by Pharez and Zerah being reckoned as their seed. But is it likely that Hezron and Hamul the sons of Pharez, and the other great-grandsons of Jacob, were born before the descent into Egypt? The answer to this is that, as Jacob was a hundred and thirty years old when he came down to Egypt (Genesis 47:28), there is no improbability in his having great-grandchildren (allowing forty years for a generation); on the contrary, every likelihood that he should. But on the other hand, as Joseph could not have been above fifty when Jacob came down to Egypt (30 + 14 + X.), Genesis 41:46, 29, 30, it does not seem likely or possible that Joseph should have had grown-up grandsons and a great-grandson, as the LXX. make him have. Indeed, to all appearance Manasseh and Ephraim were unmarried young men at the time that Jacob blessed them (Genesis 48:11, 16; Genesis 50:23). Therefore we may conclude certainly that the additional numbers of the LXX. are incorrect, if understood literally, of these who came down with Jacob from Canaan to Egypt. But there is nothing improbable in Benjamin having ten children. Judah, to whom grandchildren are attributed, was Jacob's fourth son, and might be forty or fifty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Asher, to whom also grandsons are attributed, was the eighth son, and might be twenty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Still, considering that Er and Onan are reckoned among those who came down to Egypt, it would not be surprising to find that some of those mentioned in the list were born after Jacob's arrival, but included on some principle which we do not understand. In other words, a literal interpretation of the statement of the Hebrew Bible involves no impossibilities, but a literal interpretation of the statement of the LXX. does.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - And for so, A.V.; he died, himself for died, he, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - And they were for and were, A.V.; unto Shechem for into Sychem, A.V., i.e. the Hebrew for the Greek form of the name (Genesis 34:2); tomb for sepulcher, A.V.; a price in silver for a sum of money, A.V.; Hamor for Erect, A.V. (Hebrew for Greek form); in Shechem for the father of Sychem, A.V. and T.R. As regards the statement in the text, two distinct transactions seem at first sight to be mixed up. One, that Abraham bought the field of Machpelah of Ephron the Hittite for a burial-place, where he and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah, were buried (Genesis 24:16, 17, 19; Genesis 25:9, 10; Genesis 35:27-29; Genesis 49:29-31); the other, that Jacob \"bought a parcel of a field..., at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money,\" where the bones of Joseph were buried by Joshua (Genesis 33:19; Genesis 50:25; Joshua 24:32), and where, according to a tradition still surviving in the days of St. Jerome, the other patriarchs were also buried ('Epistol.'86,\" She came to Sichem, now called Neapolis (or Nablous), and from thence visited the tombs of the twelve patriarchs\"). See also Jerome, 'De Optimo Genere Interpretandi. All Jewish writers, however, are wholly silent\" about this tradition, perhaps from jealousy of the Samaritans (Lightfoot, vol. 8. p. 423). And Josephus affirms that all but Joseph were buried at Hebron ('Ant. Jud.,'2. 8:2); and that their beautiful marble monuments were to be seen at Hebron in his day. In the cave of Machpelah, however, there is no tomb of any of the twelve patriarchs except Joseph; and his so-called tomb is of a different character and situation from the genuine ones (Stanley's 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' 1st series, pp. 498-500. See also 'Sermons in the East': 'The Mosque of Hebron'). But on looking closer at the text it appears pretty certain that only Shechem was in Stephen's mind. For first he speaks of Shechem at once, And were carried over unto Shechem. And adds and were laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem. Except the one word \"Abraham,\" the whole sentence points to Shechem. What he says of Shechem is exactly in accordance with Genesis 33:18, 19. And what he says of their fathers being carried over and buried at Shechem is exactly true of Joseph's bones, as related in Joshua 24:32. So that the one difficulty is the word \"Abraham.\" It seems much more probable that this word should have been interpolated by some early transcriber, who saw no nominative case to ὠνήσατο, and who had in his mind a confused recollection of Abraham's purchase, than that Stephen, who shows such thorough knowledge of the Bible history, should have made a gross mistake in such a well-known and famous circumstance as the purchase of the field of Machpelah, or that Luke should have perpetuated it had he made it in the hurry of speech. It cannot be affirmed with certainty that Stephen confirms the story of the other patriarchs being buried at Shechem, though possibly he alludes to the tradition. The plural, \"they were carried,\" etc., might be put generally, though only Joseph was meant (as Matthew 27:44; Matthew 26:8 compared with Luke 23:39; John 12:4), or \"the bones of Joseph\" might possibly be the subject, though not expressed. Lightfoot - followed by Bishop Wordsworth, who thinks that Abraham really did buy a field of Ephron in Sychem, when he was there (Genesis 12:6)-would thus be right in supposing that the point of Stephen's remark was that the patriarchs were buried in Shechem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - As for when, A.V.; vouchsafed unto for had sworn to, A.V. and T.R.

Jud.,' 2. 9:5, 7) describes Pharaoh's daughter as captivated by the size and beauty of the child, and as speaking of him to Pharaoh as of Divine beauty.

Josephus makes Thermeutis speak of him as \"of a noble understanding;\" and says that he was \"brought up with much care and diligence.\" And Philo, in his life of Moses(quoted by Whitby), says he was smiled in music, geometry, arithmetic, and hieroglyphics, and the whole circle of arts and sciences.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Well-nigh for full, A.V.

Rabb.), both quoted by Lightfoot ('Comment. and Exercitations upon the Acts'). The sum total of the three periods of forty years is given as the length of Moses' life, viz. a hundred and twenty years (Deuteronomy 34:7).

Loose the shoes, etc. In Exodus 3:5 it is λύσαι... ἐκ τῶν ποδῶν σου. Iamblichus, quoted by Meyer, refers the Pythagorean precept, \"Sacrifice and worship with thy shoes off,\" to an Egyptian custom. The custom of Orientals to take off their sandals on entering mosques or other sacred places, as existing to the present day, is noticed by many travelers (see also Joshua 5:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them.

(σὺν for ἐν), but giving no clear sense in English. The meaning seems to be that Moses was to rule and save with the strength given him by the angel But it is much simpler to take ἐν χειρὶ as equivalent to the common Hebrew phrase בְיָד, meaning instrumentality, \"by means of,\" \"through,\" and to join it with \"did send.\" The angel who spake to Moses in the bush in the Name of God was God's instrument in sending Moses. When an angel gives a message from God, the words are always given as spoken by God himself (see e.g. Joshua 2:1-3). In this verse Stephen, having with great oratorical skill entranced their attention by his recital of God's marvelous revelation of himself to Moses, now takes them off their guard, and shews how their fathers treated Moses just as they had treated Jesus Christ; and how God in the case of Moses had chosen and magnified the very man whom they had scornfully rejected; just as now he had exalted Jesus Christ to be a Prince and a Savior, whom they had crucified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - This man for he, A.V.; led them forth for brought them out, A.V. ; having wrought for after that he had showed, A.V. ; Egypt for the land of Egypt, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - God for the Lord your God, A.V. and T.R.; from among for of, A.V. The R.T. omits the words him shall ye hear, which follow in Dent. 18:15, and seem to be referred to in Matthew 17:5 (αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε αὐτοῦ ἀκούετε). The addition of the words adds much to the point of Stephen's application (see above, Acts 3:22).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Sinai for Sins, A.V. (Hebrew for Greek form); living cracks for the lively cracks, A.V. In the church. St. Stephen probably used the word ἐκκλησία without any reference to its special meaning, \"the Church.\" It is used in a secular sense in Acts 19:32, 39, and of the congregation of Israel in the LXX. of 1 Chronicles 13:2; 1 Macc. 2:56; Ecclus. 44:15; and elsewhere. In Stephen's time it could hardly have become widely known as the designation of the flock of Christ. On the whole, the marginal rendering, \"the congregation,\" seems best, but with the idea attached that it was the Lord's congregation. The angel which spake. It may be doubted whether the phrase, \"the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai,\" refers to the angel spoken of in ver. 30, or to the angel by whose mouth God spake the words of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, as recorded in Exodus 20:1-17; Deuteronomy 5:1-22. Chrysostom and most commentators seem to understand it of the angel who gave the Law; but Whitby, not without reason, thinks the reference is to the burning bush. Living oracles. In like manner, St. Paul calls the Holy Scriptures \"the oracles of God\" (Romans 3:2), and in Hebrews 5:12 we read again of \"the first principles of the oracles of God,\" and St. Peter says, \"Let him speak as the oracles of God\" (1 Peter 4:11). For the force of the living or lively oracles, see 1 Peter 1:23, 25. Stephen magnifies Moses by reminding his hearers how he had received the Law from God to give to the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Obedient for obey, A.V.; turned back in their hearts unto Egypt for in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, A.V.

A.V. The passage which follows is nearly verbatim et literatim the LXX. of Amos 5:25, 27, except the well-known substitution of \"Babylon\" for \"Damascus\" in Amos. This, according to Lightfoot, with whom most commentators agree, was in accordance with a very common practice of readers in the schools and pulpits of the Jews, to adapt and accommodate a text to their own immediate purpose, keeping, however, to historical truth. Here Stephen points to the Babylonish Captivity as the punishment of the sins of their fathers, thus warning them of more terrible judgments to follow their rejection of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - And for yea, A.V.; the god Rephan for your god Remphan, A.V. and T.R.; the figures for figures, A.V. The god Rephan. Rephan, or Raiphan, or Remphan, as it is variously written, is the LXX. translation of the Hebrew Chiun in Amos 5:26. The best explanation of this is that Rephan is the Coptic name of the planet Saturn, well-known of course to the LXX., and that Chiun is the Hebrew and Arabic name of the same star, which they therefore translated by Rephan. With regard to the difficulty which has been felt by many that there is no mention of any such worship of Moloch and Chiun in the wilderness, and that sacrifices were continually offered to the Lord, it seems to arise from an entire misconception of the passage in Amos. What Amos means to say is that because of the treacherous, unfaithful heart of Israel, as shown in the worship of the golden calf and all their rebellions in the wilderness, all their sacrifices were worthless. Just as he had said in Amos 5:22, \"Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts;\" \"I hate, I despise your feast days; Take away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols\" (Amos 5:21, 23): just as Isaiah also says, \"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?... I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts ... Bring no more vain oblations; ... it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting\" (Isaiah 1:11-13, etc.); and again, \"He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood\" (Isaiah 66:3): so all the sacrifices offered up during forty years in the wilderness were no sacrifices at all, and their hypocrisy was clearly seen when they reached the land of Canaan, and, according to Moses' prophetic declaration, \"forsook God which made them... aria sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not\" (Deuteronomy 32:15-18), such as Chiun and Moloch, Baalim and Ashtoreth. This later idolatry was the fruit and the judicial punishment of their first declension and apostasy in the wilderness, and led to the Captivity in Babylon. It was on seeing their unfaithfulness in the wilderness that\" God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOur fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 44. - The testimony for witness, A.V.; even as he appointed who spake for as he had appointed, speaking, A.V.; figure for fashion, A.V. Chrysostom calls attention to the mention of the wilderness, as showing that God's presence and service were not confined to Jerusalem.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - In their turn for that come after, (διαδεξάμενοι), A.V.; Joshua (the Hebrew form) for Jesus (the Greek form of the name), A.V.; when they entered on the possession of the nations for into the possession of the Gentiles, A.V.; which God thrust for whom God drave, A.V. In their turn; more literally, having received it in succession. It only occurs here in the New Testament. Meyer quotes 4 Macc. 4:15, \"On the death of Seleucus, his son Antiochus received the kingdom in succession ;\" and classical writers. When they entered, etc. There are three ways of construing the words ἐν τῇ κατασχέσει τῶν ἐθνῶν -NEWLINENEWLINE(1) as the A.V., taking ἐν in the sense of εἰς, and making the phrase synonymous with the laud of Canaan, the land which the Gentiles then possessed;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) in (their) taking possession (of the land) of the Gentiles, i.e. when they took, taking κατάσχεσις in a transitive sense, which seems to be the sense of the R.V.:NEWLINENEWLINE(3) with Meyer, during the holdings or possession by the Gentiles of the land, that, viz. into which their fathers brought the tabernacle. The first seems the most simple and in accordance with the Greek of the New Testament, and with what follows of the expulsion of the nations before the Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - In the sight of for before, A.V. (ἐνώπιον); asked for desired, A.V.; habitation for tabernacle, A.V. (σκήνωμα). Habitation. In Deuteronomy 33:18 σκήνωμα stands in the LXX. for אִהֶל, and in 2 Peter 1:13, 5:14, for the human body as the tabernacle or temporary dwelling of the soul or spirit. And the idea of a temporary or movable dwelling seems to suit Stephen's argument better than that of a fixed one. The מִשְׁכָנות of Psalm 132:5 (to which perhaps, as well as 2 Samuel 7:1-6, Stephen refers) is equally applicable to a tent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Solomon built him an house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 47. - A house for an house, A.V. The οϊκος (the house) of ver. 47, which Solomon built, seems to be almost in contrast with the σκήνωμα (the tabernacle).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 48. - Houses (in italics) for temples, A.V. and T.R. The word ναοῖς (here, but not in Acts 17:24) is omitted in the R.T. In Isaiah 16:12. LXX. (quoted by Meyer), χειροποίητα (plural) is used without a substantive for the \"sanctuary\" (מִקְדּושׁ) of Moab. For the sentiment that the infinite God, Creator of heaven and earth, cannot be contained in a house built by the hands of men, see also 2 Chronicles 6:18, as well as the passages above quoted. Stephen justifies himself from the charge of having spoken blasphemous words against the temple by citing Isaiah 66:1.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHeaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 49. - The heaven for heaven, A.V.; the earth the footstool of my feet for earth is my footstool, A.V.; what manner of house for what house, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHath not my hand made all these things?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - Did not my hand make for hath not my hand made, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 51. - Stiff-necked; hard of neck, inflexible. The word σκληροτράχηλος only occurs here in the New Testament. But it answers in the LXX. to the Hebrew קְשֵׁה־עֹרֶף (hard of neck); see Exodus 33:3, 5, and elsewhere. In applying this expression to his hearers, Stephen was using the identical language of Moses when he conveyed God's rebuke to them. Considering that they professed to be standing on Moses' side against Stephen, this must have made his words doubly cutting to them. Uncircumcised in heart; ἀπερίτμητος only occurs here in the New Testament, but it is found in 2 Macc. 1:51 2Macc. 2:46; and in the LXX. of Exodus 12:48; Judges 14:3; 1 Samuel 17:26, and elsewhere for the Hebrew עֹרֵל. The word, in its application to his Jewish audience, contains a whole volume of rebuke. They prided themselves on their circumcision, they trusted in it as a sure ground of favor in the sight of God; but all the while they were on a level with the heathen whom they despised, and were to be reckoned among the uncircumcised whom they loathed. For they were without the true circumcision, that of the heart. Here again Stephen was teaching in the exact spirit and even words of Moses and the prophets. See Leviticus 26:41; Deuteronomy 10:16 (where Stephen's two reproaches occur together); Jeremiah 9:26; Ezekiel 44:7; and many other passages. Compare the teaching of St. Paul (Romans 2:28, 29; Philippians 3:2, 3; Colossians 2:11; and elsewhere).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 52. - Did not... persecute for have not... persecuted, A.V.; killed for have slain, A.V. ; righteous for just, A.V.; have now become for have been now, A.V.; betrayers for the betrayers, A.V. The close resemblance of Stephen's words to those of our Lord recorded in Luke 13:33, 34; Matthew 5:12; Matthew 23:30, 31, 34-37, lend some support to the tradition that he was one of the seventy, and had heard the Lord speak them. But the resemblance may have arisen from the Spirit by which he spake, \"the Spirit of Christ which was in\" him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 53. - Ye who received for who have received, A.V. ; as it was ordained by angels for by the disposition of angels, A.V.; kept it not for hove not kept it, A.V. Ordained by angels. This phrase, thus differently rendered (εἰς διαταγὰς ἀγγέλων), is one of extreme difficulty: διαταγή means properly appointment,\" or \"ordinance,\" as in Romans 13:2; and εἰς, which has a great variety of uses in the Greek of the New Testament, means \"at,\" or \"upon,\" or \"on the occasion of,\" as Matthew 12:41, \"At the preaching of Jonah.\" So here they received the Law \"at\" or \"on the occasion of,\" the \"ordering\" or \"appointing\" of angels. When the angels, who were commissioned by God and spoke in his Name, gave the Law, the Israelites so received it. The A.V., \"by the disposition of angels\" very nearly ex- presses the true sense. Another sense of εἰς - \"in view of\" - comes to nearly the same thing. St. Paul speaks of the part taken by the angels in the giving of the Law, and in language strikingly resembling the text. He says of it, that it was \"ordained through ['by,' A V] angels\" God ordained or appointed the Law, but the angels were the instruments or ministers of its promulgation. And it is also distinctly referred to in Deuteronomy 33:2, where the LXX. read, \"On his right hand the angels were with him.\" In the foregoing verses the application which Stephen had all through been contemplating is hurled with accumulated force at the consciences of his hearers, and cuts them to the heart, but does not bring them to repentance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 54. - Now when for when, A.V. They were cut to the heart (see Acts 5:33 and notes).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 55. - Looked up steadfastly (ἀτενίσας); see Acts 6:15; Acts 3:4, and note. The glory of God; i.e. the visible glory which surrounds and proclaims God's near presence (see Exodus 24:10, 16, 17; Isaiah 6:1-3; Ezekiel 1:28; Revelation 21:14, 23, etc.). Jesus standing. Sitting at the right hand of God is the usual attitude ascribed to our Lord in token of his victorious rest, and waiting for the day of judgment. Here he is seen standing, as rising to welcome his faithful martyr, and to place on his head the crown of life Revelation 2:10). Whether Stephen saw these glorious things in the flesh or out of the flesh he probably knew not himself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - The Son of man. Our Lord's usual designation of himself (see Matthew 8:10; Matthew 26:64; etc.; and also Daniel 7:13), but nowhere but here spoken of Jesus by any other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - But for then, A.V.; rushed for ran, A.V.

They cast. We have here the identical phrase of Luke 4:29. The witness. According to Deuteronomy 17:7, \"the hands of the witnesses were to be first upon\" the idolater \"to put him to death.\" They took off their clothes, their outer garments, so as to be free to hurl the stones at their victim with greater force. The feet of a young man. The word νεανίας is found only here and in Acts 20:9; Acts 23:17, 18, 22; and frequently in the LXX. for the Hebrew נַעִר. A man might be called a νεανίας probably to the age of thirty. This appearance of Saul upon the stage of St. Luke's narrative is an element which will soon change the whole current of the narrative, and divert it from Jerusalem to the whole earth. Nothing can be more striking than this introduction of the young man Saul to our view as an accomplice (albeit \"ignorantly in unbelief\") in the martyrdom of Stephen. Who that stood there and saw him keeping the clothes of the witnesses would have imagined that he would become the foremost apostle of the faith which he sought to destroy from off the face of the earth?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 59. - The Lord (in italics) for God (in italics), A.V. The A.V. is certainly not justified by the context, because the words which follow, \"Lord Jesus,\" show to whom the invocation was made, even to him whom he saw standing at the right hand of God. At the same time, the request, Receive my spirit, was a striking acknowledgment of the divinity of Christ. Only he who gave the spirit could receive it back again, and keep it safe unto the resurrection. Compare \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit\" (Luke 23:46).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs7:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

Compare again Luke 23:46, and with Stephen's prayer, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge, compare Luke 23:34. He fell asleep. Blessed rest after life's toilsome day! Blessed contrast with the tumult of passion and violence which brought him down to the grave! How near, too, in his dying was that likeness to his Lord advanced, which shall be perfected at his appearing (1 John 3:1)! \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,... that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.\" St. Augustine ('Sermons in Festo Sti. Stephani;' Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1. p. 82) attributes Saul's conversion to the prayer of Stephen: \"Si Stephanus non orasset, Ecclesia Paulum non haberet.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Saul was consenting unto his death.

Devout men; ἀνδρες αὐλαβεῖς. This word is applied to Simeon (Luke 2:25), and to the Jews who were assembled at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:5), and, according to the R.T., to Ananias (Acts 22:12); but occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It is not certain, therefore, that these men were Christians, though they might be. If not, they were pious Jews, men who feared God, and still loved Stephen as being himself a devout Jew though he was a disciple. Buried. Συγκομίζω occurs only here in the New Testament; but its common use for carrying corn to a barn or granary seems to indicate that \"carrying to his burial\" of the A.V. is the most exact rendering. The word is said also to be applied to the acts preparatory to burial - closing the eyes, washing, anointing the body, and so on; but this meaning is less certain than that of \"carrying.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - But for as for, A.V.; 'laid waste for he made havoc of,' A.V. From the dispersion of the disciples will flow the narrative in this present chapter. It is therefore mentioned first. From the persecution of Saul will flow the narrative in Acts 9 and to the end of the book.

Went about; i.e. from place to place, and wherever they went they preached the Word. Διέρχομαι here is used in the same sense as in ver. 40, and in Acts 10:38; Acts 17:23; Acts 20:25, and elsewhere.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And for then, A.V. ; proclaimed unto them the Christ for preached Christ unto them, A.V. Philip; the deacon and evangelist (Acts 6:7; Acts 21:8), not the apostle. As regards Samaria, it is always used in the New Testament of the country, not of the city, which at this time was called Sebaste, from Σεβαστός, i.e. Augustus Caesar (see Acts 25:21, 26, etc.; John 4:5; and Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 7:9). Whether, therefore, we read with the T.R. πόλιν, or with the R.T. τὴν πόλιν, we must understand Samaria to mean the country, and probably the city to be the capital, Sebaste. Alford, however, with many others, thinks that Sychem is meant, as in John 4:5.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The multitudes gave heed with one accord for the people with one accord gave heed, A.V.; the for those (things), A.V. that were spoken by Philip for which -Philip spake, A.V.; when they heard and saw the signs for hearing and seeing the miracles, A.V.

From many of those, etc. The R.T. is represented by the margin, but it is nonsense. The different rendering depends upon whether πνεύματα ἀκάθατα is taken as the subject to ἐξήρχετο, or as the object after ἔχοντα. In one case, πνεύματα or αὐτά must be understood after ἐχόντων, as in the A.V., which inserts with them in italics; in the other, the same word must be understood before ἐξήρχετο, as in the R.V., which inserts they. The latter construction seems right, but the sense is the same, and the A.V. is much the nearest rendering. That were palsied. The purpose and effect of miracles is here clearly shown, to attract attention, and to evidence to the hearers and seers that the workers of miracles are God's messengers, and that the Word which they preach is God's Word.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was great joy in that city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Much for great, A.V. and T.R. Much joy. The joy was caused partly by the healing of their sick, and partly by the glad tidings of the gospel of peace (comp. Matthew 13:20; 1 Peter 1:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Simon by name for called Simon, A.V.; the city for the same city, A.V.; amazed for bewitched, A.V. (here and in ver. 13). Amazed. In Luke 24:22 the same word (ἐξίστημι) is rendered \"made us astonished\" in the A.V.; and in Acts 2:7, 12, and elsewhere, in an intransitive sense, \"were amazed.\" It has also the meaning of \"being out of one's mind,\" or \"beside one's self\" (Mark 3:21; 2 Corinthians 5:13), but never that of \"bewitching\" or \"being bewitched.\" As regards Simon, commonly surnamed Magus, from his magic arts, it is doubtful whether he is the same Simon as is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,'20. 7:2) as being employed by Felix the Procurator of Judaea, in the reign of Claudius (Acts 23:25), to bewitch Drusfila into forsaking her husband, King Azizus, and marrying him, which she did (Acts 24:24). The doubt arises from Josephus stating that Simon to be a Cypriot (Κύπριον γένος), whereas Justin Martyr says of Simon Magus that he was ἀπὸ κώμης λεγομένης Γίττων, a native of Gitton, or Githon, a village of Samaria. It has been thought that Gitton may be a mistake of Justin's for Citium, in Cyprus (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 260, 352; Alford, etc.). The after history of Simon Magus is full of fable. He is spoken of by Irenaeus and other early writers as the inventor or founder of heresy. (For a list of authorities concerning Simon, see Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 260, note; Alford, 1:6; 'Bible Dictionary; 'and a good article in 'Dict. of Biog. and Mythol.')NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - That power of God which is called Great for the great power of God, A.V. and T.R. That power of God, etc. The revised text inserts καλουμένη before μεγάλη. Origen says of Simon that his disciples, the Simoniaus, called him \"The Power of God.\" ('Contra Cels.,' lib. 5:62, where see Delarue's note). According to Tertullian ('De Anima'), he gave himself out as the supreme Father, with other blasphemies. According to St. Jerome on Matthew 24:5, he speaks of himself in different writings as the Word of God, as the Paraclete, the Almighty, the Fullness of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They gave heed to him for to him they had regard, A.V.; amazed for bewitched, A.V.; his sorceries for sorceries, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Good tidings for the things, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And for then, A.V.; also himself believed for himself believed also, A.V.; being baptized for when he was baptized, A.V.; beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed for wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. Contained with (η}ν προσκαρτερῶν); see Acts 1:14; 3:46; 6:4; 10.7. St. Paul uses the word in Romans 12:12; Romans 13:6; Colossians 4:2; and the substantive formed from it (προσκαρτέρησις) once, Ephesians 6:18. Elsewhere in the New Testament it occurs only in Mark 3:9. But it is found in Hist. cf. Sus. 6. Amazed (see note on ver. 9). In Simon we have the first example of one who, having been baptized into Jesus Christ, lived to disgrace and corrupt the faith which he professed. He was an instance of the tares sown among the wheat, and of the seed which sprang up quickly being as quickly destroyed. He is an instance also of the truth of our Lord's raying, \"Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The apostles (see ver. 1). They sent unto them Peter and John. The selection of these two chief apostles shows the great importance attached to the conversion of the Samaritans. The joint act of the college of apostles in sending them demonstrates that Peter was not a pope, but a brother apostle, albeit their primate; and that the government of the Church was in the apostolate, not in one of the number.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - That they might receive the Holy Ghost. Why was it needful that two apostles should come down to Samaria and pray, with laying on of hands, for the newly baptized that they might receive the Holy Ghost? There is no mention of such prayer or such imposition of hands in the case of the first three thousand who were baptized. They were told by St. Peter, \"Be baptized every one of you, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost\" (Acts 2:38), and they were baptized, and doubtless did receive the Holy Ghost, Neither is there any mention of such things in the case of the subsequent thousands who were baptized at Jerusalem on the apostles' preaching. Why, then, was it so in Samaria? To answer this question, we must observe the difference in the circumstances. The baptisms at Jerusalem were performed by the apostles themselves. The Holy Ghost was given upon their promise and assurance. But in Samaria the preaching and the baptizing were done by the scattered disciples. There was a danger of many independent bodies springing up, owing no allegiance to the apostles, and cemented by no bonds to the mother Church. But Christ's Church was to be one - many members, but one body. The apostolate was to be the governing power of the whole Church, by the will and ordinance of Christ. Hence there was a manifest reason why, when the gospel spread beyond Judaea, these visible spiritual gifts should be given only through the laying on of the apostles' hands, and by the intervention of their prayers. This had a manifest and striking influence in marking and preserving the unity of the Church, and in marking and maintaining the sovereignty of the apostolic rule. For precisely the same reason has the Catholic and Apostolic Church in all ages (Acts 19:5, 6; Hebrews 6:2) maintained the rite of confirmation, \"after the example of the holy apostles.\" Besides the other great benefits connected with it, its influence in binding up in the unity of the Church the numerous parishes of the diocese, instead of letting them become independent congregations, is very great. Observe, too, how prayer and the laying on of hands are tied together. Neither is valid without the other. In this case, as at Pentecost, the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred. In confirmation, now that miracles have ceased, it is the ordinary and invisible grace of the Holy Spirit that is to be looked for.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Had been for were, A.V.; into for in, A.V. Into the name. In seems preferable (comp. Matthew 10:41, 42). The use of the prepositions in the New Testament is much influenced by the Hebrew, through the language of the LXX. As regards baptism in the Name of the Lord Jesus, here and ver. 39, T.R.; Acts 10:48; Acts 19:5, we are not to suppose that any other formula was used than that prescribed by our Lord (Matthew 28:19). But as baptism was preceded by a confession of faith similar to that in our own Baptismal Service, so it was a true description to speak of baptism as being in the Name of Jesus Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Now for and, A.V.; the laying for laying, A.V.

Would to God that spiritual powers in the Church had never been prostituted to base purposes of worldly gain, and that all the servants of Christ had shown themselves as superior to \"filthy lucre\" as Peter and Elisha were!

(rightly, κτᾶσθαι is the middle voice). Silver. This is a change of very doubtful necessity; ἀργύριον, like the French argent, is frequently used for \"money\" generally, without any reference to the particular metal of which it is made. Sometimes, indeed, it is used in opposition to \"gold,\" as Acts 3:6 and Acts 20:33, and then it is properly rendered \"silver.\" Here the Revisers' mason, doubtless, was to reserve \"money\" as the rendering of χρήματα (vers. 19, 20). St. Peter's answer is remarkable, not only for the warmth with which he repudiates the proffered bribe, but also for the jealous humility with which he affirms that the gifts of the Spirit were not his to give, but were the gift of God (see Acts 3:12-16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Before God for in the sight of God, A.V. Thou hast neither part nor lot. The \"covetous shall not inherit the kingdom of God\" (1 Corinthians 6:10; comp. Psalm 10:3; Luke 16:14; 1 Timothy 3:3). The phrase, ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ, rendered in this matter, seems to be more fitly rendered in the margin, \"in this Word,\" i.e. the Word of life, the Word of salvation, which we preach (see Acts 5:20; Acts 10:36; Acts 13:26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRepent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Lord for God, A.V. and T.R.; thy for thine, A.V.; shall for may, A.V. Repent. The terrible words, \"Thy money perish with thee,\" had not expressed Peter's wish for his destruction. But they were the wounds of a friend speaking sharp things to pierce, if possible, a callous conscience. In the hope that that conscience had been pierced, he now urges repentance. And yet still, dealing skilfully with so bad a case, he speaks of the forgiveness doubtfully, \"if perhaps.\" The sin was a very grievous one; the wound must not be healed too hastily. \"There is a sin unto death.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - See for perceive, A.V. In the gall of bitterness, etc. The passage from which both this expression and the similar one in Hebrews 12:15 are taken is manifestly Deuteronomy 29:18, where the Greek of the LXX. has, ῤίζα ἄνω φύουσα ἐν χολῇ καὶ πικρίᾳ. The context there also shows conclusively that the \"gall and bitterness\" (\"wormwood,\" A.V.) of which Moses speaks is the spirit of idolatry or defection from God springing up in some professing member of the Church, and defiling and corrupting others, as it is expounded in Hebrews 12:15, 16. This, as St. Peter saw, was exactly the case with Simon, whose heart was not straight with God, but \"had turned away from him,\" as it is said in Deuteronomy. Though baptized, he was still an idolater in heart, and likely to trouble many. \"The gall of bitterness\" is the same as \"gall and wormwood,\" or \"bitterness.\" \"Gall,\" or \"bile,\" is in classical Greek and other languages a synonym for \"bitterness,\" especially in a figurative sense (see Lamentations 3:15, 19 - πικρία καὶ χολή, LXX.). The uncommon phrase, the bond of iniquity, seems to be borrowed from Isaiah 58:6, where the LXX. have the same words, λύε πὰντα σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας, \"loose the bands of wickedness,\" A.V. Simon was still bound in these bands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - And Simon answered for then answered Simon, A.V.; .for me to the Lord for to the Lord for me, A.V.; the for these, A.V. Pray ye, etc.; addressed to both Peter and John, who were acting together, and whose prayers had been seen to be effectual (ver. 15) in procuring the gift of the Holy Ghost. In like manner, Pharaoh, under the influence of terror at God's judgments, had asked again and again for the prayers of Moses and Aaron (Exodus 8:8, 28; Exodus 9:27, 28; Exodus 10:16, 17, etc.). But in neither ease was this an evidence of true conversion of heart.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - They therefore for and they, A.V. ; spoken for preached, A.V.; to many for in many, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - But an angel for and the angel, A.V.; the same is for which is, A.V. An angel. \"The angel,\" as in A.V., is right, just as ὄνομα Κυρίου (Matthew 21:9; Matthew 23:39; Luke 19:38, etc.) and שֵׁם יְהוָה in Hebrew mean \"the Name of the Lord,\" not \"a Name\" (see Acts 5:19; Acts 7:31, notes). The south, meaning that part of Judaea which was called \"the south country ;\" Hebrew הַנֶּגֶב (Genesis 20:1; Genesis 24:62; etc.). This is generally rendered in the LXX. by πρὸς λίβα or πρὸς νότον. But in 1 Samuel 20:41, in Symraachus, μεσηνβρία stands as the rendering of חַנֶּגֶב. As regards the words, the same is desert, it is observable that in Numbers 31:1 and Deuteronomy 34:3 ἔρημος is the LXX. rendering of חַנֶבֶם, and that part of the country is called \"the wilderness of Judaea.\" The words of the angel, therefore, mean, not that Gaza is desert, nor that the read itself is desert, but that the country to which he was directing Philip's journey was part of that known as the desert; αὕτη does not refer to ὁδός or to Γάζα, but to χώρα, understood as contained in ἔρημος. The meaning of the whole sentence I take to be as follows: - \"Take thy journey in [or, 'by'] the south [comp. Luke 15:14; Acts 5:15; Acts 11:1; Acts 13. lids far as [ἐπί, 'notans locum vel terminum ad quem' (Schleusner)] the road that goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, where the country is desert.\" Philip was to proceed from Samaria along the south country till he came to where the Jerusalem road met his road. That district, he is reminded, was desert, part, i.e., or the desert of Judaea. The spot was probably selected for that very reason, as affording the privacy necessary for the eunuch to read in his chariot, and for Philip to join him and expound the Word of God to him. Chrysostom (followed by others) takes κατὰ μεσημβρίαν in the sense of \"at noonday in the most violent heat,\" though he also renders it \"southwards\" (Hem., 19.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Was over for had the charge of, A.V. ; who for and, A.V. Candace. According to Pithy, the queens of Ethiopia, who reigned at Meroc, were so named through a long course of years ('Nat. Hist.,' 6:2,5-37). Dion Cassius speaks of a warlike Queen of Ethiopia of that name, who was brought to terms by Caius Petronius in the year A.U.C. 732 (54:5, 4). Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' lib. it. cap. 1.) says that the custom still continued in his day of the Ethiopians being governed by a queen. Had come to Jerusalem, etc. He was doubtless a proselyte of the gate. Eusebius, in the place above cited, speaks of him as the first Gentile convert, and as the first fruits of the faithful in the whole world. He adds, as Irenaeus before him had hinted (3. 12:8), that he is reported to have preached the gospel to the Ethiopians, by which the prophecy of Psalm 68:31 was fulfilled. Later traditions speak of Candace as baptized by him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWas returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - And he was for was, A.V. ; was reading for read, A.V.; Isaiah for Esaias, A.V., the Hebrew for the Greek form. The diffusion of the Holy Scriptures among the Gentiles by means of the Jewish dispersion and the facility given to Gentiles for reading the Scriptures by their translation into Greek at Alexandria, and by the universal use of the Greek language through the conquests of Alexander the Great, are striking instances of the providence of God working all things after the counsel of his own will.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - And for then, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Ran for ran thither, A.V.; reading-Isaiah the prophet for read the prophet Esaias, A.V. and T.R. Heard him. He was reading aloud. In Hebrew, the word for \"to read\" (קָרָא) means \"to call,\" \"to proclaim aloud.\" Hence the keri, that which is read, as distinguished from the cethib, that which is written. Reading Isaiah the prophet. The same providence which sent Philip to meet him in the desert doubtless directed his reading to the fifty-third chapter of the great evangelical prophet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?

He besought, etc. Tim humility and thirst for instruction of this great courtier are very remarkable, and the instance of the joint use of the written Word and the living teacher is noteworthy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Now the place for the place, A.V.; was reading for read, A.V.; as a lamb... is dumb for like a lamb dumb, A.V.; he openeth not for opened he not, A.V. As a lamb... is dumb. The A.V. of this clause seems to me preferable as a rendering of the Greek, though the Hebrew has נֶאֶלָמָה, \"is dumb.\" But this may be rendered \"which is dumb.\" As regards the word περιοχή, rendered place, and considered as the antecedent to which, the use of it by Cicero ('Ad Attic.,' 13:25) for a whole paragraph, and the employment in the Syriac Version of this passage of the technical word which denotes a \"section\" or \"paragraph,\" and the Vulgate rendering, Locus... quem (Schleusner), as well as the etymology of the word, which means \"a circuit,\" or \"circumference,\" within which something is contained - all strongly point to the rendering in the text. Meyer, however, and others make τῆς γραφῆς the antecedent to ἥν, and construe, \"The contents of the Scripture which he was reading,\" and refer to 1 Peter 2:6.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - His generation who shall declare? for and who shall declare his generation? A.V. and T.R. The preceding quotation is taken verbatim from the LXX., which, however, varies somewhat from the Hebrew. In this verse, for the Hebrew as rendered in the A.V., \"He was taken from prison and from judgment,\" the LXX. has, \"In his humiliation his judgment was taken away,\" having evidently read in their copy מֵעֹצְרו מִשְׁפָטו, or perhaps בְעצְרו, \"Through [or, 'in'] his oppression [humiliation] his judgment was taken away.\" Mr. Cheyne translates the Hebrew, \"Through oppression and through a judgment [sentence] he was taken \"away [to death].\" For the Hebrew of the A.V., \"He was cut off out of the land of the living,\" the LXX. has, \"His life is taken from the earth,\" where they must have read חַיו, \"his life,\" as the subject of the verb, instead of חַיִּים, the living, taken in construction with אֶרֶץ , the earth. The differences, however, are not material in regard to the general meaning of the passage. His generation who shall declare? The explanation of this difficult expression belongs tea commentary on Isaiah. Here it must suffice to say that the explanation most in accordance with the meaning of the Hebrew words (יְשׂחֵחַ and דורו), with the context, and with the turn of thought in Isaiah 38:10-12 and Jeremiah 11:19, is that given in the 'Speaker's Commentary:' \"Who will consider, give serious thought to, his life or age, seeing it is so prematurely cut off?\" which is merely another way of saying that Messiah should \"be cut off\" (Daniel 9:26)\" from the land of the living, that his Name be no more remembered\" (Jeremiah, as above). It was the frustration of this hope of Jesus being forgotten in consequence of his death that so troubled the Sanhedrim (Acts 5:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Other for other man, A.V.

Here is water. \"When we were at Tell-el-Hasy, and saw the water standing along the bottom of the adjacent wady, we could not but remark the coincidence of several circumstances with the account of the eunuch's baptism. This water is on the most direct road from Belt Jibrin (Eleutheroplis) to Gaza, on the most southern road from Jerusalem, and in the midst of a country now 'desert,' i.e. without villages or fixed habitations. There is no other similar water on this road\" (Robinson,' Bibl. Res.,' vol. it. p. 345). There were three roads from Jerusalem to Gaza, of which the one above described still exists, \"and actually passes through the desert\" (ibid. p. 514). What doth hinder me to be baptized! This question clearly shows that the doctrine of baptism had formed part of Philip's preaching, as it had of Peter (Acts 2:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The whole of ver. 37 of the A.V. is omitted in the R.T., on the authority of the best existing manuscripts. But on the other hand, Irenaeus, in the third book against Heresies, Acts 12:8, distinctly quotes a portion of this verse. The eunuch, he says, when he asked to be baptized said, Πιστεύω τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἴναι τὸν Ιησοῦν Ξριστόν: and Cyprian, in his third book of Testimonies, 43, quotes the other part of the verse. In proof of the thesis that \"whoever believes may be immediately baptized,\" he says, \"In the Acts of the Apostles [when the eunuch said], Behold water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? Philip answered, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.\" So that in the second and third centuries, long anterior to the oldest existing manuscripts, this entire verse must have been found in the codices both of the Greek and Latin Churches.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Both went down for went down both, A.V. Nothing can be more graphic than the simple narrative of this interesting and important baptism. Surely Luke must have heard it from Philip's own mouth (see Acts 21:8-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Came up for were come up, A.V.; and the eunuch for that the eunuch, A.V.; for he went for and he went, A.V. The eunuch made no attempt to follow Philip, but went on his road to Egypt, his whole heart filled with the new joy of Christ's salvation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs8:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - He preached the gospel to all the cities for he preached in all the cities, A.V. The sudden rapture of Philip by the Spirit, and his transportation to Azotus, or Ashdod, reminds us forcibly of 1 Kings 18:12, and of the successive journeys of Elijah just prior to his translation. In Philip's case we may suppose a kind of trance, which was not ended till he found himself at Azotus. Passing through. For διέρχομαι (there rendered \"went about\"), see ver. 4, note. To Caesarea; where we find him domiciled (Acts 21:8). Such coincidences, appearing in the narrative without any explanation, are strong marks of truth. \"He journeyed northward from Ashdod, perhaps through Ekron, Ramah, Joppa, and the plain of Sharon\" (Meyer).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Acts.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - But for and, A.V.; breathing for breathing out, A.V.; threatening for threatenings, A.V. Threatening and slaughter. The phrase ἐμπνέων ἀπειλῆς κ.τ.λ., is rather a difficult one, and is variously explained. Schleusner takes the genitives in \"threatening and slaughter\" as genitives of the thing desired, \"punting after threatening and slaughter\" (comp. Amos 2:7). Meyer explains it \"out of the threatenings and murder [in his heart] breathing hard at the disciples\" - an expression indicating passion. Alford, taking nearly the sense of the A.V., makes \"threatenings and slaughter\" to be as it were the very material of his breath, whether breathed out or breathed in. Considering that ἐμπνέω means \"to breathe in,\" as distinguished from ἐκπνέω, \"to breathe out,\" and that these two are opposed to each other in Hippocrates (see Schleusner), the A.V. breathing out cannot be justified; nor is it likely that \"Luke the physician\" would forget the distinction. The difficulty is to explain the genitive case of \"threatenings\" and \"slaughter.\" The high priest; probably the same person who is so described in Acts 7:1 (where see note). If the year with which we are now dealing was the year A.D. , Caiaphas was high priest. But Alford, Lewin, Farrar, and others place Saul's conversion in A.D. , when Theophilus, son of Annas or Ananus, was high priest (Chronicles Table in Alford's 'Proleg. to Acts').NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Asked for desired, A.V.; unto for to, A.V.; any that were of the Way for any of this way, A.V.; whether men, etc., for whether they were men, etc., A.V.; to for unto, A.V. To Damascus. No special reason is given why Damascus is singled out. But it is clear from vers. 10 and 13 that there was already a considerable number of Christian Jews at Damascus. And this, with the fact of there being a great multitude of Jews settled there, was a sufficient reason why Saul should ask for letters to each of the synagogues at Damascus, directing them to send any Christians who might be found amongst them bound to Jerusalem to be tried there before the Sanhedrim. There may have been thirty or forty synagogues at Damascus, and not less than forty thousand resident Jews. Of the Way; i.e. holding the doctrine of Christ. Thus in Acts 18:25, 26, the Christian faith is spoken of as \"the way of the Lord\" and \"the way of God.\" In Acts 19:9, 23; Acts 22:4; Acts 24:14, was the term by which the faith of Christ was spoken of chiefly, perhaps, among the Jews. The term means a peculiar doctrine or sect. Its application to Christians apparently lasted only so long as Christianity was considered to be a modification or peculiar form of Judaism, and its frequent use in the Acts is therefore an evidence of the early composition of the book.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - It came to pass that he drew nigh unto for he came near, A.V.; shone for shined, A.V.; out of for from, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Fell upon, for fell to, A.V. Some, as Lord Lytlelton and Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 48), from the expressions, \"fell to the ground,\" \"fell to the earth,\" infer that Saul was \"himself mounted, and his followers some mounted and some on foot.\" And Farrar also, far other reasons, supposes that Saul and his companions rode horses or mules. The journey, he says, was nearly a hundred and fifty miles, and the roads rough, bad, and steep; and Saul was traveling as the legate or the high priest. Still it is strange that no one expression should point distinctly to the party being on horseback, which \"falling to the earth,\" or \"ground,\" certainly do not. While, on the other hand, the phrases, \"Arise,\" \"stood speechless,\" \"led him by the hand,\" seem rather to point to his being on foot. Lunge well compares the double invocation, Saul, Saul! with those similar ones, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" \"Samuel, Samuel!\" \"Jerusalem, Jerusalem!\" \"Simon, Simon!\" (Genesis 22:11; 1 Samuel 3:10; Matthew 23:27; Luke 22:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, Who art thou, Lord?

And the Lord said unto him,\" are omitted in the R.T. They have, in fact, no manuscript authority (Meyer; Alford); and not much patristic authority, or from versions, and are omitted by all modern editors. They seem to be taken from the parallel narratives in Acts 22:8-10; Acts 26:14. The proverb, \"It is hard,\" etc., is only found in Acts 26:14 (where see note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

Speechless; ἐννεοί (or rather ἐνεοί) is found nowhere else in the New Testament, but is not uncommon in the LXX. (e.g. Isaiah 56:10) and in classical Greek. Here it means speechless from terror, struck dumb. The description here given by St. Luke seems to be contradictory in two particulars to St. Paul's own account in Acts 22:9 and Acts 26:14. For St. Paul's companions are said here to have \"stood speechless;\" but in Acts 26:14 they were \"all fallen to the earth.\" Here they \"hear the voice,\" but in Acts 22:9 they \"heard not the voice of him that spake.\" It is obvious, however, that in such descriptions all depends upon the particular moment of the transaction described which happens to be uppermost in the mind of the speaker or writer at the time, and the particular purpose in relation to which he is giving the description. Thus at one moment the spectators might be standing dumfounded, and at the next they might be prostrate on the ground, or vice versa. Either description of their attitude would be a true one, though not true with regard to the same moment. Again, if the purpose of the speaker was to affirm that the whole company were conscious of both the vision and the sound of a voice speaking, but that only Saul saw the Divine Speaker, the description \"hearing the voice, but beholding no man\" would be the natural one. Whereas, if the purpose was to express that Saul alone heard the words spoken to him by the Lord, the description of his companions,\" They saw indeed the light... but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me,\" would be equally natural.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. Nothing for no man, A.V. and T.R.; and for but, A.V. Nothing (οὐδὲν for οὐδένα). So the best manuscripts and editions The idea is, not like that in Matthew 17:8 that when he opened his eyes the person seen in vision had disappeared, but simply that his eyesight was gone, \"for the glory of that light,\" and he could see nothing, but had to be led like a blind man (see Acts 22:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Did neither for neither did, A.V. The same reason, we may venture to think, which caused the interposition of three days' blindness between Saul's conversion and his baptism, led Saul himself to pass those days in a voluntary self-abasement. His sin in persecuting the Church of God and its Divine Head, his guilt in assisting at the death of God's saints, and in rejecting the testimony to Christ's resurrection, had been very great. These three days of blindness and of fasting were therefore a fitting preparation for the grace of forgiveness about to be so freely and fully given to him (1 Timothy 1:12-16). What thoughts must have passed through Saul's mind during those three days! Before passing on, it may be well to observe that it is to this appearance to him of Jesus Christ that St. Paul undoubtedly refers when he says (1 Corinthians 9:1), \"Have not I seen Jesus Christ?\" and again (1 Corinthians 15:8), \"Last of all, he was seen of me also,\" where he puts this appearance of Jesus to himself on a par with those to Peter and James and the other apostles, which made them competent witnesses of the resurrection of Christ. And so in ver. 17 of this chapter Ananias says, \"The Lord Jesus which was seen by thee\" (ὁ ὀφθείς σοι); and Barnabas (ver. 27), when he brought Saul to the apostles, related \"how he had seen the Lord in the way.\" And in Acts 22:14 Ananias says, \"God hath appointed thee to see the Righteous One.\" Moreover the description in ver. 7 of Saul's fellow-travelers, that they \"saw no man,\" implies, by contrast, that Saul did. The reticence of both St. Paul and St. Luke as to what he saw, and what was the appearance of the Lord Jesus, seems to arise from profound reverence and awe, such as St. Paul speaks of in 2 Corinthians 12:4. It may be also worth remarking how this appearance of Christ was deferred till he was quite close to Damascus, according to one tradition only a quarter of a mile from the gates, but according to Porter, whom Farrar and Lewin follow, at a distance of about ten miles, at a village called Caueab. So the intervention of the angel by which Isaac's life was spared was not till Abraham had the knife in his hand to slay his son; and Peter's prison doors were opened not till the very night before he was to have been brought forth to death. Faith and patience are thus strengthened, and God's intervention is more marked. There is not the slightest trace in the narrative of what the fancy of many has suggested, that Saul's uneasy conscience was wrought up into a paroxysm as he approached Damascus, and so prepared the way for the vision of Christ. Even Canon Farrar's eloquent description of what he supposes to have been the thoughts which agitated Saul's mind on his eventful journey seems hardly to rest on any solid base (see 'Life of St. Paul,'vol. 1. Acts 10.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Now for and, A.V.; and the Lord said unto him for and to him said the Lord, A.V. Behold, I am here. The regular Hebrew answer (Genesis 22:1; 1 Samuel 3:4, 6, 8, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To for into, A.V., named for called, A.V.; a man of Tarsus for of Tarsus, A.V. The street; ῤύμη, usually the narrower lanes in a town as distinguished from the πλατεῖαι, or wide streets. So Luke 14:21, \"The streets and lanes of the city,\" and the LXX. in Isaiah 15:3, couple πλατεῖαι and ρύμαι. Here, however, the term applies to the principal street of the city, which runs quite straight from the east to the west gate, and is a mile long. It still exists, and is called the Sultany Street; but instead of being the wide and splendid street it was in the apostolic age, a hundred feet wide, with colonnades separating the two footways on the side from the central read, and adorned with a triumphal arch, it is contracted into a narrow mean passage (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 69).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - He hath seen for hath seen in a vision, A.V. and T.R.; laying his hands for putting his hand, A.V. and T.R.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - But for then, A.V.; from many for by many, A.V.; did for hath done, A.V. Ananias's answer shows his profound astonishment, mixed with doubt and misgiving, at the commission given to him. It shows, too, how the news of Saul's commission had preceded him, and caused terror among the disciples at Damascus. Little did Ananias suspect that this dreaded enemy would be the channel of God's richest blessings to his Church throughout all ages until the coming of Christ. How empty our fears often are l how ignorant are we where our chief good lies hid! But God knows. Let us trust him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Upon for on, A.V. That call upon thy name. So also ver. 21; Romans 10:12, 13; 1 Corinthians 1:2; and above, Acts 7:59, this same phrase describes the believer who makes his prayer to the Lord Jesus and trusts in his Name for salvation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - A chosen vessel (comp. Galatians 2:15; Romans 9:21, 22). To bear my name before the Gentiles (see Acts 22:21; Acts 26:17, 18; Romans 15:16; Galatians 2:7-9, etc.) and kings (Acts 25; Acts 26; 2 Timothy 4:16, 17, with reference to Nero), and the children of Israel. The Gentiles are named before the children of Israel, because St. Paul's special call was to be the apostle of the Gentiles. But we know that even St. Paul's practice was to preach Christ to the Jews first, in every city where there were Jews.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Many for great, A.V. St. Paul's whole life was the fulfillment of this word of Christ (see 2 Corinthians 11:23-27; 2 Corinthians 6:4-10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Departed for went his way, A.V.; laying for putting, A.V.; who appeared for that appeared, A.V.; which thou earnest for as, etc., A.V.; mayest for mightest, A.V. The laying on of hands is the medium of conveying any special grace. Here it precedes the baptism, and was the channel of restoring sight to his eyes. Doubtless he did not receive the Holy Ghost till after his baptism (see Acts 2:38.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Straightway for immediately, A.V.; as it were for as it had been, A.V.; received his sight for received sight forthwith, A.V. and T.R.; he arose for arose, A.V. As it were scales (λεπίδες); scales, or flakes; any thin substance which peals off; a frequent term in Greek medical writers. And was baptized. It is a curious difference between St. Paul and the other apostles that, if they were baptized at all, which is doubtful, they must have been baptized by Christ himself; whereas St. Paul received his baptism at the hands of Ananias. This is one mark of his being \"born out of due time.\" And yet he was not behind the very chiefest apostles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - He took food and for when he had received meat he, A.V.; and he was for then was Saul, A.V. and T.R. Some commentators would interpose the journey to Arabia (mentioned Galatians 1:17) between vers. 19 and 20; and this seems to be the intention of the A.V., where the clause commencing with Then (ver. 19) seems to wind up and close the preceding narrative. This too is the view strongly supported by Canon Farrar, vol. 1. Acts 11, and by Lewin. Alford places the journey to Arabia in the time comprised in ver. 22; others before ver. 22; Neander, Meyer, and others, in the time comprised in the \"many days\" of ver. 23. And this last is undoubtedly the easiest, were it not for the considerations urged by Farrar with great force as to the probability of St. Paul seeking a period of retirement after his conversion before commencing any public preaching, and the further countenance given to this view by Galatians 1:17, where St. Paul certainly says of himself that εὐθέως, immediately, after his conversion he \"went away to Arabia.\" Taking all things into consideration, and supposing that either Luke was not aware of the sojourn in Arabia, or that he omitted from his notes some brief notice of it immediately preceding the description of Saul's preaching in Damascus, which explained the following εὐθέως, it seems best to understand the latter part of ver. 19 and all that follows as subsequent to his return from Arabia; and to conclude that he only stayed at Damascus ἡμέρας τίνας, a few days, after his conversion, and then retired to Arabia. It may be observed, too, that this interpretation gives a significance to the mention of the \"certain days\" which otherwise it has not. There is a further difference of opinion as to what is meant by Arabia. The most common view is that Auranitis, bordering upon Arabia Deserts, and reckoned as part of Arabia, not above two days' journey from Damascus, is the country meant. But others understand it in its more strictly Hebrew sense of the Peninsula of Sinai (Farrar, vol. 1. p. 212, and Exeursus 9; Dean Howson on Galatians in 'Speaker's Commentary;' Bishop Lightfoot on Galatians 1:17). This view is decidedly strengthened by the fact that, in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians, St. Paul clearly means by Arabia the Peninsula of Arabia, where Sinai was (Galatians 4:25). On the assumption that the Sinaitic Peninsula is meant, Bishop Lightfoot says, \"He was attracted thither by a spirit akin to that which formerly had driven Elijah to the same region. Standing on the threshold of the new covenant, he was anxious to look upon the birthplace of the old; that, dwelling for a while in seclusion in the presence of the mount that burned with fire, he might ponder over the transient glories of the ministration of death, and apprehend its real purpose in relation to the more glorious covenant which was now to supplant it.\" His journey to Arabia need not necessarily have occupied more than two or three mouths. It seems certain that he did not preach there, because he says (Acts 26:20), \"I declared to them at Damascus first,\" etc. (see another coincidence between the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians in Acts 13:2, note).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - In the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus for he preached Christ in the synagogues, A.V. and T.R. The preponderance of manuscript authority, and the ὄνομα of ver. 21, and the ὅτι οϋτός ἐστιν ὁ Ξριστός of ver. 22, seem conclusive in favor of Jesus rather than Christ. As regards the expression straightway, we must understand it as descriptive of Saul's action upon his return from Arabia. Is it possible that St. Luke uses it with the same meaning as he may have heard St. Paul use it in when speaking of his Damascus preaching, in the same sense as St. Paul actually does speak in Galatians 1:17, viz. as expressing that he did not wait for authority from the apostles, but at once, fresh from the Divine call, and having a direct commission from Christ himself, entered upon his apostolic ministry? If the Epistle to the Galatians was written A.D. , it would be just about the time that St. Luke joined St. Paul, and might be commencing to collect materials for his history. So that the phrase in the Galatians and the phrase in this twentieth verse might really be the expression of one thought committed to paper by St. Paul on the one hand, and uttered in the ear of Luke on the other. It is a confirmation of this view that in 2 Corinthians, written about the same time, there is also an account of Saul's escape from Damascus. In the synagogues; the very synagogues (ver. 2) to which the letters of the high priest were addressed, empowering him to arrest either man or woman who called upon the Name of Jesus, and bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem to be tried before the Sanhedrim. No wonder they were amazed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And for but, A.V.; that in Jerusalem made havoc of for that destroyed them (which called on this Name) in Jerusalem, A.V.; and he had come hither for this intent for and came hither for that intent, A.V., differently stopped; before for unto, A.V. The chief priests. The plural seems to mark how the high priesthood at this period was passed from one to another. Caiaphas, Annas, Jonathan, and Theophilus would all be included under the term.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The Christ for very Christ, A.V. The repetition of the phrase ὅτι οῦτός ἐστιν (vers. 20 and 22) is remarkable. As already observed, it presupposes the mention of Jesus, of whom it is thus predicated that he is both \"the Son of God\" and \"the Christ\" (comp. Acts 2:32, 36; Acts 4:11, etc.). Observe the incidental proof of the general expectation of the Jews that Christ should come in this description of the apostolic preaching as directed to the one point that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - When for after that, A.V.; took counsel together for took counsel, A.V. The phrase many days is quite elastic enough to comprehend whatever time remained to make up the three years (Galatians 1:18) which St. Paul tells us intervened between his conversion and his visit to Jerusalem (see ver. 43; Acts 18:18; 37:7; 14:3). Luke frequently uses ἱκανός for \"many\" (Luke 7:11; Luke 8:27; Luke 23:8). So in Hebrew, יָמִים רַבַּים, many days, is applied to considerable portions of time. In 1 Kings 2:38, 39, it is applied to three years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Their plot (ἐπιβουλή) became known for their laying await was known, A.V.; to Saul for of Saul, A.V.; the gates also for the gates, A.V. and T.R.; that they might for to, A.V.; a colon instead of full point at end of verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - But for then, A.V.; his disciples for the disciples, A.V. and T.R.; through for by, A.V; lowering him in for in, A.V. Lowering him, etc. The A.V. gives the sense freely; and combining the verb καθῆκαν with the participle χαλάσαντες, translates both by the one word \"let him down.\" The by of the A.V. seems preferable to the through of the R.V., as through suggests the idea, which cannot be intended, of making a hole in the wall. The escape of the spies from Jericho, as described in Joshua 2:15, was exactly in the same way, except that they had only a rope to descend by, whereas St. Paul had a rope-basket. In the description of his escape given by St. Paul to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11:33), he uses the same word for \"let down\" (ἐχαλάσθην), tells us he was let down \"by the wall,\" R.V. διὰ τοῦ τείχους, with the additional particular that he got out through the window, διὰ θυρίδος, and that it was a σαργάνη, a basket made of ropes (which describes the kind of basket somewhat more accurately than the σπυρίς here used) in which he was let down (see note on ver. 20). The passage in 2 Corinthians gives us a further interesting account of how the Jews went about to accomplish their purpose of killing Paul. It seems that at this time, either in revolt against the Romans or by permission of Caligula (it is not known certainly which), a certain Aretas, or Hareth, King of Arabia Petrea, included Damascus in his dominions for a time, i.e. through the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. He appointed an ethnarch, who was doubtless a Jew, to rule the large Jewish population according to their Law, and who was the ready tool of the unbelieving Jews, using his power as governor to have the gates kept day and night so as to prevent Saul's escape. But he that keepeth Israel neither slumbered nor slept, and by his watchful providence Saul escaped from their hands. As regards the R.Y., his disciples for the disciples, Alford adopts the reading λαβόντες δὲ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτόν, and holds αὐτοῦ of the R.T. to be simply a mistake for αὐτόν, caused by the situation of αὐτόν after λαβόντες. The R.T. cannot be right. \"The disciples\" is St. Luke's regular expression for \"Christians\" (Acts 6:1, 2, 7; Acts 9:10, 19, 26; Acts 14:22; Acts 21:16), and is our Lord's name for his followers, but is never used by an apostle of his own followers (see 1 Corinthians 1:12, 13; 1 Corinthians 3:4-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - He for Saul, A.V. and T.R.; and they were for but, etc., A.V.; not believing for and believed not, A.V. The narrative thus far exactly agrees with Galatians 1:17, 18, which, however, supplies the motive of the journey to Jerusalem, which is not here mentioned, viz. to see Peter. It seems strange to some commentators that the news of Saul having become a zealous Christian should not have reached Jerusalem after an interval of three years. But first, we do not know. how much of those three years was spent in Arabia, nor how much the unsettled state of Damascus may have interrupted the usual communication between Jerusalem and Damascus, nor how suspicious of evil the poor persecuted disciples at Jerusalem may have been. They knew of the fierceness of Saul's zeal as a persecutor by their own experience; they knew of him as a disciple only by report. It may have been only an instance of the truth of Horace's maxim, \"Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures quam quae sunt occults subjecta fidelibus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - How at Damascus he had preached boldly for how he had preached boldly at Damascus, A.V. As regards the statement that Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, which some have thought inconsistent with Galatians 1:18 19, it is obvious to remark that St. Luke's account is fully justified by the fact that St. Paul did, on Barnabas's introduction, make the acquaintance of Peter, and, as it seems, pass fifteen days as his guest (Galatians 1:18); and while there, did also see James the Lord's brother. The other apostles were probably absent from Jerusalem during that fortnight; but Barnabas did, it seems, at a Church assembly, in the presence of James and, no doubt, the elders of the Church, give the astonishing narrative of Saul's conversion. This removed their suspicious and their fears, and he was freely, during the rest of his brief stay, admitted as a brother to their assemblies, and took part in preaching the gospel in the synagogues.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Going in for coming in, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Preaching boldly, etc, the and of the T.R. is omitted, and this clause connected with the preceding one; the Lord for the Lord Jesus, A.V. and T.R.; he spake for he spake boldly, A.V. (The παῥῤησιαζόμενος (translated preaching boldly) ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Κυρίου, is in the R.T. separated from ἐλάλει); the Grecian Jews for the Grecians, A.V., as in Acts 6:1; to kill for to slay, A.V. The Grecian Jews; or, Hellenists (margin). St. Stephen was a Hellenist, and it was among the Hellenists that his evangelical labors elderly lay and from whose enmity he met his death. Saul showed his dauntless spirit, and perhaps his deep compunction at the part he had taken in Stephen's death, by thus encountering their bitter and unrelenting enmity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - And when the brethren knew it for which when the brethren knew, A.V. St. Paul gives another reason for his hasty departure from Jerusalem in his speech from the castle stairs (Acts 22:17-21). Caesarea, when standing alone, means Caesarea Stratonis, or Παράλιος, or Sebaste, the seaport and Roman garrison of that name, as distinguished from Caesarea Philippi (see Alford's note on Acts 8:30), and is always so used by St. Luke (Luke 8:40; Luke 10:1, 24; Luke 18:22; Luke 21:8, 16; Luke 23:23, 33; 25:1, 4, 6; 27:1, 2, showing it was a seaport). There is no reasonable doubt that it means the same place here. A seaport, near to Jerusalem, and with Roman protection, affording access to Tarsus either by sea or land as should seem best, was the natural place for Paul's friends to take him to. If further proof were wanting, it could be found in the phrase, \"brought him down,\" as compared with the converse, \"gone up\" (Acts 18:22), \"ascended \"(Acts 25:1), when the journey was from Caesarea to Jerusalem. To Tarsus. A glance at the map will show that, starting from Caesarea, a person might either go by land along the sea-coast of Phoenicia, through Acre, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrout, Tripolis, Antioch, Issus, to Tarsus; or by sea to any of the intermediate ports between Caesarea and Tarsus; or rather the artificial harbor at the mouth of the Cydnus which formed the seaport of Tarsus. It is not improbable that Paul landed at Selcucia, since he says (Galatians 1:21) that he came at this time \"into the regions of Syria and Cilicia,\" which is exactly what he would have done if he had landed at Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - So the Church... had peace, being edified for then had the Churches rest,... and were edified, A.V. and T.R.; was multiplied for were multiplied, A.V. and T.R. It is thought that the attention of the Jews to the progress of the faith of Jesus Christ was diverted at this time, and their active hostility stayed, by the still greater danger to the Jews' religion which arose from Caligula's intention of placing a statue to himself as a god in the holy of holies. Thus did God's gracious providence intervene to give rest to his harassed saints, and to build up his Church in numbers, in holiness, and in heavenly comfort. Especially Paul had another breathing-time, which may have been the more required if, as is thought, one at least of the five scourgings mentioned in 2 Corinthians 12:24 had been inflicted at Damascus, and one of the three shipwrecks alluded to in the same passage and been undergone in the dangerous coasting voyage from Caesarca to Scleucia.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - Went for passed, A.V.; all parts (διὰ πάντων) for all quarters, A.V. All parts. Afford, following Meyer, understands \"through all the saints,\" which is scarcely so well. The current of St. Luke's narrative is here temporarily diverted from St. Paul, in order to trace that portion of St. Peter's apostolic work, which led immediately to that opening of the door of faith to the Gentiles in which Peter was to have the priority in point of time (Matthew 16:18, 19), but Paul the chief burden of labour and danger (Galatians 2:7-9; Romans 11:13), and which was also the main subject of St. Luke's history. He came down; Lydda (afterwards called Diospolis, now Ludd), being more than half-way between Jerusalem and the sea-coast at Joppa.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there he found a certain man named AEneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - For he was palsied for and was sick of the palsy, A.V.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Peter said unto him, AEneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - Healeth thee for maketh thee whole, A.V.; straightway he arose for he arose immediately, A.V. Jesus Christ healeth thee. The juxtaposition, ἰᾶταί δε Ἰησοῦς, looks almost like an intentional play upon the sound. Some of the Fathers who did not know Hebrew derived the name Ἰησοῦς from ἰάομαι, and the Anglo-Saxon name for the Savior Haelend, the Healer, seems to have the same origin. Arise and make thy bed. Not (says Meyer), \"Henceforth make thine own bed,\" but, as the force of the imperative script requires, maize thy bed now, both as a token of his miraculous cure, and that he might carry it away (Mark 2:9-12). AEneas is a Greek name, not identical with AEneas (Αἰνείας), but occurring in Thucydides and elsewhere. If it was a Hebrew name, it might be derived from עַיִן חָם, \"(whom) the eye spareth.\" It is uncertain whether AEneas was a disciple or not.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - In Sharon for at Saron, A.V.; they turned for turned, A.V. In Sharon. The Greek represents the Hebrew שָׁרון, Sharon, which is the name of the rich plain which stretches from Joppa to Caesarea (see Isaiah 33:9). The name still lingers in the village of Saron. They turned; manifestly an improvement on the A.V., as giving the sense of οἵτινες, viz. that all who saw the paralytic walking, turned, as a consequence, to the Lord, in whose Name the wonderful miracle had been wrought. A very extensive conversion of the people of Lydda and of Sharon is signified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Joppa; now Jaffa, the ancient seaport of Jerusalem (Jonah 1:3; 2 Chronicles 2:16). It was in the tribe of Dan (Joshua 19:46). A certain disciple; a female disciple, as the word means; μαθήτρια only occurs here in the New Testament and rarely elsewhere. Tabitha; the Aramean form of the Hebrew צְבִי, a gazelle, or in Greek Dorcas. The beauty and grace of the gazelle made it an appropriate name for a woman. Some have thought, with probability, that she was a deaconess of the Church. The thirty-eighth verse shows that there was already a Church at Joppa About half the population of seven thousand are said to be still Christians. Compare the qualifications of a widow as set forth by St Paul (1 Timothy 5:10). The phrase, good works, is quite Pauline (Ephesians 2:10; Colossians 1:10; Titus 2:7; 1 Timothy 2:10). Almsdeeds. The word alms (from ἐλεημοσυνή) is one of those Greek words which has been domiciled in the English language through the Church. So bishop, priest, deacon, Κύριε ἐλέητον, trisagion, stole, Paschal, Litany, Liturgy, and many others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - Fell sick for was sick, A.V.; and when they had washed her for whom when they had washed, A.V. For the phrase in those days, comp. Acts 6:1. The days here meant are those while Peter was in those parts. An upper chamber (ὑπερώον), as in Acts 1:13. The upper chamber was much more private and quiet than a room on the ground floor (see 2 Kings 4:10, 11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - As for forasmuch as, A.V.; unto for to, A.V.; the disciples, hearing... sent for and the disciples had heard... they sent, A.V.; two men unto him for unto him two men, A.V.; entreating for desiring, A.V.; delay not to come on unto us for that he would not delay to come to them, A.V. and T.R. It is impossible to say whether any vague hope that Dorcas might be restored to life by Peter's prayers animated those who sent for Peter, and who had either seen or heard of the miracles wrought by him at Jerusalem before the persecution (Acts 5:15), or whether it only was that they felt the need of comfort and support in so great a sorrow. Two men; so Acts 10:7. Cornelius sends two of his household servants (comp. Acts 13:2; Acts 15:22). In unsafe times and by dangerous roads, it was customary to send two messengers, both for mutual protection and that, if anything happened to one, the other might still deliver the message. It was also a security against fraud.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - And for then, A.V.; and when for when, A.V. All the widows. The article may denote all the widows for whom Dorcas had made garments, which the middle voice (ἐπιδεικνύμεναι), found only here, indicates perhaps that they had on them at the time. But it is quite as probable that αἱ χῆραι means the Church widows, as in Acts 6:1 and 1 Timothy 5:9, and that we have here an indication that the model of the Jerusalem Church was followed in all the daughter Churches. Dorcas's almsdeeds would naturally have for their first object the widows of her own communion. As naturally would they all come to meet the apostle at her house.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Turning for turning him, A.V.; he said for said, A.V. Peter's action in putting them all forth seems to have been framed on the model of that scene at which he had been present when Jesus raised the daughter of Jairus (see Luke 8:54 [T.R.]; Matthew 9:25; Mark 5:40). Privacy for the more earnest concentrated prayer was doubtless what he sought. Kneeled down; θεὶς τὰ γόνατα. The same expression as in Acts 7:60; Acts 20:36; Acts 21:5; Luke 22:41. It occurs also in Mark 15:19. Tabitha, arise. Exactly the same address as our Lord's \"Talitha cumi\" (Mark 5:40), but, as Lange observes, with this difference, that in the case of Peter it was preceded by prayer; comp. also Luke 7:14 (where the Aramean address was probably in the same form); John 11:43.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 41. - Raised for lifted, A.V.; calling for when he had called, A.V.; he presented for presented, A.V. The saints and widows; by which we learn that others of the Christians of Joppa besides the widows had come to meet Peter, as was to be expected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - It became known for it was known, A.V.; on for in, A.V. As in ver. 35, the result of the healing of the palsied man at Lydda was that very many \"turned to the Lord,\" so here the like effect was produced at Joppa by the restoration of Dorcas to life. Many believed on the Lord. And St. John tells us (John 20:31) that the very purpose of the record which he wrote of the miracles of Christ is \"that we may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing we may have life in his Name.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTActs9:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - Abode for tarried, A.V. Many days (ἡμέρας ἱκανάς); the same phrase as ver. 23; spoken of a time of indeterminate length. Here probably it means some months, luring which Peter would be evangelizing the whole neighborhood. The Jews are said to have considered the trade of a tanner unclean; but if this were so, it would not be safe to infer that Peter was already indifferent to ceremonial uncleanness. We know he was not so (Acts 10:14), but probably in his line of life he could not act up to all the nicer distinctions of the strictest Pharisees.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
