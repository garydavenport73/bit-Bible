When Moses thus interceded, God commanded him to prepare two new tables of stone, and to construct an ark in which to keep them (cf. Exodus 34:1, etc.). Directions had been given for the construction of the ark before the apostasy of the people, and it was not made till after the tabernacle had been erected, nor were the tables placed in it till the tabernacle had been consecrated (cf. Exodus 25:10, etc.; Exodus 40:20). But as the things themselves were closely connected, Moses mentions them here together, without regard to chronological order.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Not only did God, of his grace and in response to the intercession of Moses, give to the people, notwithstanding their apostasy, the ark of the covenant with the new tables of the Law, but he followed this up by instituting the high priesthood; and, when Aaron died, caused it to be continued to his son Eleazar. This Moses reminds the people of by referring to a fact in their past history, viz. their arrival at Mosera, where Aaron died, and Eleazar succeeded him in his office. Beeroth of the children of Jaakan (wells of the sons of Jaakan); the same place as Bene-jaakan (Numbers 33:31), probably the Horite tribe, called 'Akan (Genesis 36:27), for which, apparently, should be read Jakan, as in 1 Chronicles 1:42. Mosera; Moseroth, plu. of Mosera (Numbers 33:30). As Aaron died there, Mosera must have been in the vicinity of Mount Her. Gudgodah, Hor-hagidgad (Numbers 33:32); cave of Gidgad, a place of caves. Jotbath, Jotbathah (Numbers 33:33), a district abounding in streams, whence probably its name, Jot-bathah, pleasantness, from יָטַב, to be good, to please. None of these places have been identified. Robinson mentions a Wady cf. Ghadaghidh, a broad sandy valley diverging from the Wady es Jerafeh, in the desert of Et-Tih, and this has been supposed to indicate the site of Gudgodah; but the difference of the consonants in the two words is such as to render this identification more than doubtful. In the Arabic of the London Polyglott, גדגדה is represented by (Judjuda), which is totally different from Ghadaghidh. All the places, however, must have been in the 'Arabah, and in the region of Mount Her, or not far distant. That the places mentioned here are the same as those in Numbers cannot be doubted. The two passages, however, relate to different journeys; that in Numbers to the journeying of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai to Kadesh, that in Deuteronomy to the march in the fortieth year, when they went from Kadesh to Mount Her.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - Moses, here resuming the form of address, refers to the separation of the tribe of Levi to the holy service. Verse 8. - At that time; the time when the covenant was restored at Sinai, not the time when Aaron died. The appointment of the tribe of Levi for service took place in connection with that of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood (Numbers 3:4). The service to which the tribe of Levi was chosen appertained to the tribe as such, including the priests as well as the non-priestly Levites, though parts of it specially belonged to the one class rather than the other. Thus the bearing of the ark was the special duty of non-priestly Levites, the Kohathites (Numbers 4:4, etc.; 1 Chronicles 15:15); but was also, on peculiarly solemn occasions, discharged by the priests (Joshua 3:6, etc.; Joshua 6:6; 8:33; 1 Kings 8:3, 6, etc.). To stand before the Lord to minister unto him was the special function of the priests (Deuteronomy 17:12; Deuteronomy 21:5; Ezekiel 40:46; Ezekiel 44:15, 16); but as the service of the Levites was also a sacred service, they too are said to stand to minister before the Lord (Deuteronomy 18:7; 1 Chronicles 15:2; 2 Chronicles 23:6; 2 Chronicles 29:4, 5, 11, 12). To bless in his name does not mean, as some propose, to invoke the Name of God, or to praise his Name, but to pronounce a benediction or invoke a blessing on the people in his Name (cf. 2 Samuel 6:18; 1 Chronicles 16:2). This was the special duty of the priests (cf. Numbers 6:22-27; Deuteronomy 21:5; 1 Chronicles 23:13), but might also be done by others (as by David), and in this benediction the Levites might join (2 Chronicles 25:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - (Cf.

As at the first, he was on the mount the second time forty days and forty nights; and in response to his pleading, the Lord willed not to destroy Israel, and commanded him to resume his place as leader of the people, and conduct them to the Promised Land \"This commandment and promise was a testimony that God now was reconciled unto them by the intercession of Moses\" (Ainsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12, 13. - God had showed great favor to Israel; what return did he require? Only what, without any prescription, they were bound to render - fear, love, and obedience (comp. Micah 6:8). To fear the Lord thy God (cf. Deuteronomy 6:2, 13). To walk in all his ways; to receive his truth, accept his law, and follow the course of conduct which he prescribes (cf. Genesis 18:19; Psalm 25:4, 5; Psalm 67:2; Acts 18:25, 26). To love him (cf. Exodus 20:6). \"Fear with love! Love without fear relaxes; fear without love enslaves, and leads to despair\" (J. Gerhard). There is a fear with which love cannot coexist - a fear which hath torment, and which love casts out as its antagonist (1 John 4:18); but the fear of God which he requires is that pious reverence which not only can coexist with love to him, but is not where love is not. And to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul. Love prompts to service. Wherever love fills the heart, it seeks expression in acts of service to its object; and where no such expression comes forth, the evidence is wanting of the existence of the emotion in the bosom (cf. John 14:15, 23; Galatians 5:13; 1 John 3:18). For thy good (cf. Deuteronomy 5:29; Deuteronomy 6:24). \"In serving the Lord the glory redoundeth unto him, the benefit to ourselves; for them that honor him he will honor (1 Samuel 2:30), and 'godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come' (1 Timothy 4:8)\" (Ainsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD'S thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - To love and serve the Lord, Israel was specially bound, because of God's love to them and choice of them to be his people. He, the Lord and Proprietor of the universe, was free to choose any of the nations he pleased, and needed not the service of any, but of his free grace he chose Israel, in whose fathers he had delight, to love them (cf. Exodus 19:5). The heaven and the heaven of heavens; the highest heavens, all that may be called heaven, with all that it contains. Delight (\"set his eve upon,\" Deuteronomy 7:7); literally, cleaved to, was attached to. \"Affection, love, choice, the three moments prompting from the innermost impulses to the historical act\" (Lange).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCircumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They were, therefore, to lay aside all insensibility of heart and all obduracy, to acknowledge God's supremacy, to imitate his beneficence, and to fear and worship him. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart. As circumcision was the symbol of purification and sign of consecration to God, so the Israelites are enjoined to realize in fact what that rite symbolized, viz. purity of heart and receptivity for the things of God. This is enforced by the consideration that Jehovah the alone God, the Almighty, is mighty and terrible without respect to persons, and at the same time is a righteous Judge, and the Protector of the helpless and destitute.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - God of gods (Psalm 136:2). Not only supreme over all that are called god, but the complex and sum of all that is Divine; the Great Reality, of which the \"gods many\" of the nations were at the best but the symbols of particular attributes or qualities. Which regardeth not persons; is not partial, as a judge who has respect to the condition and circumstances of parties rather than to the merits of the case (cf. Leviticus 19:15; Acts 10:34; Ephesians 6:9; Jude 1:16). Nor taketh reward; cloth not accept presents as bribes (cf. Deuteronomy 16:19; 2 Chronicles 19:7; Job 34:19; Micah 3:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18, 19. - As the impartial and incorruptible Judge, God executes the judgment of the fatherless and widow, vindicates the right of the defenseless (Psalm 68:6; Psalm 146:9); and as the God of the whole earth, he loveth the stranger, helpless, and it may be oppressed, and giveth him food and raiment. Following him, Israel, as his people, were to be benevolent to the stranger, inasmuch as they themselves had been strangers in Egypt, and knew by experience what it was to be a stranger (cf. Exodus 22:20; Leviticus 19:33, 34). They were to love the stranger as God loves him, by relieving his necessities (cf. James 2:15, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLove ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Reverting to his main theme, Moses anew exhorts Israel to fear Jehovah their God, and to show true reverence to him by serving him, by cleaving to him, and by swearing in his Name (cf. Deuteronomy 4:4; Deuteronomy 6:13; Acts 11:23). Such reverence was due from Israel to God, because of the great things he had done for them, and those terrible acts by which his mighty power had been displayed on their behalf.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - He is thy praise, i.e. the Object of thy praise; the Being who had given them abundant cause to praise him, and whom they were bound continually to praise (cf. Psalm 22:3; Psalm 109:1; Jeremiah 17:14). Terrible things; acts which by their greatness and awful effects inspired fear and dread into those by whom they were witnessed. For thee; literally, with thee, i.e. either in thy view or towards thee, for thy behoof (comp. Deuteronomy 1:30; 1 Samuel 12:7; Zechariah 7:9; and such an expression as \"deal kindly [literally, do Madness] with,\" Genesis 24:49, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy10:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Among other marvelous acts toward Israel, was one done in Israel itself; they, whoso fathers went down to Egypt only seventy in number (Genesis 46:26, 27), had, notwithstanding the cruel oppression to which they were subjected there, grown to a nation numberless as the stars (cf.

The doings of God to the people in the wilderness comprehend the manifestations of his omnipotence, both in their guidance and protection, and in the punishment of those who transgressed. One instance of the latter is expressly referred to - the destruction of those who joined in the insurrection of Korah (cf. Numbers 16:31-33). Moses does not mention Korah himself here, but only his accomplices Dathan and Abiram, probably, as Keil suggests, \"from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah;\" perhaps also because, though Korah was at the head of the insurrection, Dathan and Abiram were the more determined, audacious, and obdurate in their rebellion (cf. Numbers 16:12-15, 25, 26), so that it came to be named from them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - All the substance that was in their possession; literally, every living thing (Genesis 7:4, 23) that was at their feet, i.e. all their followers (cf. \"all the people that follow, thee,\" Exodus 11:8; \"all the men that appertained unto Korah,\" Numbers 16:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-9. - Thus from what they themselves had witnessed does Moses admonish the elder members of the congregation, summoning them to recognize in that the purpose of God to discipline and train them, that so they might keep his commandments and be strengthened in soul and purpose to go in and possess the land, and to live long therein (Deuteronomy 1:38; Deuteronomy 4:26; Deuteronomy 6:3).

Canaan was not like Egypt, a country that depended for its fertility on being irrigated by man's labor or by artificial processes, but was a land where the supply and distribution of water was provided for in natural reservoirs and channels, by means of which the rain which God, who cared for the land, sent plentifully on it, was made available for useful purposes. In Egypt there is little or no rain, and the people are dependent on the annual overflowing of the Nile for the proper irrigation of their fields; and as this lasts only for a short period, the water has to be stored and redistributed by artificial means, often of a very laborious kind. Wateredst it with thy foot. \"The reference, perhaps, is to the manner of conducting the water about from plant to plant and from furrow to furrow. I have often watched the gardener at this fatiguing and unhealthy work. When one place is sufficiently saturated, he pushes aside the sandy soil between it and the next furrow with his foot, and thus continues to do until all are watered. He is thus knee-deep in mud, and many are the diseases generated by this slavish work. Or the reference may be to certain kinds of hydraulic machines which were turned by the feet. I have seen small water-wheels, on the plain of Acre and elsewhere, which were thus worked; and it appeared to me to be very tedious and toilsome, and, if the whole country had to be irrigated by such a process, it would require a nation of slaves like the Hebrews, and taskmasters like the Egyptians, to make it succeed. Whatever may have been the meaning of Moses, the Hebrews no doubt had learned by bitter experience what it was to water with the foot; and this would add great force to the allusion, and render doubly precious the goodly land which drank of the rain of heaven, and required no such drudgery to make it fruitful\" (Thomson, ' The Land and the Book,' 2:279; edit. Lend. 1859). Philo describes a machine cf. this sort as in use in Egypt ('De Confus. Linguar.,' Opp. 1:410, edit. Mangey); and in that country, \"a garden of herbs\" is still generally watered by means of a machine of simple construction, consisting of a wheel, round which revolves an endless rope to which buckets are attached; this is worked by the feet of a man seated on a piece of wood fastened by the side of the machine, labor at once monotonous and severe (Niebuhr, 'Voyage en Arabic,' 1:121, 4to, Amst. 1776; 'Description de l'Arabic,' 1:219, 4to, Paris, 1779; Robinson, 'Bib. lies.,' 1:542; 2:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Careth for; literally, searcheth or inquireth after, i.e. thinks about and cares for (LXX., ἐπισκοπεῖται, oversees; cf. Job 3:4; Psalm 142:4; Jeremiah 30:17; Ezekiel 34:8; Isaiah 62:12). The eyes of the Lord thy God; i.e. his special watchful providence (cf. Psalm 33:18; Psalm 34:15; Ezekiel 4:5). It was a land on which Jehovah's regard was continually fixed, over which he watched with unceasing care, and which was sustained by his bounty; a land, therefore, wholly dependent on him, and so a fitting place for a people also wholly dependent on him, who owed to his grace all that they were and had.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Being thus wholly dependent on God, it behooved them to be careful to attend to his commandments and to obey them, that so his blessing might be continued to them and to the laud. If they would love and serve the Lord as they were bound to do, he would give them the rain of their land, i.e. rain for their land, such as it required (cf. \"rain of thy seed,\" Psalm 30:2, 3), in the proper season, the early and the latter rain, so that they should fully enjoy the benefits of the land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The first rain; the rain which falls from the middle of October to the end of December, which prepares the soil for the seed, and keeps it moist after the seed is sown. The latter rain; that which falls in March and April, about the time when the grain is ripening for harvest; during the time of harvest no rain falls in Palestine. But if they allowed themselves to be deceived and misled, so as to apostatize from the Lord and serve other gods and worship them, the Divine displeasure would be shown in the withholding from them of the blessing, so that they should miserably perish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - That your heart be not deceived; literally, lest your heart be enticed or seduced (יִפְתָה). The verb means primarily to be open, and as a mind open to impressions from without is easily persuaded, moved either to good or evil, the word came to signify to induce in a good sense, or to seduce in a bad sense. Here the people are cautioned against allowing themselves to be enticed so as to be led astray by seductive representations (cf. Job 31:27; Proverbs 20:19 [\"flattereth\"]; Job 5:2 [\"silly one\"]; Hosea 7:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd then the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - He shut up the heaven. \"The heaven conceived as a womb\" (Schulz); cf.

Every place on which the soles of their feet should tread should be theirs, i.e. they had but to enter the land to become possessors of it. This is more exactly defined as restricted to the land the boundaries of which are given - from the Arabian desert on the south to Lebanon on the north, and from the river Euphrates on the east to the Mediterranean on the west (Deuteronomy 1:7).

Verse 26. - Behold, I set before you; place for your consideration (Deuteronomy 4:8; Deuteronomy 30:15), so that you may see whither tends obedience on the one hand, and disobedience on the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Other gods, which ye have not known; in contradistinction to Jehovah, the revealed God, made known to them by word and deed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - (Cf. Deuteronomy 27:11.) Thou shalt put the blessing; thou shalt give (נָתַתָּה), i.e. give forth, utter, announce, proclaim (cf. Genesis 49:21; Job 1:22 [gave, i.e. uttered impiety to God]; Psalm 50:20, gavest, didst utter, slandered. The two mountains named stand opposite to each other, with a valley between, about two hundred yards broad at the widest part, in which stood the town of Shechem, now Nablus. They were selected for the purpose mentioned, doubtless, because of their relative position, and probably also because they stand in the center of the land both from north to south, and from east to west. It has been suggested that Ebal was appointed for the uttering of the curse, and Gerizim for the uttering of the blessing, because the former was barren and rugged, the latter fertile and smooth; but this is not borne out by the actual appearance of the two bills, both being equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation. That Gerizim was selected for the blessing because of its position on the south side of the valley \"towards the region of light,\" while Ebal was appointed for the curse because it was on the north side, can be regarded only as an ingenious fancy. In ver. 30, the position of the two mountains is defined as on the other side of Jordan, i.e. on the side opposite to where the Israelites then were, the western side; and as by the way - rather, behind the way - where the sun goeth down; i.e. the road of the west, the great road which passed through the west-Jordan country, and which is still the main route from south to north in Palestine (Ritter, 4:293, etc.; Robinson, 3:127), passing Nablus and the two menu-rains on the east, so that they are behind it. Which dwell in the Champaign; in the 'Arabah (see Deuteronomy 1:1), \"mentioned here as that portion of the land on the west of the Jordan which lay stretched out before the eyes of the Israelites, who were encamped in the steppes of Moab\" (Keil). Over against Gilgal; i.e. not the Gilgal mentioned in Joshua 4:19, which was east of Jericho (hod. Jiljulia), nor the Gilgal of Joshua 12:23 (probably the modern Jiljulieh, in the plain of Sharon), but the Gilgal of Joshua 9:6; Joshua 10:6; and 2 Kings 2:1 (hod. Jiljilia), to the north of Bethel, from which there is \"a very extensive prospect over the great lower plain, and also over the sea\" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res,' 3:138); so that the mountains by Nablus may be very well described as \"over against it.\" Beside the plains of Moreh; for \"plains\" read oaks (cf. Genesis 12:6; Genesis 35:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAre they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31, 32. - The assurance that they should pass over Jordan and possess the land of Canaan, is assigned as a reason and motive why they should observe to do all that God had commanded them.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy11:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Deut.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVer 1. - These are the statutes and judgments (cf. Deuteronomy 4:1; Deuteronomy 6:1). Moses, as the servant of God, had taught Israel statutes and rights, as God had commanded him (Deuteronomy 4:5); and now he recapitulates the principal of these for their guidance in the way of obedience. These they were to observe all the days of their life upon the land that was to be given them; the land was the Lord's, and there, as long as they possessed it, the Law of the Lord was to be paramount.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 2, 3. - In order to this, Israel was, as soon as the land was possessed, to destroy all the objects and means of idolatrous worship in the land. Upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree (cf. Isaiah 57:7; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:6; Jeremiah 17:2; Hosea 4:13; 2 Kings 16:4; 2 Kings 17:10). The heathen had their places of worship on lofty elevations, probably because they imagined they were thus nearer to the object of their worship; and they sought also the shade of woods or thick-foliaged trees (Ezekiel 6:13), under which to perform their rites, as tending to inspire awe, and as in keeping with the mysterious character of their rites. These places of heathen worship in Canaan the Israelites were utterly to destroy, along with the images of their deities and other objects of idolatrous worship. Burn their groves; their asherahs, idol-pillars of wood (cf. Deuteronomy 7:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not do so unto the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-6. - The heathen placed their altars and offered their worship wherever they thought fit, according to their notions of the deity and his service; but Israel was not to do so unto Jehovah their God: he himself would choose the places where he was to be worshipped, and there alone might they come with offering and service. As the revealed God - the God whose being and perfections had been made known, not by a vague revelation of him in nature merely, but expressly by his putting or recording his Name historically and locally among men (cf. Exodus 20:24) - so should there be a definite place chosen and appointed by him where he would come to receive the worship of his people, where he would record his Name, and where he would be known for a Refuge and a Helper to all who put their trust in him (Psalm 48:3; Psalm 76:1, etc.; Daniel 9:18). The Name of God is God himself as revealed; and he puts his Name on any place where he specially manifests himself as present (cf. 1 Kings 8:29), and which is consequently to be regarded as his habitation or dwelling-place. Hence the temple at Jerusalem was in later times known as the place of the Name of Jehovah (Isaiah 18:7), the dwelling-place of his glory (Psalm 26:8). But he is the God of the whole earth, and therefore, wherever he is pleased to reveal himself, in whatever place he makes his Name to be known, there he is to be worshipped. There is no reference in this passage to the temple at Jerusalem specially, as some have supposed; what is here enjoined is only a practical application of the Divine promise, that in all places where God would record his Name, there he would come to bless his people (Exodus 20:24). The reference here, therefore, is quite general, and applies to any place where, by the Divine appointment, the tabernacle might be set up and the worship of Jehovah instituted. Unto his habitation shall ye seek. To seek to any place means, primarily, to resort to it, to frequent it (cf. 2 Chronicles 1:5), but with the implied purpose of inquiring there for something, as for responses or oracles, when the place resorted to was that in which God had put his Name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - To the appointed place all their sacrificial gifts and offerings were to be brought, and there they were to keep their holy feasts. The gifts are classified in groups.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Burnt offerings and sacrifices, the two principal kinds of altar offerings, with which meal offerings and drink offerings were united (Numbers 15:4, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINE2. Tithes and heave offerings (cf. Leviticus 27:30-33; Numbers 18:21-24). The heave offerings are described as of your hand, either because offered by the offerer's own hand, or to indicate such gifts as were made off-hand (so to speak), voluntary offerings made in addition to the legal offerings from an immediate impulse of grateful emotion.NEWLINENEWLINE3. Vows and freewill offerings, sacrifices which were offered in consequence of vows or of spontaneous impulse (cf. Leviticus 7:16; Leviticus 22:21; Leviticus 23:38; Numbers 15:3; Numbers 29:39).NEWLINENEWLINE4. Firstlings of their herds and of their flocks (cf. Exodus 13:2, 12, etc.; Numbers 18:15, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And there ye shall eat before the Lord. The injunction here and in ver. 17, respecting the eating by the offerer of the firstlings of his flocks and herds, appears to be inconsistent with the injunction in Numbers 18:18. There it seems as if the whole of the flesh was to be given to the priest. \"And the flesh of them shall be thine [the priest's], as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.\" This may be taken to mean that just as the wave breast and the right shoulder are the perquisites of the priests in the case of other offerings, as e.g., the peace offering, so in the case of the firstling offering the whole flesh shall be the priest's; and thus taken, the passage presents an unquestionable discrepancy to that in Deuteronomy. But probably the passage is not to be so taken. The particle translated \"as\" (כְּ.) not infrequently occurs in the sense of \"according to, after the manner of,\" implying conformity to some rule or model (Genesis 44:2; Exodus 21:9; Exodus 39:8; Leviticus 5:10; Numbers 8:4; Numbers 9:3; Numbers 29:18; Psalm 7:18 [Psalm 7:17]; Zechariah 2:10 [Zechariah 2:6], etc.). The passage, therefore, may be rendered thus: And the flesh of them shalt thou take after the manner (or according to the rule), of the wave breast, etc., i.e. not the whole of it, but only these parts. So the LXX. seem to have taken the passage: καὶ τα κρεα εὐται κασα καὶ το στηθυνιον του ἐπιθέματος καὶ κατὰ τὸν βραχίονα τὸν δεξιὸν σοι ἔσται. Of some of the offerings the whole was received by the priest, as in the case of the sin offering and trespass offering (Leviticus 6:25, etc.; Leviticus 7:1, etc.); while of others only certain portions, viz. the wave breast and the heave shoulder, were given to him, as in the case of the peace offering (Leviticus 7:28, etc.). The purport of the law in Numbers 18:18 is that, in respect of the firstling offering, the allotment to the priest shall be after the same manner as in the peace offering. There is thus no discrepancy between the two passages. The animal belonged originally to the offerer; when he brought it before the Lord part of it was consumed on the altar, part of it was assigned to the priest, and the rest, as a matter of course, remained with himself. The law in Numbers, addressed to the priest, intimates what he might claim as his portion; the law in Deuteronomy, where the people are addressed, directs them how to use the portion that remained with them. It may be added that, even supposing that all the flesh was given to the priest, yet, as it had to be consumed on the day in which the sacrifice was offered, and as every clean person in the house might partake of it, it is almost certain that the offerer would, as a matter of course, share in the meal, as was usual in the case of sacrificial meals. Rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto; enjoy whatever your hand may gain, whatever you may earn, all the good which the Lord may give you (cf. ver. 18; 15:10; 23. 20; 28:8, 20). The phrase is peculiar to Deuteronomy; but comp. Genesis 3:22; Isaiah 11:14.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-10. - In the wilderness, while leading a nomadic life, no certain place could be appointed to them for the observance of sacred rites; each man did in that matter as suited his own convenience. But after they were settled in Canaan it should no longer be so; a certain order and fixed locality should be determined for their worship and service; when they had passed over Jordan the Lord would give them rest from all their enemies, and then all irregularity and arbitrariness in the matter of worship must cease, and all their gifts arid offerings must be brought to the place which Jehovah their God should choose.

Rejoice before the Lord. This phrase occurs frequently in this book (Deuteronomy 14:26; Deuteronomy 16:11, 14; Deuteronomy 26:11; Deuteronomy 27:7); elsewhere it appears only once - Leviticus 23:40, where it is used with reference to the Feast of Tabernacles, Moses now enjoins this festivity to be observed in connection with all the sacrificial meals. The Levite that is within your gates. The Levites had no share in the land as the property of their tribe; but they had towns allotted to them among the different tribes (Numbers 35.), so that in this way they were dispersed through the nation. Hence, perhaps, they are described as \"within the gates\" of the rest of the people. Or, as the Levites seem to have itinerated in the discharge of various offices among the people, the phrase may designate them as on this account occasionally resident among others in their community; just as \"the stranger that is within thy gates\" means the person of some other nation who for the time being was resident in any of the towns of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-16. - They were to beware of offering sacrifice in any place that might seem to them best; their offerings were to be presented only in that place which God should choose. But this did not imply that they were not to kill and eat in their own abodes whatever they desired for food, according to the blessing of Jehovah their God. Only they were to abstain from eating of blood (cf. Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 7:26); that they were to pour on the earth as if it were water. Burnt offering; this is named instar omnium, as the principal offering. Whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. To \"lust,\" in old English, means simply to will, choose, desire; it is the same word as \"list,\" or, as it is sometimes spelt, \"lest,\" and does not, as now, imply anything evil. As of the roebuck, and as of the hart; probably the gazelle and fallow deer.

Thou mayest not eat; literally, thou art not able to eat; i.e. there is a legal inability to this. So the verb to be able (יָכֹל) is frequently used (cf.

Only be sure; literally, only be strong; i.e. be firm and resolute, steadfastly resisting the temptation to eat it. The blood is the life (cf. Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 11:1; Leviticus 17:11). The word used is nephesh (נֶפֶשׁ). By this word the Hebrews designated the animal life-principle in men and in beasts; and as without this the body was a mere inert mass, the word came to be used for \"life\" generally. Of this life the blood was believed to be the seat, and was regarded as the symbol, so that to shed blood was tantamount to the taking away of life. As the blood, moreover, was the life, in it was supposed to lie the propitiatory power - the power, when shed, of atoning for sin, as the giving of life for life. The prohibition of eating it doubtless had respect to this. It was not merely to prevent ferocity in men towards the lower animals (as Rosenmüller suggests) that the eating of blood was interdicted, but specially because there was in this a sort of profanation, a putting to a common use of what appertained to a sacred rite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - The holy things; i.e. the offerings prescribed by the Law; \"hallowed things\" (Numbers 18:8; cf.

Thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood; i.e. the flesh and the blood of the burnt offerings which were to be laid upon the altar (Leviticus 1:5-9). The blood of thy sacrifices (zebachim) shall be poured out upon the altar. This refers to the ritual of the shelamim, or peace offering (Leviticus 3:2, 8, 13). The word zebach (זֶבַה) is never used in the Pentateuch of an atoning sacrifice (Oehler, 'Theology of the Old Testament,' 2:2); it is used only of such offerings as furnished a sacrificial meal; hence it is added here, and thou shalt eat the flesh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTObserve and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29, 30. - Here the speaker reverts to the admonition with which he began this part of his address (ver. 2); and warns the people against having any intercourse with the Canaanites in their idolatrous practices. That thou enquire not after their gods. It was a general belief among the heathen that to ignore or neglect the deities of a country was sure to bring calamity (cf. 2 Kings 17:26); hence the need of cautioning the Israelites against inquiring after the gods of the Canaanites when they should be settled in their land,NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy12:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - For even their sons and their daughters have they burnt in the fire to their gods. Elsewhere the phrase used is \"make to pass through the fire \"(Deuteronomy 18:10), or simply \"make to pass through to Molech\" (Leviticus 18:21; Jeremiah 32:35). This has led some to maintain that the ceremony described was merely a februation, a lustration by fire, and not an actual burning alive of these victims; but there can be no doubt that both among the Ammonites and the Phoenicians, and indeed wherever the worship of Baal or Molech was followed, the offering of children in sacrifice by burning prevailed (Munter, 'Religion der Karthager,' p. 18, 2nd edit.; Selden, 'De Diis Syris Syntag,' i.e. 6, pp. 93, 257, edit.

Dreamer of dreams. Not by visions or immediate suggestion only, but also by means of dreams, did God communicate with men (cf. Numbers 12:6). The case supposed here, then, is that of one pretending to have had revelations from God through those media by which God was pleased to convey his will to men (cf. Hem., 'Iliad,' h 62 - 'Ἀλλ ἄγε δή τινα μάντιν ἐρείομεν....NEWLINEη} καὶ ὀνειροπόλον καὶ γάρ τ᾿ ὄναρ ἔκ Διός ἐστιν Sign or a wonder. A sign was some event foretold by the prophet, and the occurrence of which was a token that something else which he announced would happen or should be done (cf. 1 Samuel 2:34; 1 Samuel 10:7-9; 2 Kings 19:29; Isaiah 7:11-14; Isaiah 38:7; Mark 13:4, etc.). A wonder was a miracle, the performance of which gave proof of a Divine commission (cf. Deuteronomy 4:24). These signs, it is assumed, should come to pass; nevertheless, the people were not to listen to the man who gave them to go after other gods. The mere fact that he sought to persuade them to forsake the worship of Jehovah was sufficient to prove him an impostor; for how could one who sought to seduce the people from God be sent by God? The sign which was given to authenticate such a message could only be one of those \"lying signs and wonders after the working of Satan,\" by which his emissaries try to deceive and mislead; and was permitted by God only that their fidelity to him might be tested and proved. They had already received God's message; they had his word; and no teaching which contravened that, however apparently authenticated, could be from him, or was to he accepted by them (cf. Jeremiah 29:8; Galatians 1:8, 9; 1 John 3:1, etc.). Come what might, they were to walk after Jehovah their God, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and serve him; and cleave unto him. The false prophet, as a public enemy and a suborner of treason against the King of Israel, was to be put to death; and so the evil would be put away from among them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-11. - A second case supposed is that of temptation to apostasy proceeding from some near relative or intimate friend. Not only was this to be resisted, but no consideration of affection or bend of friendship was to be allowed to interfere with the stern sentence which doomed the tempter to death; on the contrary, the person tempted was to be the first to lay hands on the tempter and put him to death. This was to be done by stoning, and the person he had tried to seduce was to cast the first stone. Verse 6. - Thy brother, the son of thy mother; thy full brother, allied to thee by the closest fraternal tie. The wife of thy Bosom; the object of thy tenderest affection, Whom it is thine to protect and cherish (cf. Deuteronomy 28:54, 56; Micah 7:5). Thy friend, which is as thine own soul; i.e. whom thou lovest as thyself. The word translated \"friend\" (רֵעַ, for רֵעֶהֹ) is from a verb which signifies to delight in, and conveys primarily the idea not merely of a companion, but of a friend in whom one delights; and the definition of true friendship is the loving another as one's self (Aristot., 'Eth. Nic.,' 9:5). As commonly used, however, the word designates any one with whom one has any dealing or intercourse; and so our Lord expounds it (Luke 10:29, etc.). Secretly. If the temptation was in private, and so known only to thyself.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNamely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Pity, spare, conceal.

In this case inquiry was to be made as to the fact; and if it was found to be so, the inhabitants of that city were to be put to the sword, all their property was to be burnt, and the city itself reduced to a heap; so should the anger of the Lord be averted from Israel, and he would do them good. Verse 12. - Hear in one of thy cities. The Hebrew phrase, \"to hear in\" (שָׁמַע בְּ). has sometimes the meaning of to overhear, as in Genesis 27:5; 1 Samuel 17:28; Job 15:8; sometimes it means simply to hear, as in 2 Samuel 19:36 [35]; in Job 26:14, it has the force of to hear of or concerning, though some think this questionable. This latter is apparently the meaning here: If thou hear concerning any of thy cities, etc. Baying. This introduces what is heard.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCertain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Men, the children of Belial; the sons of worthlessness, utterly worthless persons. Beli ya'al (a compound of בְלִי, not, and עָל, to ascend, to have worth, to profit) means primarily that which is low, hence worthlessness, naughtiness, wickedness. In Deuteronomy 15:9, Belial is rendered in the Authorized Version as an adjective, \"wicked,\" and also in Nehemiah 1:11. In Psalm 18:4, it is rendered by \"ungodly men.\" Most commonly it is treated as a proper name. But in all places the proper meaning of the word might be retained. The Hebrews described an object, of which any quality was predominantly characteristic, as the son of that quality. Are gone out from among you; have gone forth from the midst of you, i.e. have risen up among yourselves. Withdraw. The verb here is the same as that rendered by \"thrust,\" in vers. 5 and 10. It conveys the idea of drawing away with some degree of force, not mere easy seduction, but impulsion by strong persuasion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - After due inquiry, if it was found that such a thing had really been done in any of their cities, the extreme penalty was to be inflicted on the city and all its inhabitants - all were to be destroyed. Smite... with the edge of the sword; literally, with the mouth of the sword, as biting and devouring like a ravenous beast - a phrase for utter destruction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy13:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - All the spoil thereof every whir, for the Lord thy God; rather, all the spoil [booty] thereof as a whole offering unto Jehovah thy God; it was to be wholly devoted to God, and as such to be consumed by fire. \"It was a destruction, and not properly an offering. Hence the author selects neither עֹולָה nor חַטָּאת, but כָּליִל, whole, whole offering (Deuteronomy 33. '10; Leviticus 6:15 [22]), which word, in the law concerning offering, is no technical designation of any particular kind of offering. The rendering omnino is untenable\" (Knobel). The city was to be made a ruin, never to be rebuilt; and thus was to be treated the same as a heathen, idolatrous city might be (cf.

There are, however, some differences between the two accounts which may be noticed.NEWLINENEWLINE1. In Deuteronomy, the mammals which may be used for food are severally specified as well as described by the general characteristic of the class; in Leviticus, only the latter description is given.NEWLINENEWLINE2. In the list of fowls which may not be eaten, the raah (glade) is mentioned in Deuteronomy, but not in Leviticus; and the bird which in the one is called da'ah, is in the other called dayyah (vulture).NEWLINENEWLINE3. The class of reptiles which is carefully described in Leviticus is wholly omitted in Deuteronomy.NEWLINENEWLINE4.

The roebuck; tsebi (צְבִי), the gazelle (Gazella Arabica). The fallow deer; yachmur (יחְמוּר), the roebuck. The wild goat; akko (אַקּו), the ibex. The pygarg; dishon (דִישׁון), some kind of antelope, probably the Gazella Dorcas. The wild ox; the'o (תְאו), probably the bubale, or wild cow of the Arabs (Alcephalus bubalis), a species of antelope.

This word occurs only here, and it is supposed by some that, by an error of the copyist, substituting ר for ד, it has come instead of דָאָה, as used in Leviticus 11:14. But it is more probable, as above suggested, that the da'ah of Leviticus is represented by the dayyah of Deuteronomy, and that consequently the reading raah should be re-rained. This word, derived from רָאָה, to see, to look, would appropriately designate a bird of keen sight, one of the hawk species. The bird intended may be a buzzard, of which there are now several kinds in Palestine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every raven after his kind,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut of all clean fowls ye may eat.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God.

Verse 22. - Thy seed. \"Seed\" here refers to plants as well as what is raised from seed (cf. Jeremiah 2:21; Ezekiel 17:5, 6). The reference is to the second or festival tithe which was exclusively of vegetables.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - In the land of Canaan, as the people would be dispersed over a wide tract, it might happen that the place which the Lord should choose was at such a distance from the usual residence of many that to observe this injunction would be to them very difficult, if not impossible. To meet this, therefore, it was enacted that the tithe might be commuted into money, and with this the things required for the sacrificial meals at the sanctuary might be purchased.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Strong drink; shecar (שֵׁכַר). \"Any drink which can inebriate, whether that is made from grain, or the juice of apples, or when honey is boiled into a sweet and barbarous potion, or the fruit of the palm [dates], is expressed into liquor, and the duller water is colored by the prepared fruits\" (Jerome, 'De Vit.

The end of three years; i.e. as the third year expired, consequently, in the last year of the triennium (Deuteronomy 26:12); just as \"the end of seven years\" means each seventh year (Deuteronomy 15:1; Deuteronomy 31:10; Jeremiah 34:14). This was not an additional tithe, but the former differently applied; the tithe of the first and second years was to be eaten before the Lord at the sanctuary; the tithe of the third year was for the poor and needy.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy14:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Deut.15":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Release. The word thus rendered (שְׁמִטָּה, from שָׁמַט, to leave, to let lie fallow) occurs only here and in ver. 2; in Exodus 33:11 the cognate verb is used, and from this the word is best explained. The debt was to be left in the hands of the debtor, as the land was to be let lie or left untilled for that year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Creditor; literally, master of the loan of his hand, equivalent to owner of what his hand has lent to another. Comp. the expression, \"what was laid in his hand\" (Leviticus 5:21; Authorized Version, \"in fellowship,\" Leviticus 6:2); and Nehemiah 10:32, \"the debt of every hand\" (Authorized Version, \"the exaction of every debt\"). Neighbor; here, fellow-Israelite. Exact it of his neighbor; literally, press or urge his neighbor, i.e. to pay. It is called the Lord's release; rather, a release for Jehovah is proclaimed; the sabbatical year, like the year of jubilee, was proclaimed, and it was for Jehovah, in his honor, and in accordance with his ordinance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - A foreigner; a stranger of another nation, having no internal social relation to Israel (נָכְרִי), as distinguished from the stranger who lived among them and had claims on their benevolence (גֵּר). Of such they might exact a debt, without regard to the year of release. \"This rule breathes no hatred of foreigners, but simply allows the Israelites the right of every creditor to demand his debts and enforce the demand upon foreigners, even in the sabbatical year.

The reason assigned is that the Lord would greatly bless them in the land which he had given them, so that the creditor would be no loser by refraining from exacting his debt from his brother in the seventh year.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - This blessing, though promised and certified, should come only if they were careful to observe and do all that God commanded them. The for at the beginning of ver. 6 connects this with ver. 4. Thou shalt lend. The verb in Kal signifies to borrow on a pledge; in Hiph. to lend on a pledge, as here; it is a denominative from the Hebrew noun signifying pledge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-11. - The reference to the release leads to a prescription regarding readiness to lend to the poor. They were not to harden their hearts against their poorer brethren, nor were they, in the prospect of the year of release, to refuse to lend them what was necessary for their uses, but, on the contrary, were to open their heart and their hand to them according to their need, lest the poor should appeal against them to God, and sin should lie upon them. Verse 7. - Harden thine heart; literally, maize strong, so as to suppress natural compassion and sympathy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth; literally, the sufficiency of his need which he needeth, i.e. whatever he might need to meet his requirements.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A thought in thy wicked heart; literally, a thing in thy heart worthlessness, i.e. a thing which is worthless and unworthy. The word used is belial (בְּלִיַּעַל), which does not denote that which is wicked so much as that which is worthless. Thus, \"a man of Belial\" is a worthless fellow - not necessarily a wicked man (cf. Deuteronomy 13:13). And it be sin unto thee; i.e. entail guilt upon thee, and so expose thee to the Divine displeasure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Shall not be grieved; literally, shall not become evil, i.e. shall not entertain a grudge. They were to give, not grudgingly or of necessity, merely through dread of God's displeasure, but cheerfully and spontaneously (cf. 2 Corinthians 9:7). For this God would bless them in all their works, so that they should not only be no losers, but should be gainers, by their generosity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They were to open their hand wide to their poorer brethren, for there should always be such in the land. This statement is not inconsistent with that in ver. 4, for there it is the prevention of poverty by not dealing harshly with the poor that is spoken of; here it is the continuance of occasion for the relief of the poor that is referred to.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-18. - From injunctions regarding the treatment of the poor and of debtors the transition is easy to the law concerning slaves, inasmuch as it was through the stress of poverty that any became such from among their brethren. The law, as here laid down, is the same as that in Exodus 21:2-6, somewhat expanded; the most important addition being that the slave is not only to go free after six years of service, but is to be furnished by his master with the means of setting up a home for himself. The six years here specified are not to be confounded with the years ending at the sabbatical year; they are any six years during which the individual has been in bondage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Thou shalt furnish him liberally; literally, shalt lay on his neck, i.e. thou shalt load him. The meaning is well expressed in the Authorized Version. This is the new prescription added to the earlier law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Compliance is enforced by the consideration that the Israelites had been themselves bondmen in Egypt, and had been redeemed out of that bondage by God (cf. Deuteronomy 5:15; Deuteronomy 10:19; Deuteronomy 16:12; Deuteronomy 24:18, 22; Exodus 22:20; Exodus 23:9; Leviticus 19:34). As God had dealt by them, so it behooved them to deal by others in like condition and need.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - It might happen, however, that the slave chose rather to remain with his master than to be manumitted, and in that case he was not to be forced to go free, which would be a hardship to him, but was to be, by a formal process of nailing his ear to the door of his master's house, constituted his slave for life (cf. Exodus 21:5). This was not a painful operation, especially as the servant's ear was probably already pierced for a ring; nor does any infamy appear to have been attached to the bearing of this badge of perpetual servitude. There is no mention here, as in Exodus, of the matter being referred to the judges; and this has led some to suppose that, by the time this later prescription was given, the earlier usage had passed away; but it is more natural to suppose that this usage was so regular and well known that it was needless formally to announce it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever.

It is enjoined that, as all the firstborn were to be sanctified to the Lord (Exodus 13:2-13), they were not to work with the firstborn of their cattle, either by yoking the bullock to the plough or wagon or by shearing the sheep: these belonged to God, and were not to be put to any vulgar uses of men; year by year they were to be brought to the sanctuary, offered as sacrifices, and eaten before the Lord. If any of the firstborn animals were blind, or lame, or in any way blemished, such was not to be offered to the Lord, but might be used as food in their ordinary places of residence (cf. Leviticus 22:19, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy15:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Deut.16":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTObserve the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1, 2. - The month of Abib (cf. Exodus 41:2; 23. 15). The time is referred to as a date well known to the people. Keep the passover; make (עַשִׂיתָ) or prepare the passover. This injunction refers primarily to the preparation of the Paschal lamb for a festal meal (Numbers 9:5); but here it is used in a wider sense as referring to the whole Paschal observance, which lasted for seven days. Hence the mention of sheep (צאֹן) and oxen (בְקָר) in ver. 2, and the reference to the eating of unleavened bread for seven days \"therewith,\" i.e. with the Passover. The animal for the Paschal supper was expressly prescribed to be a yearling of the sheep or of the goats (שֶׂה), and this was to be consumed at one meal; but on the other days of the festival the flesh of other animals offered in sacrifice might be eaten. The term \"Passover\" here, accordingly, embraces the whole of the festive meals connected with the Passover proper - what the rabbins call chagigah (Maimon., in 'Kor-ban Pesach,' c. 10. § 12; cf. 2 Chronicles 35:7, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Bread of affliction; bread such as is prepared in circumstances of trial and pressure, when there is no time or opportunity for the application of all the means required for the preparation of bread of the better sort. The Israelites had in haste and amid anxiety to prepare the Passover meal on the evening of their flight from Egypt, and so had to omit the leavening of their bread; and this usage they had to observe during the seven days of the festival in subsequent times, to remind them of the oppression the nation had suffered in Egypt, and the circumstances of difficulty and peril amidst which their deliverance had been effected.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - No leavened bread; properly, no leaven (שְׂאֹר) (cf. Exodus 12:15). Not only was no leavened bread (מַצָּה) or dough (חָמֵץ) to be used by them, leaven itself was not to be in the house (cf. 1 Corinthians 5:7; see Kitto's 'Cyclop. of Bibl. Lit.,' vol. 3. p. 429).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - Not in their own houses or places of abode might the Paschal lamb be slain and eaten, but only at the place, which the Lord should choose to place his Name there. On the first occasion, while the people were still in Egypt and had no sanctuary or specially holy place where Jehovah s Name was set, the Passover was eaten in their own houses; but when God should choose a place as his sanctuary, only there could the ordinance be observed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Thou shalt roast. The verb here primarily signifies to be matured by heat for eating; hence to be ripened as by the sun's heat (Genesis 40:10; Joel 3:13; Hebrews 4:13); and to be cooked, whether by boiling, seething, or roasting. Here it is properly rendered by roast, as it was thus only that the Paschal lamb could be cooked. And go unto thy tents; return to thy place of abode; not necessarily to thy proper home (which might be far distant), but to the place where for the time thou hast thy lodging. The phrase, \"thy tents,\" which originally came into use while as yet Israel had no settled abodes in Canaan, came afterwards to be used as a general designation of a man's home or usual place of abode (cf. 1 Samuel 13:2; 2 Samuel 20:1; 1 Kings 8:66, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - On the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly. This is not placed in antithesis to the injunction, six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as if the Feast of Unleavened Bread (mazzoth) lasted only for six days and the seventh was to be devoted to a service of a different kind; it simply prescribes that the seventh day of the festival was to be celebrated by an assembling of the whole of those who had come to the feast; the festival was to be wound up with a day of holy convocation, in which no work was to be done (Leviticus 23:36). On all the days unleavened bread was to be eaten, and on the seventh there was besides to be a solemn assembly to the Lord (עֲצֶרֶת לַיחוָח), called in Leviticus 23:36, \"a holy convocation\" (מִקְרָא קֹדֶשׁ).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-12. - The Feast of Weeks (cf. Exodus 23:16). Verse 9. - From such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn; i.e. from the commencement of the corn harvest. The seven weeks were to be counted from this terminus; and as the corn harvest began by the presentation of the sheaf of the firstfruits on the second day of the Passover, this regulation as to time coincides with that in Leviticus 23:15.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - This feast was to be kept with sacrificial gifts according to the measure of the free-will offerings of their hand, i.e. voluntary offerings which they gave as the Lord had blessed them; nothing was specially prescribed, each was to give of his own free-will as the Lord had prospered him. The word translated \"tribute\" in the Authorized Version (מִסַּת) occurs only here, and is of doubtful signification. The LXX. render it by καθὼς, as, according to; it is identical with the Aramaic מסת sufficiency, enough, and may be understood here of the full measure according to which their offerings were to be presented. The freewill offering of thine hand, here referred to, belonged to the gifts of burnt offerings, meat offerings, drink offerings, and thank offerings which might be offered at every feast along with the sacrifices prescribed (cf. Leviticus 23:38; Numbers 29:39). Of the latter no mention is made here, as the law regarding them was already sufficiently proclaimed (Numbers 28, and 29.); and in a popular address it was rather to what depended on the will of the people than to what was imperative by law, that attention had to be directed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Rejoice before the Lord. \"The expression, to rejoice before the Lord, denotes here nothing else than to honor him by sacred songs; comp. Spencer, 'De Legg. Hebrews Ritual.,' p. 881, edit. 3\" (Havernick, 'Introd.,' p. 157).

Leviticus 23:33-44; Numbers 29:12-38). This feast was to be observed at the end of harvest, after the corn had been gathered into granaries, and the produce of the vineyard had been put through the press. Nothing is added here to the instructions already given respecting this festival; only the observance of it at the appointed sanctuary is enforced, and stress is laid on their making not only their sons and daughters and domestics, but also the Levite, the fatherless, the widow, and the stranger participators in their rejoicings. Thou shalt surely rejoice; rather, thou shalt be wholly joyous; literally, rejoicing only; Rosenm., \"adnodum laetus.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSeven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThree times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - (Cf. Exodus 23:17; Exodus 34:23.) The law is repeated here with the additional clause, \"at the place which the Lord shall choose;\" and the words, \"not empty,\" are explained to mean with gifts according to the gift of their hands, according to the blessing of Jehovah their God, which he had given them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEvery man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJudges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - Moses had at an earlier period appointed judges to settle disputes among the people, and had given instructions to them for the discharge of their duty (Exodus 18; Deuteronomy 1:12-18). Whilst the people were in the wilderness, united as one body and under the leadership of Moses, this arrangement was sufficient; but a more extended arrangement would be required when they came to be settled in Canaan and dispersed in towns and villages over the whole land. In prospect of this, Moses here enacts that judges and officers were to be appointed by the people in all their gates, in all their places of residence, which the Lord should give them. Verse 18. - Judges and officers. The \"officers\" (shoterim, writers) associated with the judges both in the earlier arrangements and in that which was to succeed were secretaries and clerks of court, and acted also as assessors and advisers of the judges. No instruction is given as to the number of judges and officers, or as to the mode of appointing them; nor was this necessary. The former would be determined by the size and population of the place where they were appointed, and the latter would, as a matter of course, follow the method instituted by Moses in the earlier arrangement (see Deuteronomy 1:13-15; Exodus 18:21-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - (Cf.

Pervert the words [margin, matters] of the righteous; rather, the case or the cause of the righteous.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - That which is altogether just; literally, justice, justice. The repetition of the word is for the sake of emphasis, as in Genesis 14:10, \"pits, pits,\" equal to full of pits.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - In all states, the highest crime of which the judge has to take note is that of treason against the supreme Rower; and, under the theocracy, the act most distinctly treasonable was idolatry. In proceeding, therefore, to give some practical admonitions as to the things to be observed in the administration of justice, Moses begins by denouncing and forbidding this most flagrant form of iniquity. Verse 21. - Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees; thou shalt not plant, i.e. place or set up, an asherah of any wood. The asherah was an idol of wood in the form of a pillar, usually placed by the side of the altars of Baal. It was the symbol of Astarte, the great Canaanitish goddess, the companion and revealer of Baal. The two are usually associated in the Old Testament (cf. Judges 2:13; Judges 6:28; 1 Kings 18:19; 2 Kings 23:4). The rendering \"grove\" has been taken from the LXX. and the Vulgate; but that it is an error is evident from 1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 17:10; and Jeremiah 17:2; where the asherah is said to be under a green tree; and from the use of such words as make, set up, cause to stand, build, to denote the action of producing an asherah (cf. 1 Kings 14:15; 1 Kings 16:33; 2 Kings 17:16; 2 Kings 17:10; 2 Chronicles 33:19; 1 Kings 14:23), none of which are appropriate to the planting of a grove. Here, indeed, the word \"plant\" is used, but this is only because, as the asherah was sunk in the earth that it might stand firm, it might be figuratively said to be planted, just as nails driven in are said to be planted (Ecclesiastes 12:11, where the same verb is used; comp. also Isaiah 51:16; Amos 9:15; Daniel 11:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy16:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Any image; any pillar, etc. The Hebrew word (מַצֵבָה, mazzebah) denotes generally any pillar or stone that is set up, whether as a memorial (Genesis 28:18), or as a sign (Exodus 24:4; Isaiah 19:19), or for purposes of utility or ornament (Jeremiah 43:13). Here, as in other passages, it is a pillar or statue set up as an object of worship (cf. 2 Kings 3:2; 2 Kings 10:26; Hosea 10:1; Micah 5:12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Deut.17":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Not only was the setting up of idols an offence to be punished by the judge, but also all profanation of the service of Jehovah, such as the offering in sacrifice of any animal, bullock or sheep, that had any blemish or defect (cf.

Here he declares what is to be done to those who are so seduced. Done wickedness; literally, done the evil. The definite article is prefixed; it is not any kind of wickedness that is here denounced, but the special sin of idolatry, the wickedness κατ ἐξόχην. All idolatry was to be strictly suppressed - those convicted of it to be put to death by stoning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - (Cf.

Worthy of death be put to death; i.e. adjudged or appointed to death; literally, the dead man shall die. מֵת, the part. of מוּת, to die, is here equivalent to בֶּן מָוֶת, son of death (1 Samuel 20:31), or אִישׁ מָוֶת, a man of death (1 Kings 2:26), i.e. one assigned to death, already the property of death, and so as good as dead. Put the evil away; literally, consume or sweep away the evil. The verb בָּעַר means primarily to consume by burning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people.

But, as he was not to be always with them, it was needful to provide a supreme court, to which such cases might be carried when they could no longer be decided by him; and such a court is here appointed to be held at the sanctuary. Verse 8. - A matter too hard for thee; literally, too marvelous; something extraordinary, and which could not be decided by the ordinary rules of the judicature. Between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke; i.e. in cases where blood had been shed and death had ensued, either accidentally or from murderous intent (cf. Exodus 21:13, etc.; Numbers 35:9, etc.); in cases of disputed rights and claims (cf. 2 Chronicles 19:10); and in cases where corporeal injury had been suffered, whether in strife or from assault (Exodus 21:18, etc.); and, in general, wherever matters of controversy - disputes as to what was lawful and right, might arise in their towns and villages. In all such cases recourse was to be had to the court at the sanctuary - \"to the priests the Levites,\" i.e. the priests who were of the tribe of Levi, and to the judge presiding there - the lay judge associated with the high priest as president (see Oehler, in Herzog's 'Encyclop.,' vol. 5. p. 58). It is not intended by this that an appeal was to lie from the lower court to the higher, or that the parties in a suit might carry it at once to the supreme judge; the meaning rather is that, when the ordinary judges found a case too difficult for them to deal with, they were themselves to transmit it to the supreme court for decision.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Enquire; what, namely, is \"the sentence of judgment;\" and this the judge should declare.

If any through pride or arrogance should refuse to accept the interpretation of the Law given by the priests, or to submit to the sentence pronounced by the judge, he was to be regarded as a rebel against God, and to be put to death, that others might be deterred from the like presumption (Deuteronomy 13:11). The sentence, which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall show thee; rather, which they shall declare to thee from that place which the Lord shall choose.

In case, then, of their coming to desire to have a king over them like the nations around them, Moses gives instructions here as to the choice of a king, and as to the duties and obligations resting upon those who might be elevated to that office. The form in which these are conveyed clearly indicates that, at the time this was uttered, the existence of a king in Israel was contemplated as only a distant possibility. Verse 14. - When thou art come unto the land, etc. This phraseology, which is common to the laws which respect the affairs of the Hebrews after they should be settled in Canaan, implies that this law was given whilst they were yet outside the Promised Land. It is plain also, from the tenor of the whole statement in this verse, that the legislator in this case is providing for what he supposes may happen, is likely to happen, but which he by no means desires should happen. Moses foresaw that the people would wish to be as the nations around them - governed by a king - and he legislates accordingly, without approving of that wish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The prohibition to choose a foreigner indicates that the people had the right of election. In what way this was to be exercised, and how it was subject to the Divine choice, is not declared. Judging from what actually happened in subsequent history, it would appear that only on special occasions, such as the election of the first king or a change of dynasty, did God take the initiative, and through a prophet direct the choice of the people; ultimately the monarchy became hereditary, and it was understood that the prince who succeeded to the throne did so with the Divine approval, unless the opposite was expressly intimated by a message from God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - Certain rules are prescribed for the king. It is forbidden to him to multiply horses, to multiply wives, and to amass large treasures of silver and gold, and he must have a copy of the Law written out for him from that kept by the priests, that he might have it by him, and read it all the days of his life. The multiplying of horses is prohibited, because this would bring Israel into intercourse and friendly relations with Egypt, and might tend to their going back to that country from which they had been so marvelously delivered; a prohibition which could only have been given at an early stage in the history of the people, for at a later period, after they had been well established in Canaan, such a prohibition for such a reason would have been simply ridiculous. The prohibition to multiply wives and to amass large treasures has respect to the usage common from the earliest period with Oriental monarchs to have vast harems and huge accumulations of the precious metals, as much for ostentation as for either luxury or use; and as there was no small danger of the King of Israel being seduced to follow this usage, and so to have his heart turned away from the Lord, it was fitting that such a prohibition should be prospectively enacted for his guidance. Both these prohibitions were neglected by Solomon, and probably by others of the Jewish kings; but this only indicates that the law was so ancient that it had come in their time to be regarded as obsolete. The rule that the king was to write him a copy of the Law for his own constant use does not necessarily imply that he was to write this with his own hand; he might cause it to be written by some qualified scribe for him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy17:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - A copy of this law; literally, a double of this Law, i.e. not, as the LXX. have it, \"This reiteration of the Law\" (τὸ δευτερονόμιον τοῦτο), but a duplicate or copy of the Pentateuchal Law. The Jews understand by \"double\" that two copies of the Law were to be made by the king (Maimon., ' De Regibus,' e. 3. § 1); but this is unnecessary: every copy of a law is a double of it.

They shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire. \"The offerings of the Lord made by fire\" (literally, the fires or firings of Jehovah), here referred to, were the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass effusing (cf.

These were regarded as the choice parts of the animal, and were to be given to the priests in addition to the wave breast and heave leg of the peace offerings (Leviticus 7:32, etc.; Numbers 18:11), which belonged to the firings of Jehovah, mentioned in ver. 1. To these the priest had a rightful claim; they were his due (מִשְׁפַט, mishpat, right). \"This right was probably accorded to the priests as a compensation for the falling off which would take place in their incomes in consequence of the repeal of the law that every animal was to be slaughtered at the sanctuary as a sacrifice (Leviticus 17; vide Deuteronomy 12:15. sqq.)\"(Keil). According to Josephus ('Antiq ,' 4:4, 4), Philo ('De Praemiis. Sacerdot.,' p. 832, Opp., tom. 2. p. 235, edit. Maugey), the Talmud, etc., this injunction relates to the slaying of animals at home for private use, and not such as were killed for sacrifice. But the use here of the sacrificial phraseology, who offer a sacrifice (זֹבְחֵי הַזֶּבַח, who slay victims for sacrifice - a phrase nowhere found except in connection with sacrificial rites) is adverse to this; and besides, how could such an enactment be carried out? How could people, residing at a distance, convey to the priests the portions due to them every time they slaughtered an animal for domestic use? At the same time, the sacrifices here referred to do not seem to be included in the offerings by fire above mentioned; and these gifts to the priest seem to have been something over and above his ordinary dues. There is probability, therefore, in the suggestion that \"the reference is to the slaughtering of oxen, sheep, or goats, which were not intended for shelamim in the more limited sense, i.e. for one of the three species of peace offerings (Leviticus 7:15, 16), but for festal meals in the broader sense, which were held in connection with the sacrificial meals prepared from the shelamim\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - In addition to the firstfruits already prescribed by the Law to be given to the priests (Numbers 18:12, 13), Moses here enacts that the first fleece of the sheep shall be given.

In this respect his place could be supplied neither by priest nor by king. In the prospect of his demise, therefore, there required to be instituted another office, that of a prophet, one who should be between God and the people, as the channel through which Divine communications might pass to them. This office Moses here announces that God would establish among them when they had entered the Promised Land. Verse 9. - The abominations of these nations; i.e. certain forms of superstitious usage by which the heathen sought to procure the favor of their deities, to obtain from them direction and counsel, and to penetrate into the hidden future of events. Moses charges the people to avoid all such usages, and not even to learn to do after such abominations (cf.

That useth divination (cf. Ezekiel 21:21, where the different methods of divination are enumerated). An observer of times. This is according to the Targum, observans horns; the LXX. have κληδονιζόμενος, \"one who augurs what is to happen;\" Vulgate, qui observat somnia atque auguria. The word (מְעונֵן) is part of a verb which signifies to cover, to use covert arts, to practice sorcery; though some derive it from the noun עָנַן, a thick cloud, and explain it as \"interpreter of clouds;\" while others trace it to עַיִן, the eye, and explain it as \"one who cheats by optical fascinations\" (so the Syriac, fascinans oculis), or one who divines by inspection - an augur.\" An enchanter; one who practices magic, or divines by signs (cf. Genesis 44:5; Numbers 24:1). It is sometimes said that the verb of which this word is a part (נִחֵשׁ) is a denominative from נָחָשׁ, a serpent; whence it is inferred that the species of divination indicated by this word is ophiomancy, or divination by serpents, but this is not generally accepted by scholars. A witch (מִכַשֵׁפ; LXX., φαρμακός: Vulgate, maleficus); probably one who pretended to cure diseases, or procure some desired result, by means of nostrums and philtres. In the enumeration of the wise men of Babylon (Daniel 2:2), the Mecashephim have a place beside the Hartummim, and in Genesis 41:8 and Exodus 7:11, they are joined with the Hachamim or Magi of Egypt; and this favors the conclusion that their sorcery had a quasi-scientific basis. The English word \"witch\" is now restricted to the female practicer of unlawful arts; formerly it was applied to males as well, if not chiefly (Trench, 'Select Glossary,' p. 806). A charmer (חֹבֵר הָבֶר); a dealer in spells, one who by means of spells or charms pretends to achieve some desired result. The verb here used primarily means to bind, and the species of magic indicated is probably that practiced by binding certain knots, whereby it was supposed that the curse or blessing, as the case might he, was bound on its object; this was accompanied apparently with incantation (Psalm 58:5). Comp. English spell-bound, and the phrase, \"to rivet charms\" (Jonson, 'Sad Shepherd,' 2:2). A species of incantation known to the Romans consisted in tying knots with threads of different colors, three in number, which were supposed to become a bond to secure an object (cf. Virg., 'Eclog.' 8:76, 77). A consulter with familiar spirits. This phrase conveys something different from what is expressed, in the Hebrew. שֹׂאֵל אוב is one who asks or inquires of an Ob, that is, a Python, or divining spirit. This spirit was supposed to be in the person of the conjurer, and to be able to reveal to him what was secret or hidden in the future (Leviticus 20:27; 1 Samuel 28:7, 8; Acts 16:16). The notion of \"a familiar spirit,\" i.e. a spirit not dwelling in the person, but with which he is intimate - generally the spirit of one who formerly lived on earth - is a modern notion not known to Scripture. The persons here referred to were probably ventriloquists (LXX., ἐγγαστρίμυθοι), and used their faculty in this respect for purposes of magic, pretending that they had within them a spirit which they could consult, and by which they could predict what would happen or reveal what was hid. Wizard. The English word \"wizard\" did not originally convey the idea of anything evil in the person of whom it was used; Milton applies it to the Magi who came to worship at Bethlehem ('Ode on the Nativity,' 4.); it meant merely \"the wise one,\" or \"the knowing one;\" and thus is an exact equivalent for the Hebrew word here used (יְדעֹנִי, knowing, wise, from יָדַע, to know). A necromancer; one who professed to call up the dead, and from them to learn the secrets of futurity (cf. 1 Samuel 28:7).

They are connected here with the Moloch-worship, because of the intimate relation between idolatry and the use of magical arts; and Moloch-worship is specially mentioned, probably because it was the form of idolatry with which the Israelites were most likely to come in contact, both where they then were and also in Canaan; not, as Keil suggests, because that form \"was more intimately connected with soothsaying and magic than any other description of idolatry\" - an assertion for which there is no evidence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God. The word translated \"per-feet\" properly means entire, whole, answering to the Latin integer; it is used only in a moral sense, and is best rendered by \"upright;\" the Israelites were to be upright and sincere with, i.e. in relation with, Jehovah their God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Though the heathen whose land they were to possess sought to diviners and enchanters, Israel was not to do so; as for them (the אַתָּה at the beginning of the clause is an emphatic nominative), Jehovah their God had not suffered (נָתַן, given, granted, allowed) them to do such things.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-22. - There should be no need for Israel to turn to heathen soothsayers, or diviners, or such like, because from amongst themselves, of their own brethren, would God raise up prophets like unto Moses, who, as occasion required, would reveal to them what God willed them to know. Verse 15. - A Prophet. The Hebrew word so rendered (נָבִיא) is a derivative from a verb (נָבָא), which signifies to tell, to announce; hence the primary concept of the word is that of announcer, or forth-speaker; and to this the word \"prophet\" (Greek προφήτης from πρόφημι, I speak before or in place of) closely corresponds; the prophet is one who speaks in the place of God, who conveys God's word to men, who is an interpreter of God to men. (As illustrative of the meaning of the word, cf. Exodus 7:1; Exodus 4:16.) Hence Abraham is called a prophet (Genesis 20:7), and the term is applied to the patriarchs generally (Psalm 105:15); God conveyed his mind to them, and they spoke it forth to others (cf. Amos 3:7). Like unto me. When the people heard the voice of God speaking to them at Sinai, and from the midst of the fire uttering to them the Ten Words, they were struck with terror, and besought that they might not again hear that awful voice, but that Moses might act as mediator between God and them - might hear what God should say, and speak it unto them (Deuteronomy 5:22-27). Moses thus became God's prophet to the people; and of this he reminds them here, as well as of the circumstances amid which he entered specially on this office (cf. vers. 16, 17). The phrase, \"like unto me,\" does not necessarily imply that the prophet who was to come after Moses was to be in every respect the same as he; all that is indicated is that he would act as Moses had acted as a mediator between God and the people in the way of conveying his will to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAccording to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - In the day of the assembly (cf.

The question has been raised whether, by the Prophet like unto Moses, here promised to the people of Israel, is to be understood some eminent individual, or whether this refers to the prophetic διαδοχὴ, or succession, that was to continue under the theocracy. For the latter the context strongly speaks, forNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the contrast between what God here forbids the Israelites to do, viz. to resort to diviners and soothsayers, and the provision he would make for them so as to render this needless, point to a succession of prophets rather than to one individual;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the reference in what follows to the discrimination of false prophets from true prophets, shows that a multiplicity and a succession of prophets was in the view of the speaker, not a single individual; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) as a succession of priests, of judges, and of kings was contemplated in this part of the Mosaic legislation, the presumption is that a succession also of prophets was contemplated. At the same time, the use of the singular here is remarkable, for nowhere else is the singular, nabhi, employed to designate more than one individual; and this suggests that the reference here may be to some individual in whom not only was the succession to culminate as in its crown and eminence, but whose spirit was to pervade the whole succession, - that each member of it should exercise his functions only as that Spirit which was in them did signify (1 Peter 1:11). It is possible also, as Oryon Gerlach has suggested, that \"Prophet\" here may be used as \"seed\" is in Genesis 3:15, and that this is a prediction of Christ as the True Prophet, just as the assurance to Eve was a prediction of the Messiah, who, as the Head and Crown of the\" godly seed,\" should end the conflict with the serpent and his seed by a crushing victory. It is to be considered also that, whilst the words \"like unto me\" do not necessarily imply a resemblance in all respects between Moses and the Prophet here promised, and whilst they may be well applied to One superior in many respects to Moses, it would be taking them at much below their real worth were we to understand them of one greatly inferior to Moses, as all the prophets who succeeded him in Israel were until the Chief came (Deuteronomy 34:10; Hebrews 3:1-6). Finally, there can be no doubt that the Jews expected that the Messiah would appear as the Prophet by pre-eminence, and that they founded that expectation on the promise here recorded (cf. John 1:21; John 6:14; Acts 3:22-26; Acts 7:37). It may be added that our Lord seems to apply this to himself, when he says to the Jews, \"There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me\" (John 5:45, 46; cf. also John 11:48-50). How early and how widespread was the expectation that the Messiah would come as a prophet, may be inferred from the existence of this among the Samaritans (John 4:25). It is to be concluded, then, that this promise has reference ultimately to the Messiah, the Great Revealer of God, between whom and Moses there should be a long succession of prophets, so that there should always be a medium of Divine communication between Jehovah and his people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy18:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-22. - To the Prophet who should thus speak to the people all that God should command him, they were to pay the utmost deference, and to his words they were to render implicit obedience.

The reference here is to the prediction of proximate events - events that were to happen within a limited period, but which were not such as one not divinely instructed could foresee. When such came to pass, the pretensions of the prophet were thereby substantiated, and his authority established (cf. 1 Samuel 3:19; John 2:18, etc.).

In the East, the roads were for the most part mere tracks made by the feet of animals used as beasts of burden or for traveling; and this continues to be the case in Palestine and many other parts of the East even at the present day. That roads, however, properly so called, were not unknown to the Hebrews, even in early times, is evident, not only from this passage, but also from Leviticus 26:22; Numbers 20:17; Numbers 21:22; Deuteronomy 2:27; 1 Samuel 6:12. The design of the injunction here was that every facility should be afforded to the fugitive to escape to the place of refuge. In later times, it was enacted that the roads leading to these cities should be repaired every year in the month Adar, and every obstruction removed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-7. - (Cf.

In the earlier legislation, it is enacted that the congregation shall judge in such matters, and that by their decision it should be determined in any case whether the person who had slain another was to be allowed to remain in a city of refuge or be delivered over to the avenger of blood. With this the ordinance here is not inconsistent; the elders were not to act as judges, but merely as magistrates, to apprehend the man and bring him to trial.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - To the ordinance concerning cities of refuge Moses appends one prohibiting the removing of landmarks; if these had been placed by a man's ancestors to mark the boundaries of possessions, they were not to be surreptitiously altered. Landmarks were held sacred, and a curse is pronounced against those who remove them (Deuteronomy 27:7; cf. Job 24:2; Proverbs 22:28; Proverbs 23:10; Hosea 5:10). Among other nations also landmarks were regarded as sacred (cf. Plato, 'De Legibus,' 8. p. 842; Dionys. Halic. 2:17; Plutarch, 'Numa,' 16; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639). Verse 14. - They of old time; i.e. those of a former age (רִאשֹׁנִים, earlier ones, ancestors, predecessors). The word does not necessarily imply that the age described as \"former\" was removed at a great distance in the past; it might designate men of the immediately preceding age. The LXX. have here οἱ πατέρες, and the Vulgate priores. That the law here given was uttered whilst Israel was yet outside of Canaan, is evident from what follows in this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOne witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-21. - To secure against injury to life or property through inadequate or false attestation, it is enacted that more than one witness must appear before anything can be established; and that, should a witness be found on trial to have testified falsely against his neighbor, he was to be punished by having done to him what he thought to have done to his neighbor (cf. Deuteronomy 17:6; Numbers 35:30). Verse 15. - The rule in Deuteronomy 17:6, regarding accusations of idolatry, is here extended to accusations of every kind before a court of justice; a single witness was not to be admitted as sufficient to convict a man of any offence, either civil or criminal.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - To testify against him that which is wrong; literally, to testify against him defection, i.e. from the Law of God. The speaker has apparently in view here all such defections from the Law as would entail punishment on the convicted offender. In Deuteronomy 13:5 [6], indeed, the crime described here as \"that which is wrong\" (margin, \"falling away\") is specially the crime of apostasy to idolatry; but the word (סָרָה), though usually expressing apostasy from Jehovah, has properly the general sense of a deflection from a prescribed course (from סוּר, to go off, to go aside), and so may describe any departure from what is constituted right.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Both the men, i.e. both parties at the bar, shall stand before the Lord; i.e. shall come to the sanctuary where Jehovah had his dwelling-place in the midst of his people, and where the supreme judges, who were his delegates and representatives, held their court (Deuteronomy 17:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his brother;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy19:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Thought.

Some would render here \"Such are the words,\" and understand the expression as referring to the preceding books. But it seems more natural to refer it to what follows - to the addresses in this book. The pronoun these (אֵלֶּה) may be used with a prospective reference, as well as with a retrospective (cf. e.g. Genesis 2:4; Genesis 6:9). The author does not by this connect this book with the preceding, but rather distinguishes it. The subscription to Numbers (Numbers 36:13) indicates that what precedes is occupied chiefly with what God spake to Moses; the inscription here intimates that what follows is what Moses spake to the people. This is the characteristic of Deuteronomy. Unto all Israel. It cannot be supposed that Moses spoke to the whole multitude of the people so as to be heard by them. Hence the Jewish interpreters say that he spoke to the elders of the people, who carried his words to the people at large. This is just; for what was thus mediately communicated to the people might be fairly described as spoken to them; and we find from other passages in the Pentateuch that the phrase, \"the elders of Israel,\" in the mind of the writer, was equivalent to \"the congregation of Israel\" (comp. e.g., Exodus 12:3 with ver. 21; Leviticus 9:1 with ver. 5). But through whatever medium conveyed, it was to the people that these words were addressed; this is emphatically a book for the people. On this side Jordan. This should be On the other side or beyond Jordan, and so also in ver. 5, as in Deuteronomy 3:20, 25. The word here used (עֵבֶר) means properly something beyond, over, or across, and indicates that which, to the speaker, lies on the other side of some line or limit. When coupled with \"the Jordan,\" it usually indicates the region to the east of that river; only in one or two instances, where the speaker takes his standpoint on the east of the river, does it designate the regions to the west of Jordan (Deuteronomy 3:25; Deuteronomy 11:30) The phrase \"beyond Jordan\" seems to have been the established designation of the region east of the Jordan (cf. Ezra 4:10, and Canon Rawlinson's note there). It is this, unquestionably, which is here so designated, as what follows expressly shows. The wilderness. This term is used of any extensive district not occupied by inhabitants or subjected to culture; hence of vast prairies or pasturelands, as well as of places properly desert and desolate. It here denotes the grassy plains or downs on the east and southeast of the Jordan, in the land of Moab (ver. 5). In the plain; in the Arabah. This is properly the whole of that remarkable depression which stretches from the source of the Jordan on to Akabah, or the Ailanitic Gulf; but here it is only that part of it which extends from the south end of the Dead Sea to Allah (Deuteronomy 2:8). This part still bears the name of the 'Arabah, the northern part being known as the Ghor (Smith's 'Dictionary,' vol. 1. p. 87; Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' vol. 1. p. 178). Over against the Red sea. The name by which the Red Sea is elsewhere designated is Yam-suph (יַם־סוּפ); here only the latter word occurs, and this has led some to doubt if the Red Sea be here intended. Patrick, Rosenmüller, and others suggest that Suph denotes some place in that region, probably Suphah (Numbers 21:14, margin, Authorized Version), so called because lying at its extremity, as the verb suph, from which it comes, means, to come to an end; but it is not certain that Suphah designates a place in Numbers 21:14. The Hebrew word סוּפְה means a tempest or whirlwind; and this meaning may be assumed here, as it is by Gesenius, Keil, and others: \"Waheb [he conquered] in a storm.\" Knobel suggests that probably the pass now called Es Sufah, on the north side of the Wady Murreh - the Maleh-acrabbim (Scorpion-ascent) of Joshua 15:3 - is meant; others have suggested Zephath (Judges 1:17; comp. Numbers 14:45), and others Zuph (1 Samuel 9:5). It is probable, however, that Suph is here merely a breviloquence for Yam-suph, the Red Sea; and so all the ancient versions take it. The identification of the Yam-suph of the Old Testament with the ἐρυθρὰ θάλασσα of the Greeks, the mare erythraeum, or rubrum, of the Latins, is due to the LXX., which other versions have followed. The identification is undoubtedly correct (cf. Numbers 33:10 and 1 Kings 9:26). Yam-suph, indeed, means simply sea of weeds, and might be the name of any sea in which algae are found; but these passages clearly prove that by this the Hebrews designated the Red Sea. At what part of this sea the Israelites crossed, and the hosts of Pharaoh were submerged, is and must remain uncertain, because we know not what was the condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus. It is probable it was not at any part of what is now known as the Red Sea or Gulf of Suez. Brugsch Bey places it at that -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Serbonian bogNEWLINEBetwixt Damiata and mount Casius old,NEWLINEWhere armies whole have sunk.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Milton, 'Paradise Lost,'Bk. 2:592.) But this has not been accepted by scholars generally (see Edinburgh Review, No. 307; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 247; Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, July and October, 1880). It seems probable that originally only a marshy district lay between the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean; and somewhere in this probably the passage of the Israelites and the drowning of the Egyptians occurred. Between Paran, and Tophel, etc. This serves more fully and particularly to indicate the locality here intended; but the details present considerable difficulty. Taken in connection with the words \"over against the lied sea,\" the names here given can only be regarded as intended more precisely to indicate the region in which the Israelites had been during the forty years of their wandering. Paran: this is the name of the wilderness bordering on Idumea, where the Israelites encamped (Numbers 10:12; Numbers 12:16); the place of their encampment being Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin (Numbers 13:21, 26), which was the eastern part of the wilderness of Paran. hod. Wady Murreh. The wilderness of Paran corresponds in general outline with the desert of Et-Tih. This is a vast plateau of irregular surface stretching from the Et-Tih range northwards to the boundaries of the Holy Land, and from the Gulf of Akabah and the Wady cf. Arabah on the east to the Gulf of Suez and the Mediterranean on the west. It is described as \"a chalky formation, the chalk being covered with coarse gravel, mixed with black flints and drifting sand;\" not, however, wholly sterile: in many parts vegetation abounds, considerable portions are under cultivation, and there are evidences that it one time water was abundant there (Smith, 2:767; Kitto, 3:1077; Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 80). It is not, however, to the wilderness of Paran that the reference is in the text, but to some definite locality or spot in the region in which the Israelites then were, or which they had recently passed through. It has been suggested that the place now called Feiran, and where there are the ruins of a town, once of some importance in the early history of Christianity, is the Paran of this passage, as it apparently is the Paran of 1 Kings 11:18. But this locality at the base of Jebel Serbail is much too far west to be the Paran here referred to. More probable is the suggestion that it is the Faran mentioned by Eusebius and Jerome ('Onomast.,' s.v. Φαράν), a city to the cast (northeast) of Allah or Elath, about three days' journey (Reland, 'Palest.,' p. 556; Winer, 'Realworterbuch,' s.v. Pharan). Tophel: this name occurs only here; it is supposed to be the place now coiled Tufailah or Tafyleh, a large village of six hundred inhabitants, between Bozrah and Kerak, on the eastern slope of the mountains of Edom (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 402; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 2:570). As this is a place where the Syrian caravans are supplied with provisions, it has been conjectured that the Israelites, when at Oboth (Numbers 21:10, 11), may have resorted to it for a supply, and that it was here that they purchased meat and drink from the children of Esau (Deuteronomy 2:29). And Laban. Laban is generally identified with Libnah, the second place of encampment of the Israelites on their return from Kadesh (Numbers 33:20, 21). Knobel, however, thinks it is the place called by Ptolemy 'Αὔαρα, lying between Petra and Allah; this name, from the Arabic (he was white), having the same meaning as the Hebrew לָבָן. Hazeroth is supposed to be the place mentioned in Numbers 11:35; Numbers 12:16, from which the Israelites entered the wilderness of Paran; but as the other places here mentioned are on the east side of the Arabah, it is not probable that this Hazeroth is the same as that of Numbers, which must have been not far from Sinai, in a northerly or north-westerly direction from that mountain, probably at or near to the fountain now called El Hudherah (Wilson, 'Lands of the Bible,' 1:235; Kitto, 'Cyclopedia,' 2:243). There were probably several places bearing the name of Hazeroth, i.e. villages. Dizahab. This is generally identified with Dhahab, a place on a tongue of land in the Gulf of Akabah. But it is extremely improbable that the Israelites ever were at this place, the approach to which is exceedingly difficult; and the mere resemblance of the names Dizahab and Dhahab is not sufficient to prove the identity of the places. There were probably more places than one which were named from zahab (gold) in the region traversed by the Israelites. There is a Dhahab on the east of the Jordan near the Zerka or Jabbok, a double mound, which is said to derive its name from the yellowish color of the sandstone rock of which it consists, and which is metalliferous. In the Arabic of the Polyglot, Dizahab appears as Dhi-dhahab, which signifies \"auro praeditum vel ab auro dictum; nam דו vel די, apud Arabes in compositione nominum propr. idem est ac Hebrews בַעל (J. H. Michaelis). There is a various reading here, Di-waheb, and this has been supposed to connect this place with the Waheb of Numbers 21:14. But, as above noted, it is by no means certain that Waheb is there the name of a place; it may, as Bishop Patrick suggests, be that of a man, some hero or chief, who was conquered in Sufah or in a storm. Waheb is a name among the Arabs. The maternal grandfather of Me-hammed had this name (Abul-Pharaj, 'Hist. Dynast.,' p. 161, edit. Pococke, Oxen., 1663); and the sect of the Wahabees take their name from Abdul Wahab, a fanatic who appeared about the beginning of last century. The words \"between Paran and Tophel\" have been taken to indicate' the termini of the wanderings; at the commencement of these the people were at Paran, and towards the close of them they were at Tophel. '\"Looking from the steppes of Moab over the ground that the Israelites had traversed, Suph, where they first entered the desert of Arabia, would lie between Paran where the congregation arrived at the borders of Canaan toward the west, and Tophel where they first ended their desert wanderings thirty-seven years later on the east\" (Keil). But this assumes that Paran here is the wilderness of Paran.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Horeb. The name generally given to Sinai in Deuteronomy (see introduction, § 4). Sinai, however, occurs in Deuteronomy 33:2 of this book. By the way of mount Seir, i.e. by the way that leads to Mount Seir; just as in Deuteronomy 2:1, \"the way of the Red sea\" is the way that leads to that sea (see also Numbers 14:25). Mount is here, as often elsewhere, for mountain range. The mountain range here referred to seems to have been, not that on the east of the 'Arabah, but what is in vers. 6 and 19 called \"the mountain of the Amorites,\" \"the Seir by Hormah\" of ver. 44, i e. the southern part of what was afterwards called the mountains of Judah. According to ver. 19, the Israelites, when they left Horeb, passed through the wilderness along the way that led to the mountains of the Amorites, and came to Kadesh-barnea. Kadesh must, therefore, be looked for, not on the eastern side of the 'Arabah, but somewhere in the wilderness of Zin. It has been identified with the place now known as 'Ain Kudes, near the northern extremity of Jebel Halal, and to the east of that hill; but this is far from being certain. Moses reminds the Israelites that the distance between Horeb and Kadesh is eleven days - i.e., about one hundred and sixty-five miles, the day's journey being reckoned at fifteen miles - not to give them a piece of information, but rather to suggest to them how, in consequence of rebellion, a journey which might have been so easily accomplished, had been protracted through many wearisome years.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - Here is intimated the time when the following addresses were delivered to the people. It was on the first day of the eleventh month in the fortieth year; therefore near the end of their wanderings, and towards the close of the lawgiver's own career. He could thus speak to them according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them, i.e. in accordance with the legislative contents of the preceding books (comp. Deuteronomy 4:5 23; 5:28-33; 6:1). It was also after the destruction of Sihon and 'Og (Numbers 21:21-35). This also is significant. By the destruction of these kings, who sought to bar the access of the Israelites to the Promised Land, God had given proof that he would indeed fulfill his promise to his people, and had at once laid them under obligations to obedience, and given them encouragement to go forward on the course to which he had called them. The \"he\" here is Moses, who, at the command of God, had led the Israelites against Sihon and 'Og. Edrei, hod Draa (Numbers 21:33) was the second capital of 'Og; he \"reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei\" (Joshua 13:12). Here, however, it denotes the place where he was slain in battle, and the words \"in Edrei\" are to be referred to the verb \"smote\" and not to \"dwelt\" (cf. Deuteronomy 3:1: Numbers 21:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAfter he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOn this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The locality is again described as beyond Jordan (see on ver. 1), and in the land of Moab. This designates the region elsewhere called Arboth Moab - the Plains of Moab (Numbers 22:1; Deuteronomy 34:1, etc.), the region on the east of the Jordan, opposite to Jericho, now known as the region of Kerak (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 377, etc.; Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,\" 2:569). Began; rather set himself to. The Hebrew word signifies to undertake, to betake one's self to, and so to begin It is variously rendered in the Authorized Version (comp. Genesis 18:27, \"taken it upon me;\" Exodus 2:21, \"was content,\" had made up his mind; 1 Samuel 12:22, \"it pleased;\" 17:39,\"assayed,\" etc.). To declare, i.e. make clear, explain, expound (Habakkuk 2:2, \"make plain \"). The Hebrew word here used (בָאַר) signifies primarily to cut or dig, then to cut into, to grave, and then to cut or dig out so as to make evident, to declare, to make plain. What Moses set himself to do, then, was not to publish a new law, but to make plain to the people the Law already promulgated, to set forth clearly and pointedly what they were required by the Law to be and to do. This explains more fully the \"spake\" (דִבֶּר) of ver. 3. This exposition of the Law was designed specially for the sake of those who, at the time the Law was first promulgated, either were not born or were incapable of understanding it (Grotius). The expression used by Moses plainly indicates that this book was not intended to furnish a second code of laws different from the former, but simply to explain and enforce what had before been enjoined.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - With this verse begins Moses' first address to the people, which extends to the end of Deuteronomy 4. It is of an introductory character, and is occupied chiefly with a retrospective survey of the events that had occurred during the forty years of their wanderings. By this Moses reminded the people how God had fulfilled his promises to them, and at the same time, how they had by their rebellion drawn down on them his displeasure, which had caused their wanderings to be so much more protracted than they would otherwise have been. Verses 6-8. - The Lord's command to depart from Horeb, and his promise to the people. Verse 6. - The Lord our God - Jehovah our God. The use of this epithet implies the covenant union of Israel with Jehovah, and presupposes the existence of that covenant which was entered into at Sinai. In Horeb. This was the starting-point, so to speak, of Israel's being as the special people of God - his segullah (סְגֻּלָּה, Exodus 19:5), his special treasure. There he made himself known to them as Jehovah, the Eternal and Unchangeable, and entered into covenant with them; and there they received that Law, on the keeping of which depended their retention of the privileges to which they had been elected. At Horeb the Israelites had remained for about a year (comp. Exodus 19. I and Numbers 10:11, 12), and as the purpose for which they had been brought thither was answered, they were enjoined to move, not indeed by express command, but by the rising of the cloud from over the tabernacle, which was the signal of their march (Numbers 9:15, etc.; Numbers 10:11-13), preceded by the instructions they had received preparatory to their removal (Numbers 50:4-7). Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount. The Israelites remained at Sinai from the third month of the first year to the twentieth day of the second year after they came out of Egypt (cf. Exodus 19:1 and Numbers 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all that dwell thereon; literally, its dwellers or inhabitants (שְׁכֵנָיו). The mountain range of the Amorites, afterwards called the hill country of Judah and Ephraim, was the object which would first strike the view of one advancing from the south; and so, it stands here for the whole land of Canaan, with which it is in this context identified. Those \"that dwell thereon\" are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan. The Amorites (Hebrew Emori, so called from Amor, or Emor) oftener than once appear as standing for the Canaanites generally (cf. Genesis 15:16; Deuteronomy 1:20, 21, etc.). That all the inhabitants of Canaan are intended here is evident from the specification of the different districts of the land of Canaan which immediately follows. In the plain: the 'Arabah (see ver. 1). In the hills: the hill country of Judah (Numbers 13:17). In the vale: the shephelah, or lowland, the country lying between the mountain range of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching northwards from the parallel of Gaza to that of Carmel. In the south: the negeb, or southland (literally, dryness), the district which formed the transition from the desert to the cultivated land, extending from the south of the Dead Sea westwards to Gaza, a vast steppe or prairie, for the most part pasture land. The seashore: the narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean from Joppa to Tyre (in the New Testament, \"the coast of Tyre and Sidon,\" Luke 6:17). The land of the Canaanites: the whole country of which these were the separate parts. And unto Lebanon: the Whale Mountain, so called, probably, from the snow which rests on its summit. The great river, the river Euphrates. The Phrath, or Euphrates, which has its sources in the mountains of Armenia, and in its course divides Armenia from Cappadocia, formed the eastern limit of the territory promised by God to Abraham. The epithet \"great\" seems to have been commonly applied to it. Callimachus calls it 'ΑΣΣυριοῦ ποταμοῖο μέγας ρόος ('In Apoll.,' 107), and Lucan has-NEWLINENEWLINE\"Quaque caput rapido tollit cum TigrideNEWLINEmagnus Euphrates.\"NEWLINENEWLINE(Phars.,' 3:256.) As by much the most considerable river of western Asia, the Euphrates was known as \"the river\" par excellence (cf. Exodus 23:31; Isaiah 8:7; Jeremiah 2:18; Psalm 72:8). The mention of Lebanon and the Euphrates is not, as Keil suggests, \"to be attributed to the rhetorical fullness of the style;\" but is due to the fact that these were included in what God promised to Abraham and his seed (Genesis 15:18; Exodus 23:31; Deuteronomy 11:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Behold, I have set the land before you: literally, have given the land before you, i.e. have made it over to you, that you may go and take possession of it. The Lord had placed this land in the power of the Israelites, had given it up to them to possess and use it, according as he had sworn to their fathers, the patriarchs, to give it to them and their seed (comp. Genesis 12:7; Genesis 13:15; Genesis 15:18, etc.; Genesis 22:16). At Horeb, therefore, they received the charter of their inheritance, and might have gone on at once to take possession of the land. The delay that had occurred had arisen solely from their own waywardness and perversity, not from anything on the part of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-18. - Moses reminds them that he had done all that was required on his part to conduct the people to the enjoyment of what God had freely given to them. The people had so increased in number that Moses found himself unable to attend to all the matters that concerned them, or to adjudicate in all the differences that arose among them. God had brought to pass that which he had promised to Abraham (Genesis 15:5), that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; in this Moses rejoiced, nay, he would even that their numbers were, with the Divine blessing, increased a thousandfold beyond what they were. But he found the burden, the weight of care and trouble, especially in connection with their strifes and suits thereby brought on him, too much for him; and, therefore, whilst they were still at Horeb, he had, following the advice of Jethro, his father-in-law, counseled them to select competent men from among themselves, who should relieve him by attending to those duties which he found it too burdensome for him to have to attend to (cf. Exodus 18:13, etc.). This appointment of captains was quite distinct from that of the elders whom God directed Moses to select that they might assist him in bearing the burden of the people (Numbers 11:10, etc.). The occasion of the appointment was the same in both cases, viz. the complaint of Moses that the task was too onerous for him, but the time, the place, and the manner of the two transactions were different. Verse 9. - I spake unto you at that time. The somewhat indefinite phrase, \"at that time\" (comp. Genesis 38:1), does not refer to the time after the people departed from Horeb, but to the time generally when they were in that region (see Exodus 18:5, 13). \"The imperfect (וָאֹמַד, I spake), with yaw tel. expresses the order of thought and not of time\" (Keil). It is not mentioned in Exodus that Moses spake to the people, as here stated, but what Jethro said to him to this effect is recorded; and as Moses proceeded to put in execution what his lather-in-law advised, it is probable that in doing so he told the people what he proposed to do, with his reasons for so doing, and obtained their assent, as here mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Notwithstanding the cruel oppression to which they were subjected in Egypt, the Israelites had so increased in numbers that they went out of the house of their bondage a mighty host. Ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude (cf. Genesis 15:5; Genesis 22:17). God had promised to Abraham that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; and Moses here reminds the people that this promise had been fulfilled. This is hardly to be regarded as the utterance of hyperbole. When God gave the premise to Abraham it was to the stars as seen by the patriarch, not as actually existing in the immensity of space, that reference was made; and as the number of stars which can be taken in with the naked eye does not exceed 3000, and as Israel at this time numbered more than 600,000, counting only the adult males (Numbers 2:32), - it might be literally said of them that they had been multiplied as the stars of heaven. The comparison, however, imported nothing more than that their numbers were very great.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - It was not the vast increase of the people in numbers that distressed Moses, rather was this to him a matter of rejoicing, and his desire was that their increase might become still greater, even a thousandfold. But he felt his own inability, as leader, ruler, and judge, alone to cope with so vast a multitude.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Moses appeals to the good sense of the people themselves: How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? Cumbrance: this is a just rendering of the Hebrew word מֹרֲח, from טָרַח, which, though it occurs only in the Hiphil in Hebrew, in the sense of to cast down (Job 17:11), probably was in use also in the Kal, in the sense of to lay upon, to encumber, which is the meaning of the cognate Arabic followed by . Burden (שָּׁא, from נָשָׂא, to lift up, to carry, to bear), something lifted up and carried, a load or burden. Strife: (רִיב) here, not mere contention, but litigation, suit-at-law. Some understand all these three, of troubles and burdens laid upon Moses, by his being called upon to compose differences, and adjust competing claims among the people. But other burdens besides these came upon him as the leader of the nation; and it seems best, therefore, to understand the first two of troubles and burdens generally.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Take you; literally, give to you or for you, i.e. yourselves. The selection was to be made by the people themselves. Jethro, in giving Moses the advice on which he thus acted, described the men who were to be selected as \"such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness\" (Exodus 18:21). Moses here describes them rather by qualities, indicating ability and fitness for such a post as that to which they were to be called; they were to be wise (which, indeed, may be regarded as comprehending all good moral qualities); understanding men, men of discernment and sagacity, as well as intelligence; and known among their tribes, men of good repute in the community (\"quorum conversatio sit probata,\" Vulgate; comp. Acts 6:3; 1 Timothy 3:7). And I will make them rulers over you; literally, will set them for your heads, i.e. will appoint them to act as superintendents, managers, and judges over you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - The people approved of the proposal, and acted upon it; and Moses accordingly appointed the persons selected to be chiefs over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and ever tens (Exodus 18:21); he appointed men also to be officers, that is, persons who should preserve order in the tribes, keeping the registers, acting as scribes, to prescribe and to take account of work, and perhaps also attending to fiscal arrangements (שֹׁטְרִים, shoterim, a word of general application; cf. Exodus 5:6, 10, 14; Joshua 3:2; 2 Chronicles 26:11, etc. LXX. γραμματεῖς and γραμματο εισαγωγεῖς). In Exodus, Moses is said to have chosen these functionaries (Exodus 18:25); but what many do under the direction of one may be said to be done by him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16, 17. - In installing the judges, Moses solemnly charged them to deal impartially, fairly, and equitably with those who might come before them. Verse 16. - Hear between your brethren, i.e. hear impartially both parties, and judge righteously between man and man, whether both parties are Israelites, or one of the parties a stranger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Ye shall not respect persons; literally, look at or regard aces, i.e. ye shall not deal partially, favoring the one party rather than the other (comp. Exodus 23:2, 3; Leviticus 19:15); the small as well as the great were to be heard, and neither for favor nor from fear were they to pervert justice. The judgment is God's; i.e. appointed by God and administered in his name, the judge acting for God and by his authority, and being answerable to him (comp. 2 Chronicles 19:6). Hence the phrases, \"to inquire of God,\" \"to bring before God\" (Exodus 18:15, 19; Exodus 21:6; Exodus 22:8, etc.) phrases still in use among the Arabs for a summoning to judicial trial. In the case of a matter coming before the judges which they found it beyond their power to decide, they were to bring it before Moses as a superior authority (see Exodus 18:26) \"Some think there were certain causes reserved to the cognizance of Moses; but the contrary appears by these words, that all manner of causes were brought before the judges; and they, not the people, brought such causes before Moses as they found too hard for them to determine. So that they, not the person whose cause it was, judged of the difficulty of the cause. See Selden, lib. 1. \"De Synedriis, cap. 16.\" (Bishop Patrick).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-23. - Here Moses passes from the judges to the people at large; from charging officials to judge righteously, to reminding the people that they also had received from him commandments which they had to obey. The \"things\" referred to are either the injunctions specified in Exodus 21, etc., or simply the instructions mentioned in the preceding verses. God had called the Israelites out of Egypt that they should go up at once to Canaan, and he had by Moses done all that was needed for this. But they had been rebellious, and had opposed God's commands, the consequence of which was that they had been made to experience various trials, especially to wander nearly forty years in the wilderness, so that of those who came out of Egypt only two were privileged to see the Promised Land. The words of Moses in this section supplement and complete the narrative in Numbers 13; but the words are those, not of a compiler, but of one who had been himself a witness of all he narrates. Verses 19-26. - That great and terrible wilderness: the desert forming the western side of the Stony Arabia. It bears now the name of Et-Tih, i.e. The Wandering, a name \"doubtless derived from the wanderings of the Israelites, the tradition of which has been handed down through a period of three thousand years It is a pastoral country; unfitted as a whole for cultivation, because of its scanty soil and scarcity of water\" (Dr. Porter, in Kitto's 'Biblical Cyclopedia,' vol. 3. p. 1075). In the northern part especially the country is rugged and bare, with vast tracts of sand, over which the scorching simoom often sweeps (see on ver. 1). This wilderness they had seen, had known, and had experience of, and their experience had been such that the district through which they had been doomed to wander appeared to them dreadful. Passing by the way of the Amorites, as they had been commanded (ver. 7), they came to Kadesh-barnea (see Numbers 12:16). Their discontent broke out oftener than once, before they reached this place (see Numbers 11, 12.); but Moses, in this recapitulation, passes over these earlier instances of their rebelliousness, and hastens to remind them of the rebellion at Kadesh (Numbers 13, 14.), because it was this which led to the nation being doomed to wander in the wilderness until the generation that came out of Egypt had died. It was through faith in God that Canaan was to be gained and occupied by Israel; but this faith they lacked, and so they came short of what God had summoned them t, attain (Psalm 78:22; Psalm 106:24; Hebrews 3:18, 19; comp. 2 Chronicles 20:20; Isaiah 7:9). Hence, when they had come to the very borders of the Promised Land, and the hills of Canaan were before their eyes, and Moses said to them, in the name of God, Go up, possess (\"asyndeton emphaticum,\" Mi-chaelis), they hung back, and proposed that men should be sent out to survey the land and bring a report concerning it. This was approved of by Moses; but when the spies returned and gave their report, the people were discouraged, and refused to go up. They were thus rebellious against the commandment (literally, the mouth, the express will) of Jehovah their God; and not only so, but with signal ingratitude and impiety they murmured against him, and attributed their deliverance out of Egypt to God's hatred of them, that he might destroy them (see Numbers 13:1-33, to which the narrative here corresponds).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNotwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Ye murmured in your tents; an allusion to what is recorded in Numbers 14:1, etc. Moses addresses the people then with him as if they had been the parties who so rebelled and murmured at Kadesh, though all that generation, except himself, Joshua, and Caleb, had perished. This he does, not merely because of the solidarity of the nation, but also that he might suggest to them the possibility that the same evil spirit might still lurk among them, and consequently the need of being on their guard against allowing it to get scope.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - Our brethren have discouraged our heart; literally, hate melted or made to flow down our heart (הֵמַסּוּ, Hiph. cf מָסַס, to flow down or melt), have made us fainthearted. The cities are great and walled up to heaven; literally, are great and fortified in the heavens. To their excited imagination, the walls and towers of the cities seemed as if they reached the very sky; so when men cease to have faith in God, difficulties appear insurmountable, and the power of the adversary is exaggerated until courage is paralyzed and despair banishes hope. Sons of the Anakims; elsewhere (Numbers 13:22; Joshua 15:14; Judges 1:20) children or sons of the 'Anak. 'Anak may originally have been the proper name of an individual, but it appears m the Bible rather as the designation of the tribe. It is the word for neck, and this race, which were strong and powerful men, or their progenitor, may have been remarkable for thickness of neck; this, at least, is more probable than that it was from length of neck (Gesenius) that they got the name, for a long neck is usually associated with weakness rather than strength. Some have supposed the Anakim to have been originally Cushites; but the origin of the tribe is involved in obscurity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 29-40. - Moses endeavored to rouse the drooping courage of the people, and persuade them to go up by reminding them that God, who was with them, would go before them, and fight for them as he had often done before; but without success, so that God was angry with them, and forbade their entrance into Canaan. This is not mentioned in Numbers, probably because Moses' appeal was unsuccessful. The whole of that generation was bound to fall in the wilderness, except Caleb and Joshua; only their children should enter the Promised Land. Verses 29, 30. - Moses exhorts the people not to be afraid, as if they had to encounter these terrible enemies solely in their own strength; for Jehovah their God was with them and would go before them, as he had gone before them hitherto, to protect them and strike down their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Not only at the Red Sea did God appear for the defense of his people and the discomfiture of their enemies, but also in the wilderness, which they had seen (as in ver. 19), where (אֲשֶׂר, elliptically for אֲשֶׂר בו) Jehovah their God bore them as a man beareth his son, sustaining, tending, supporting, and carrying them over difficulties (comp. Numbers 11:12, where a similar figure occurs; see also Isaiah 46:3, 4; Isaiah 63:9, etc.; Psalm 23.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God; literally, With this thing [or With this word] ye were not believing in Jehovah your God. The Hebrew דָבָר, like the Greek ρῆμα, signifies either thing or word. If the former rendering be adopted here, the meaning will be, Notwithstanding this fact of which you have had experience, viz. how God has interposed for your protection and deliverance, ye were still unbelieving in him. If the latter rendering be adopted, the meaning will be, Notwithstanding what I then said to you, ye remained unbelieving, etc. This latter seems the more probable meaning. In the Hebrew text there is a strong stop (athnach) after this word, as if a pause of astonishment followed this utterance - Notwithstanding this word, strange to say! ye were not believing, etc. The participle (\"believing\") is intended to indicate the continuing of this unbelief. So also in ver. 34, the participle form is used - \"who was going in the way before you,\" to indicate that not once and again, but continually, the Lord went before them; and this made the sin of their unbelief all the more marked and aggravated. (For the fact here referred to, see Exodus 13:21, etc.; Numbers 9:15, etc.; Numbers 10:33-36.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 34. - And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and he was wroth, and sware, etc. (comp.

Joshua also was exempted from this doom; but before mentioning him, Moses refers to himself as having also come under the Divine displeasure.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSave Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The Lord was angry with me also for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. This must be regarded as parenthetical, for what he here refers to in regard to himself occurred, not at the time of the rebellion at Kadesh, but at the time of the second arrival of the people at that place, many years later. This parenthetical reference to himself was probably thrown in by Moses for the purpose of preparing for what he was about to say respecting Joshua, in whom the people were to find a leader after he himself was gone. It may be noted also that Moses distinguishes between the anger of the Lord against him, and the wrath which broke forth upon the people - a distinction which is aptly preserved in the Authorized Version by the words \"was wroth\" (קָצפ) and \"was angry\" (אָנַפ). For your sakes; rather, because of you, on accent of you. The Hebrew word (גָלָל) comes from a root meaning to roll, and signifies primarily a turn in events, a circumstance, an occasion or reason. Moses reminds the Israelites that the misconduct of the people was what led to God's being angry also with him (see Numbers 20:7, etc.; comp. Psalm 106:32, 33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 38. - Though the rebellious generation were to perish, and Moses was not to be permitted to enter Canaan, God would not depart from his promise, but would by another leader bring the people to the inheritance which he had sworn to their fathers to give them. (For the account of Joshua's appointment and installation, see Numbers 27:15-23.) Which standeth before thee; i.e. to be thy minister or servant (Exodus 24:13; Exodus 33:11; Numbers 11:28; comp. for the meaning of the phrase Deuteronomy 10:8; Deuteronomy 18:7; Daniel 1:5). Encourage him; literally, strengthen him (comp. Deuteronomy 3:21, 22; Deuteronomy 31:7, 8). Inherit it; the \"it\" refers back to ver. 35, \"that good land.\" In vers. 8 and 21, the land is spoken of as to be possessed by the Israelites; here it is spoken of as to be inherited by them. The former has reference to their having to wrest the land by force from the Canaanites (יָרַשׁ, to occupy by force, to dispossess; cf. Deuteronomy 2:12, 21, 22, where the verb is, in the Authorized Version, rendered by \"destroy\"); the latter has reference to their receiving the land as a heritage (נָןחל) from God, who, when he divided to the nations their inheritance, assigned Canaan to the children of Israel (Deuteronomy 32:8). \"Joshua the executor of the inheritance\" (Schroeder).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Only among the young of that generation should the inheritance be divided, as they had no part in the rebellion of their seniors. Your little ones; i.e. children beginning to walk (טַפ, from טָפַפ, to trip, to take short and quick steps). And your children - boys and girls - which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil; rather, of whom [ye said] they know not today good and evil. The Hebrews were wont to express totality or universality by specifying contradictory opposites, as, e.g., great and small (2 Chronicles 34:30), master and scholar (Malachi 2:20), free and bond (Revelation 13:16; Revelation 19:18), shut up and left (Deuteronomy 32:36, where see note; 1 Kings 14:10), etc. Accordingly, when good and evil are set over against each other, the notion of entireness or universality is expressed. Thus, when Laban and Bethuel said to Abraham's servant \"We cannot speak unto thee bad or good\" (Genesis 24:50), the meaning is, We can say nothing at all. Absalom spake to Amnon \"neither good nor bad\" (2 Samuel 13:22); that is, he did not say anything to him. The woman of Tekoa said to David, \"As an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad\" (2 Samuel 14:17); i.e. There is nothing the king does not know - his knowledge is universal.

Numbers 14:40-45). Verse 41. - We have sinned; in Numbers it is simply said that \"the people mourned greatly\" (bemoaned themselves, יִתְאַבְּלוּ); but this is not incompatible with the statement here that they confessed their sins; the one would naturally accompany the ether. Their confession, however, was in word only; their conduct showed that it was not sincere. In Numbers (Numbers 14:44) it is said, \"They presumed to go up;\" here it is said (ver. Numbers 14:41), Ye were ready to go up, rather, ye acted heedlessly with levity, or rive. lonely, to go up. The verb here (וַתָּהִינוּ) occurs only in this place, and is of doubtful signification. The Rabbins compare it with the הננו, lo we! here we be! of the people in Numbers 14:40. It is the Hiph. of הוּן, which is supposed to be the same as the Arabic , to be light, easy; and from, this the meaning, \"ye went up heedlessly, is deduced. None of the ancient versions, however, give this meaning. The LXX. has συναθροισθέντες ἀνεβαίνετε εἰς τὸ ὄρος; the Vulgate, instructi armis pergeretis in montem; Onk., ושׁרתון למסק (and ye began to ascend); Syriac, (and ye incited yourselves to go up).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Moses, by the command of God, warned the people that, if they presumed to go up, they should go without his protection, and so would certainly fall before their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - In vain were they thus warned. Moses spoke to them as God commanded, but they would not be persuaded. Went presumptuously; rather, acted insolently and went up; margin, Authorized Version, \"Ye were presumptuous, and went up\" The verb here (חֵזִיד, from זוּד, to boil) signifies tropically, to act proudly, haughtily, insolently (comp.

These tribes came down from the higher mountain range to the lower height which the Israelites had gained, and drove them with great slaughter as far as Hormah, in Seir, chasing them as bees do, which pursue with keen ferocity those who disturb them. Hormah (Ban-place), the earlier name of which was Zephath (Judges 1:17), was a royal city of the Canaanites, taken by the Israelites towards the close of their wanderings, and placed by them under a ban (Numbers 21:1, etc.), which ban was fully executed only in the time of the Judges. It is here and elsewhere called Hormah by anticipation. The old name Zephath seems to have survived that given to it by the Israelites in the name Sebaita or Sepata, the Arabic form of Zephath, the name of a heap of ruins on the western slope of the rocky mountain-plateau Rakhmah, about two hours and a half south-west of Khalasa (Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:431; Palmer, 'Desert of Et-Tih,' p. 289, etc.). This is a more probable identification than that of Robinson ('Res.,' 2:18), who finds Hormah in the rocky defile of Es-Sufah, an unlikely place for a city of the importance of Zephath to be in.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy1:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 45. - Ye returned; i.e. either to Kadesh, where Moses had remained, or from their rebellious and defiant attitude to one of apparent submission and contrition, or the whole phrase, \"Ye returned and wept,\" may mean merely that they wept again, as in Numbers 11:4, where the same words are used. And wept. They mourned their misfortune, and complained on account of it (comp. for the meaning of the phrase, Numbers 11:4, 18, 20). Before Jehovah; i.e. before the tabernacle or sanctuary (comp.

How long they actually remained there cannot be determined, for the expression, many days, is wholly indefinite.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Deut.20":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy20:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - When they found themselves opposed by an army more numerous than their own, and better furnished with the material of warfare, they were not to be afraid or discouraged, for Jehovah their God, who had brought them out of Egypt, would be with them to protect and help them (cf.

It belonged to them to appoint the men who were to serve, and to release those who had been summoned to the war, but whose domestic relations were such as to entitle them to exemption. If there was one who had built a house, but had not dedicated it, i.e. by taking possession of it and dwelling in it; or if there was one who had planted a vineyard and had not eaten of the fruit thereof; or if there was one who had betrothed a wife, but had not yet married her; - such were to be allowed to return home, lest they should die in battle, and it be left to others to consummate what they had begun. According to Josephus, this exemption was for a year, according to the analogy of Deuteronomy 24:5. Dedicated; probably formal possession was taken of the house by some solemn ceremony, followed by a festive entertainment. Vineyard. The Hebrew word (כֶּרֶם) here used designates \"a field or park of the nobler plants and trees cultivated in the manner of a garden or orchard\" (Ges.); so that not vineyards alone, but also olive yards and plots of the more valuable fruit trees may be intended. Hath not eaten of it; literally, hath not laid it open, made it common, i.e. begun to use it, to gather its produce for common use (cf. Deuteronomy 28:30; Jeremiah 31:5).

The phrase, \"captain of a host\" (שַׂר צָבָא), usually designates the general or commander-in-chief of the entire army (Genesis 21:22; 2 Samuel 2:8; 1 Kings 16:16, etc.); but here the phrase is used in the plural of the chiefs of the companies or detachments of which the whole was composed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy20:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-20. - Directions concerning the besieging of towns. In the case of a town at a distance, not belonging to any of the Canaanitish tribes, on advancing against it they were first of all to summon the inhabitants to a peaceable surrender and submission (cf. Judges 21:13). If this was complied with, the inhabitants were to become tributary to the Israelites and serve them; but if this was refused, the town was to be besieged, and, when taken, all the males were to be slain, and the women and children, as well as all the booty that was in the place, were to be taken as the prey of the conquerors, who were to appropriate the spoil to their own use.

The word rendered by \"tribute\" (מַם) denotes properly tribute service, service rendered as a tribute, whether for a season or in perpetuity (cf.

To them no offer of peaceful submission was to be made, and when the city was taken, all the inhabitants without reserve were to be destroyed. This was in accordance with God's command to Israel (Exodus 23:31-33; Exodus 34:11-16; Deuteronomy 7:1-3), and as a precaution against the risk of the people being seduced into idolatry by the heathen should they be allowed to remain in the land. But whilst engaged in besieging a town, they were not to destroy the fruit trees that were outside the walls; but trees that were not for food they might cut down and use in their operations against the city.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy20:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy20:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy20:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - To employ them in the siege; literally, to come, i.e. that they should come into the siege before thee, i.e. either as thine adversary or to be used by thee for the siege. For the tree of the field is man's life. This may mean that the tree supplies food for the sustenance of man's life. But as the words stand in the text, they can only be rendered thus: \"For the man s a tree of the field.\" This gives no good sense, or indeed, any sense at all; and hence it is proposed to alter the reading of the text so as to produce a meaning that shall be acceptable. From an early period the expedient has been resorted to of reading the clause interrogatively, and, instead of regarding it as parenthetical, connecting it with the following words, thus: \"Is the tree of the field a man to come into siege before thee?\" So the LXX., Rashi, etc. It has been thought that only a very slight change in the punctuation is required to justify this rendering (הֶאָדָם instead of הָאָדָם); but more than this is acquired: the subject and object are hereby reversed, and this is more than can be allowed. From an early period also it has been proposed to read the clause as a negation, \"For the tree of the field is not a man to come into siege before thee.\" So the Targum of Onkelos, Abarbanel, Vulgate, etc. The sense here is substantially the same as in the preceding, and the same general objection applies to both. To both also it may be objected that by this way of taking the passage Moses is made to utter a sentiment at once puerile and irrelevant; for what need to declare formally, or in effect, that a tree is not a man? and what reason is there in this for not cutting down fruit trees any more than other trees? In the margin of the Authorized Version an alternative rendering is proposed, \"O man, the tree of the field is to be employed in the siege.\" But admitting this as a possible rendering, it is exposed to the objection, on the one hand, that it is improbable that in a prosaic address like this an explanatory appeal would be introduced; and on the other, that it is inconceivable that Moses would in this casual and startling way anticipate what he goes on in the next sentence to express deliberately and clearly. The passage has probably suffered at the hands of a transcriber, and the text as we have it is corrupt. The sense put upon it in the Authorized Version is that suggested by Ibn Ezra, and in the absence of anything better this may be accepted. The fruit tree is man's life, as it furnishes that by which life is sustained, just as, in Deuteronomy 24:6, the millstone is called a man's life, inasmuch as it supplies the means of life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy20:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - And thou shalt build bulwarks against the city... until it be subdued; literally, That thou mayest build a siege - he, an instrument for besieging, a rampart, or bulwark - against the city, till it come down (cf.

First, the elders and judges (presumably of the neighboring towns; of Josephus, 'Antiq.' 4:8, 16) were to meet, the former as magistrates representing the communities, the latter as administrators of the law, and were to measure the distance from the body of the slain man to each of the surrounding towns, in order to ascertain which was the nearest. This ascertained, upon that town was to be laid the duty of expiating the crime.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - An heifer, which hath not boon wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; a young cow which had not been rendered unfit for consecration, nor had its vital force impaired, by being subjected to forced labor (cf.

Psalm 74:15, Authorized Version, \"mighty rivers;\" Amos 5:24); but here rather the valley or wady through which a stream flowed, as is evident from its being described as neither eared - that is, ploughed (literally, wrought, tilled) - nor sown; a place which had not been profaned by the hand of man, but was in a state of nature. \"This regulation as to the locality in which the act of expiation was to be performed was probably founded on the idea that the water of the brook-valley would suck in the blood and clean it away, and that the blood sucked in by the earth would not be brought to light again by the ploughing and working of the soil\" (Keil). Strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley; rather, break the heifer's neck. As this was not an act of sacrifice, for which the shedding of blood would have been required, but simply a symbolical representation of the infliction of death on the undiscovered murderer, the animal was to be killed by breaking its neck (cf. Exodus 13:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near. The presence of the priests at this ceremony was due to their position as the servants of Jehovah the King of Israel, on whom it devolved to see that all was done in any matter as his Law prescribed. The priests present were probably those from the nearest Levitical town. And by their word shall every controversy and every stroke he tried; literally, And upon their mouth shall be every strife and every stroke, i.e. by their judgment the character of the act shall be determined, and as they decide so shall the matter stand (cf.

This refers to captives from other nations than those of Canaan, with whom the Israelites were to form no alliance, and whom they were not to take captive, but either wholly destroy or render tributary (cf.

The shaving of the head and the paring of the nails, as well as the putting off of the garments worn when taken captive, were signs of purification, of separation from former heathenism, preparatory to reception among the covenant people of Jehovah (cf. Leviticus 14:8; Numbers 8:7). Pare her nails; literally, make or prepare her nails, i.e. by cutting them down to a proper size and form (cf. 2 Samuel 19:25, where the same word is used of dressing the feet and trimming the beard). The Targum of Onkelos takes this in quite an opposite sense, rendering, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, \"suffer to grow,\" and the rabbins who adopt this meaning suppose that the design of the prescription was that the woman, being rendered unlovely, the man might be deterred from taking her to be his wife. But this is altogether alien from the spirit and scope of the passage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The raiment of her captivity; i.e. the raiment she had on whoa taken captive; this she was to lay aside, that she might put on garments of mourning.

Thou shalt not make merchandise of her. The verb in the form here used occurs only here and in Deuteronomy 24:7; derived from a root which signifies to gather or press, it properly means to press for one's self, to lay hands on one, to use violence to one.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - If a man have two wives, one of whom is a favorite and the other disliked, and if his firstborn son be the child of the latter, he is not to allow his love for the other to prejudice the right of the son, but must allow him, both in his own lifetime and in the disposition of his property after death, the full privilege and right of a firstborn son.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - He may not make; literally, is not able to make; i.e. is legally incapable of making.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - A double portion; literally, a mouth of two; i.e. a portion (so \"mouth\" is used in 2 Kings 2:9; Zechariah 13:8) equal to that of two; consequently, the firstborn inherited twice as much as any of the other sons. Amongst all nations and from the earliest times, the right of the eldest son to pre-eminence among his brethren has been recognized; and in legislating for Israel, Moses so far simply sanctioned a usage he found already existing; the assignment, however, of a double share in the inheritance to the eldest son is a new and special provision, mentioned only here. Beginning of his strength (cf. Genesis 49:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-21. - If a son was refractory and unmanageable by his parents, if, given to sensual indulgence, he would yield neither to reproof nor to chastisement, - the parents were to lay hold on him, and lead him to the elders of the town, sitting as magistrates at its gates, and there accuse him of his evil ways and rebelliousness. The testimony of the parents was apparently held sufficient to substantiate the charge, and this being received by the elders, the culprit was to be put to death by stoning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - He will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. Gluttony and drunkenness were regarded by the Hebrews as highly criminal. The word rendered by \"glutton,\" however (זולַל, from זָלַל, to shake, to shake out, to squander), includes other kinds of excess besides eating. It designates one who is prodigal, who wastes his means or wastes his person by indulgence. In Proverbs 23:30, the whole phrase (זולְלֵי בָּשָׂר) is given - squanderers of flesh, i.e. wasters of their own body, debauchees. In Proverbs 28:7, the word is translated \"riotous men\" in the Authorized Version. Disobedience to parents was deemed an offense, which struck at the roots of the whole social institute.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The penalty of such crimes was death; but the power of inflicting this was not among the Hebrews - as among some other ancient peoples, the Greeks and Romans, for instance - left with the father; the punishment could be inflicted only by the community, with the sanction of the magistrate. A Hebrew parent might chastise his child with severity, but not so as to affect his life (Proverbs 19:18, \"Chasten thy son while there is hope, but raise not thy soul [let not thy passion rise so high as] to slay him\"). While parental authority was sacredly preserved, a check was by the Law imposed on hasty passion.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22, 23. - When a criminal was put to death and was hanged upon a tree, his body was not to remain there over-night, but was to be buried the same day on which he was executed. Verse 22. - If a man have committed a sin worthy of death; literally, If there be on a man a judgment of death; if he lie under sentence of death. Hang him on a tree. This refers not to putting to death by strangling, but to the impaling of the body after death (cf. C. B. Michaelis, 'De Judiciis Poenisque Capitalibus in Sac. Script. Commemoratis,' in 'Sylloge Commentt. Theolog.,' edita a D. J. Pott, vol. 4. p. 209). This was an aggravation of the punishment, as the body so impaled was exposed to insult and assault (cf. Numbers 25:4; Genesis 40:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy21:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHis body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - He that is hanged is accursed of God; literally, a curse of God. Some take this as meaning an insult to God, a contemning of him, \"since man his image is thus given up to scorn and insult\" (Rashi). But the more probable meaning is \"a curse inflicted by God,\" which the transgressor is made to endure (cf. Galatians 3:13). That thy land be not defiled. The land was defiled, not only by sins committed by its inhabitants, but also by the public exposure of criminals who had been put to death for their sins (cf. Leviticus 18:24, 25; Numbers 35:33, 34). On this law Joshua acted (cf. Joshua 8:29; Joshua 10:26, 27).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Deut.22":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Go astray; wandering at large. The Hebrew verb means primarily to seduce, draw aside, or entice (cf. Deuteronomy 13:6); and in the passive conveys the idea of wandering through being drawn away by some enticement. Hide thyself from them; i.e. withdraw thyself from them, avoid noticing them or having to do with them. In any case; certainly, without fail.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - An animal that had fallen was also to be lifted up, and the owner was to be assisted to do this. In Exodus, it is specially declared that both these services are to be rendered, even though the parties are at enmity with each other, and the one is the object of hatred to the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The divinely instituted distinction between the sexes was to be sacredly observed, and, in order to this, the dress and ether things appropriate to the one were not to be used by the other. That which pertaineth unto a man; literally, the apparatus (כְּלִי) of a man, including, not dress merely, but implements, tools, weapons, and utensils. This is an ethical regulation in the interests of morality. There is no reference, as some have supposed, to the wearing of masks for the purpose of disguise, or to the practice of the priests at heathen festivals of wearing masks of their gods. Whatever tends to obliterate the distinction between the sexes tends to licentiousness; and that the one sex should assume the dress of the other has always been regarded as unnatural and indecent (comp. Seneca, 'Epist.,' 122, \"Nonne videntur contra naturam vivere qui commutant cum feminis vestem;\" and Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 6:252 -NEWLINENEWLINE\"Quem praestare potest muller galeata pudoremNEWLINEQuae fugit a sexu?\") Such a change of vesture is here declared to be an abomination to the Lord, because of its tendency to immorality.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - (Cf. Leviticus 22:28; Exodus 23:19.) These precepts are designed to foster humane feeling towards the lower animals, and not less to preserve regard to that affectionate relation between parents and their young which God has established as a law in the animal world.

The houses in Palestine, as in other parts of the East, had flat roofs, and, as these were much frequented by the inhabitants for various purposes (cf. Joshua 2:6; 2 Samuel 11:2; 2 Samuel 18:24; Nehemiah 8:16; Matthew 10:27; Acts 10:9), it was necessary that a battlement or balustrade should surround the roof, in order to prevent persons falling over. Hence the direction here given.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-11. - (Cf. Leviticus 19:19.) God has made distinctions in nature, and these are not to be confounded by the mixing of things distinct. The ox and the ass were chiefly used in husbandry; but, as they were of different size and strength, it was not only fitting that they should not be yoked to the same plough, but it might be cruel so to yoke them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - A garment of diverse sorts; sha'atnez, a kind of cloth in which threads of linen and threads of woollen were interwoven. The meaning of the word is uncertain. The LXX. render by κίβδηλος, \"spurious, bad;\" Aquila, by ἀντιδιακείμενον, \"variously disposed, diverse.\" No Semitic etymology can be found for the word, and as the Hebrews derived the textile art from Egypt, the home of that art, the word is probably of Egyptian origin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - (Cf. Numbers 15:38.) Fringes; properly, tassels. The tunic of the Hebrews appears to have been divided at the bottom in front, and back, so that four corners or wings (כַּנְפות) were made, to each of which a tassel was appended (Greek, κράσπεδον, Matthew 9:20; Matthew 23:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy22:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-29. - The laws in this section have the design of fostering purity and fidelity in the relation of the sexes, and also of protecting the female against the malice of sated lust and the violence of brutal lust.

That of a virgin betrothed who has been forcibly violated in the field, where, if she cried for help, her cry was in vain; in this case only the man should be liable to be put to death, whilst the woman was to be held innocent (vers. 25-27).NEWLINENEWLINE4.

The exclusion of persons who had suffered this from the congregation, i.e. from the covenant fellowship of Israel, the πολιτεία τοῦ Ισραὴλ (Ephesians 2:12), was due to the priestly character of the nation. Israel was a kingdom of priests (Exodus 19:6), and the admission into it of one in whom the nature of man, as made by God, had been degraded and marred, would have been unfitting; just as all bodily blemish unfitted a man for being a priest, though otherwise qualified (Leviticus 21:16-24). This law, however, was one of the ordinances intended for the period of nonage; it had reference to the outward typical aspect of the Israelitish constitution; and it ceased to have any significance when the spiritual kingdom of God came to be established. Even under the theocracy, eunuchs were not excluded from religious privileges; they could keep God's Sabbaths, and take hold of his covenant, and choose the things pleasing to him, and so be part of the spiritual Israel, though shut out from the fellowship of that which was outward and national (cf.

Individuals, however, of these nations might be naturalized in Israel, and as proselytes enter the congregation, as the case of Ruth proves.

Vers. 9-11 - When the people went forth to war, all impurity and defilement was to be kept out of their camp. When the host goeth forth; literally, when thou goest forth as a camp or host.

The reference is to a foreign slave who had fled from the harsh treatment of his master to seek refuge in Israel, as is evident from the expression, בְאַחַד שְׁעָרֵיך, \"in one of thy gates,\" i.e. in any part of thy land.

At thine own pleasure; literally, according to thy soul, i.e. desire or appetite (cf. Deuteronomy 14:26). Pluck the ears with thine hand (cf. Matthew 12:1; Luke 6:1). Among the Arabs of the present day the right of a hungry person to pluck ears of corn in a field and eat the grains is still recognized (Robinson, 'Bib.

On this the school of Hillel among the rabbins put the interpretation that a man might divorce his wife for any unbecomingness (Mishna, 'Gittin,' 9:10), or indeed for any cause, as the Pharisees in our Lord's day taught (Matthew 19:3). The school of Shammai, on the other hand, taught that only for something disgraceful, such as adultery, could a wife be divorced (Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebrews et Talm.,' on Matthew 5:31, Opp., tom. 2:290). Adultery, however, cannot be supposed here because that was punishable with death. A bill of divorcement; literally, a writing of excision; the man and woman having by marriage become one flesh, the divorce of the woman was a cutting of her off from the one whole. Lightfoot has given (lee. et.) different forms of letters of divorce in use among the Jews (see also Maimonides, 'De Divortiis,' Deuteronomy 4. § 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHer former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The woman was held to be defiled by her second marriage, and thus by implication, the marrying of a woman who had been divorced was pronounced immoral, as is by our Lord explicitly asserted (Matthew 5:32). The prohibition of a return of the wife to her first husband, as well as the necessity of a formal bill of divorcement being given to the woman before she could be sent away, could not fail to be checks on the license of divorce, as doubtless they were intended to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A man newly married was to be exempt from going to war, and was not to have any public burdens imposed on him for a year after his marriage. Charged with any business; literally, there shall not pass upon him for any matter; i.e. there shall not be laid on him anything in respect of any business. This is explained by what follows. Free shall he be for his house for one year; i.e. no public burden shall be laid on him, that he may be free to devote himself entirely to his household relations, and be able to cheer and gladden his wife (comp. Deuteronomy 20:7). \"By this law God showed how he approved of holy wedlock (as by the former he showed his hatred of unjust divorces) when, to encourage the newly married against the cumbrances which that estate bringeth with it, and to settle their love each to other, he exempted those men from all wars, cares, and expenses, that they might the more comfortably provide for their own estate\" (Ainsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNo man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh a man's life to pledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-14. - Various prohibitions. Verse 6. - No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge; rather, the hand mill and the upper millstone (literally, the rider) shall not be taken (literally, one shall not take) in pledge. Neither the mill itself nor the upper millstone, the removal of which would render the mill useless, was to be taken. The upper millstone is still called the rider by the Arabs (Hebrew reehebh, Arabic rekkab). For he taketh a man's life to pledge; or for (thereby) life itself is pledged; if a man were deprived of that by which food for the sustaining of life could be prepared, his life itself would be imperiled (cf. Job 22:6; Proverbs 22:27; Amos 2:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Against man-stealing: repetition, with expansion, of the law in Exodus 21:16.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - The law concerning the leprosy is in Leviticus 13, 14. By this law the priests are directed how to proceed with those afflicted with leprosy; and here the people are counseled by Moses to follow the directions of the priests in this case, however painful it might be for them to submit to the restrictions that would be thereby imposed upon them, remembering what the Lord did to Miriam the sister of Moses, how even she was separated from the camp by the express command of God until she was healed (Numbers 12:14). Michaelis, Keil, and others, following the Vulgate (\"Observa diligenter ne incurras plagam leprae sed facies quaecunque docuerint to sacerdotes\"), understand this passage as inculcating obedience to the priests, lest leprosy should be incurred as a punishment for disobedience. But it is improbable that a general counsel to submit to the priests should be introduced among the special counsels here given; and besides, the formula הִשָּׁמֶר בְ means, \"Take heed to yourself in respect of\" (cf. 2 Samuel 20:10; Jeremiah 17:21), rather than \"Beware of,\" or \"Be on your guard against.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-13. - If one had to take a pledge from another, he was not to go into the house of the latter and take what he thought fit; he must stand without, and allow the debtor to bring to him what he saw meet to offer. He might stand outside and summon the debtor to produce his pledge, but he was not insolently to enter the house and lay hands on any part of the owner's property. To stand outside and call is still a common mode of seeking access to a person in his own house or apartment among the Arabs, and is regarded as the only respectful mode. There would be thus a mitigation of the severity of the exaction, the tendency of which would be to preserve good feeling between the parties. If the debtor was needy, and being such could give in pledge only some necessary article, such as his upper garment in which he slept at night, the pledge was to be returned ere nightfall, that the man might sleep in his own raiment, and have a grateful feeling towards his creditor. In many parts of the East, with the Arabs notably, it is customary for the poor to sleep in their outer garment. \"During the day the poor while at work can and do dispense with this outside raiment, but at night it is greatly needed, even in summer. This furnishes a good reason why this sort of pledge should be restored before night\" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:192, 500). The earlier legislation (Exodus 22:25, 26) is evidently assumed here as well known by the people. It shall be righteousness unto thee (see on Deuteronomy 6:25).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14, 15. - The wage of the laborer was to be punctually paid, whether he were an Israelite or a foreigner (cf. Leviticus 19:13; the law there is repeated here, with a special reference to the distress which the withholding of the hire from a poor man even for a day might occasion).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAt his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Among heathen nations it was common for a whole family to be involved in the penalty incurred by the head of the family, and to be put to death along with him (cf. Esther 9:13, 14; Herod., 3:118, 119; Ammian. Marcell., 23. 6; Curtius, 6:11, 20; Claudian, 'In Eutrop.,' 2:478; Cicero, 'Epist. ad Brut.,' 12, 15). Such severity of retribution is here prohibited in the penal code of the Israelites. Though God, in the exercise of his absolute sovereignty, might visit the sins of the parent upon the children (Exodus 20:5), earthly judges were not to assume this power. Only the transgressor himself was to bear the penalty of his sin (cf. 2 Kings 14:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - The law against perverting the right of strangers, widows, and orphans is here repeated from Exodus 22:20, 21; Exodus 23:9, with the addition that the raiment of the widow was not to be taken in pledge. To enforce this, the people are reminded that they themselves as a nation had been in the condition of strangers and bondmen in Egypt (cf. Leviticus 19:33, 34).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-22. - (Cf. Leviticus 19:9, 10; Leviticus 23:23.)

It is still the custom among the Arabs for the poor to be allowed to gather the berries that may be left on the olive trees after they have been beaten and the main produce carried off by the owner. All the injunctions in this section are adapted to preserve relations of brotherliness and love among the people of the Lord.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy24:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.VERSEENDNEWLINE","Deut.25":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-3. - The first and second verses should be read as one sentence, of which the protasis is in ver. 1 and the apodosis in ver. 2, thus: If there be a strife between men, and they come to judgment, and they (i.e. the judges) give judgment on them, and justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked, then it shall be, if the wicked deserve to be beaten (literally, be the son of blows), that the judge, etc. It is assumed that the judges shall pronounce just judgment, and apportion to the guilty party his due punishment; and then it is prescribed how that is to be inflicted. In the presence of the judge the man was to be cast down, and the adjudged number of blows were to be given him, not, however, exceeding forty, lest the man should be rendered contemptible in the eyes of the people, as if he were a mere slave or brute. This punishment was usually inflicted with a stick (Exodus 21:10; 2 Samuel 7:14, etc.), as is still the case among the Arabs and Egyptians; sometimes also with thorns (Judges 8:7, 16); sometimes with whips and scorpions, i.e. scourges of cord or leather armed with sharp points or hard knots (1 Kings 12:11, 14). Though the culprit was laid on the ground, it does not appear that the bastinado was used among the Jews as it is now among the Arabs; the back and shoulders were the parts of the body on which the blows fell (Proverbs 10:13; Proverbs 19:29; Proverbs 26:3; Isaiah 1:6). According to his fault, by a certain number; literally, according to the requirement of his crime in number; i.e. according as his crime deserved. The number was fixed at forty, probably because of the symbolical significance of that number as a measure of completeness. The rabbins fixed the number at thirty-nine, apparently in order that the danger of exceeding the number prescribed by the Law should be diminished (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:24); but another reason is assigned by Maimonides, viz. that, as the instrument of punishment was a scourge with three tails, each stroke counted for three, and thus they could not give forty, but only thirty-nine, unless they exceeded the forty (Maimon., 'In Sanhedrin,' 17:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The leaving the ox unmuzzled when treading out the corn was in order that the animal might be free to eat of the grains which its labor severed from the husks. This prohibition, therefore, was dictated by a regard to the rights and claims of animals employed in labor; but there is involved in it the general principle that all labor is to be duly requited, and hence it seems to have passed into a proverb, and was applied to men as well as the lower animals (cf. 1 Corinthians 9:9; 1 Timothy 5:18). The use of oxen to tread out the corn and the rule of leaving the animals so employed unmuzzled still prevail among the Arabs and other Eastern peoples (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 2:206, 207; 3:6; Kitto, 'Bib. Cycl.,' 1:86).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-10. - Levirate marriages. If a man who was married died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to raise up a successor to the deceased, who should be his heir. The brother who refused this duty must be publicly disgraced. The design of this institution - which was not originated by Moses, but came down from early times (Genesis 38:8), and is to be found amongst ether nations than the Jews, and that even in the present day - was to preserve a family from becoming extinct and to secure the property of a family from passing into the hands of a stranger. The notion that the usage \"had its natural roots in the desire inherent in man who is born for immortality, and connected with the hitherto undeveloped belief in an eternal life, to secure a continued personal existence for himself and immortality for his name through the perpetuation of his family, and in the life of the son who took his place\" (Keil), seems wholly fanciful. Verse 5. - Dwell together; i.e. not necessarily in the same house, but in the same community or place (cf. Genesis 13:6; Genesis 36:7). And have no child; literally, have no son; but this is rightly interpreted as meaning child (so the LXX.; Vulgate; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 23; Matthew 22:25; Madmen., 'In Jibbum.,' 2:6-9); for, if the deceased left a daughter, the perpetuation of the family and the retention of the property might be secured through her (cf. Numbers 27:4, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead; literally, shall rise up on the name of his deceased brother; i.e. shall be enrolled in the family register as heir of the deceased, and shall perpetuate his name.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-10. - If the man refused to marry the widow of his deceased brother, he was free to do so; but the woman had her redress. She was to bring the matter before the eiders of the town, sitting as magistrates at the gate, and they were to summon the man and speak to him, and if he persisted in his refusal, the woman was to take his shoe from off his foot, and spit before his face, and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house. The taking off of the shoe of the man by the woman was an act of indignity to him; it amounted to a declaration that he was not worthy to stand in his brother's place, and was scornfully rejected by the woman herself. As the planting of the shod foot on a piece of property, or the casting of the shoe over a field, was emblematical of taking possession of it with satisfaction (Psalm 60:8; Psalm 108:9); and as the voluntary handing of one's shoe to another betokened the giving up to that other of some property or right; so, contrariwise, the forcible removal from one of his shoe and the casting of it aside indicated contemptuous rejection of the owner, and repudiation of all his rights and claims in the matter. To walk barefooted was regarded by the Jews as ignominious and miserable (cf. Isaiah 20:2, 4; 2 Samuel 15:30). The spitting before the face of the man (בְּפָנַיו in front of him) is by the Jewish interpreters understood of spitting on the ground in his presence (Talmud, 'Jebam.,' 106; Madmen., 'In Jibbum.,' 4:6-8). This seems to be what the words express (cf. Deuteronomy 4:37; Deuteronomy 7:24; Deuteronomy 11:25; Joshua 10:8; Ezekiel 10:8, for the rendering of בפני); and this, according to Oriental notions, would be insult enough (cf. Numbers 12:14; Isaiah 1:6; Niebuhr, ' Description de l'Arabie,' 1:49).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother's house.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11, 12. - But though the childless widow might thus approach and lay hold on the man, no license was thus granted to women to pass beyond the bounds of decency in their approaches to the other sex.

Them they were to overcome by force; wickedness was to be removed by the extinction of the wicked. Moses has already repeatedly reminded the Israelites that they had utterly to destroy the wicked nations of Canaan; and he here closes this discourse by reminding them that there was a nation outside of Canaan which was also doomed, and which they were to root out. This was Amalek, which had attacked the Israelites in their journey at Rephidim, and had taken advantage of their exhausted condition to harass their rear and destroy those who, faint and weary, had lagged behind. For this they had been already punished by the Israelites, who, led on by Joshua, had turned upon them and discomfited them with the edge of the sword. This, however, was not enough; Amalek was to be utterly destroyed, and this the Israelites were to effect as soon as the Lord had given them rest in the Promised Land. It was not, however, till the time of David that this was done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy25:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHow he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - And smote the hindmost of thee; literally, and tailed thee; i.e. cut off thy tail, or rear. The verb (זִנֵּב) occurs only here and in Joshua 10:19.

The fruit presented was the sensible proof that the land was now in their possession, and the confession made along with the presentation was an acknowledgment of their unworthiness, and of the Divine favor as that to which alone they were indebted for the privileged position in which they were placed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy26:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy26:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A Syrian ready to perish was my father. The reference is to Jacob, the stem-father of the twelve tribes, he is here called a Syrian, or Aramaean, because of his long residence in Mesopotamia (Genesis 29-31.), whence Abraham had originally come (Genesis 11:31), and because there the family of which he was the head was founded. The translation \"ready to perish\" fairly represents the Hebrew; the verb אָבַד means not merely to stray or wander, but also to lose one's self, to perish, to be in danger of perishing (cf. Deuteronomy 4:26; Job 29:13; Proverbs 31:6, etc.). Different renderings of this clause have been given. The Targum, Vulgate, Luther, etc., have, \"The Aramaean (i.e. Laban) oppressed my father;\" The LXX., Συρίαν ἀπέλιπεν ὁ πατήρ μου (\"My father left Syria\"); others, \"To the Aramaean my father wandered.\" But these either follow another reading than that of the received text, or they are expedients to soften down the apparent ignominy of the description. The probable allusion to the wandering, nomadic life of the patriarch, however, is not to be lost sight cf. With a few; literally, in men of few; i.e. consisting of few men, as a small company; the father and head of the tribe is named for those belonging to him (cf. Genesis 34:30; Genesis 46:27).

As with the yearly tithe (Deuteronomy 14:23) and the firstlings (Deuteronomy 15:20), so with this portion of the firstfruits, a festive meal was to consummate the service. According to the Law, the firstfruits were the perquisite of the priest (Deuteronomy 18:4; Numbers 18:12, etc.); but of these a portion was to be taken for this special service, and of that a feast was to be made.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy26:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-15. - On the occasion of presenting the tithes, a special service was also to be made. The tithe here referred to is the vegetable or predial tithe, which, at the end of each third year, as here prescribed, was to be converted into a gift to the poor and needy. This, properly the second tithe (LXX., τὸ δεύτερον ἐπιδέκατον), but usually called the third tithe (Tobit 1:7, 8; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 22), is quite distinct from the Levitical tithe prescribed in Leviticus 27:30-33 and Numbers 18:21-32; and it is a mistake to suppose that the law here was designed to contravene or supersede that in the earlier books (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:1010). As this tithe completed the triennial series of tithes which the Israelites had to offer, it was fitting that in presenting it a solemn declaration should be made by the offerer to the effect that he had honorably and conscientiously discharged all the obligations in this respect which the Law laid upon him. Verse 12. - The third year, which is the year of tithing. As each week ended with a Sabbath, so a sabbatical year ended each cycle or week of years; and as on it no tithes were levied, \"the year of tithing\" here specified would be the third and the sixth years in each septennial period.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy26:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Say before the Lord; i.e. address him as present and ready to hear. The expression, \"before the Lord,\" does not necessarily imply that it was in the sanctuary that the prayer was to be offered. Isaac proposed to bless his son \"before the Lord,\" i.e. within his own house or tent (Genesis 27:7); and so the Israelite here might in his own home make his prayer to the Omnipresent Jehovah. I have not transgressed thy commandments, etc. This is not a self-righteous boast; it is rather a solemn profession of attention to duties which might have been neglected, and refers, not to the keeping of every commandment, but to the having faithfully done all that the Law required in respect of tithes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy26:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - In my mourning; i.e. while ceremonially unclean (cf. Leviticus 7:20; Leviticus 21:1, etc.). Neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use; rather, Neither have I removed ought of it being unclean; i.e. he had not only not eaten of it, but he had not removed any part of it from his house (ver. 13) while he was ceremonially unclean, in which state it was unlawful to touch what was hallowed (Leviticus 22:23). Nor given ought thereof for the dead; i.e. on account of the dead; he had not sent any part of it to where there was one dead, according to the custom for friends and relations to send to a house of mourning provisions for the mourners (2 Samuel 3:35; Jeremiah 16:7; Hosea 9:4; Tobit 4:17). Or the reference may be here to the expenses incurred by the death of one for whose funeral the individual had to provide. This view is adopted by Dr. Thomson, who, remarking on this passage, says, \"This was the strongest possible protestation that he had dealt faithfully in the matter of tithing and consecrated things and in charities to the poor. He had not allowed himself to divert anything to other uses, not even by the most pressing and unforeseen emergencies. It is here assumed, or rather implied, that times of mourning for the dead were expensive, and also that the stern law of custom obliged the bereaved to defray those expenses, however onerous.... The temptation, therefore, to devote a part of the tithes, hallowed things, and charities to defray these enormous, unforeseen, and providential expenses would be very urgent, and he who stood faithful at such times might safely be trusted on all other occasions\" ('Land and the Book,' 1:149). The LXX. rendering, τῷ τεθνήκοτι, \"to the dead,\" has led some to suppose that the reference here is to the placing of articles of food in the tomb along with the corpse; but though this custom prevailed among the Jews in later times, as well as among other peoples, there is no ground for supposing it to be referred to here. As all connected with a dead body was held to be unclean, as well as the body itself, a house of mourning with its inhabitants was held to he unclean, and into it, therefore, nothing that had been hallowed might be lawfully carried.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy26:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLook down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - (Cf.

Genesis 2:4; Numbers 3:1; 2 Samuel 22:1; Ecclesiastes 12:3; Isaiah 11:10, etc.). Thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with plaster, The stones, the number of which is not specified, were to be large, because much was to be inscribed upon them, and they were to be covered with a coating of lime or gypsum (שִׂיַד), in order to secure a smooth white surface on which the inscription might be clearly depicted. That the words were not, as Michaelis, Rosenmüller, and others suppose, cut in the stone, and afterwards covered with plaster in order to preserve them, is plain from its being enjoined that they were to be written upon (עַל) the stones so prepared; and besides, as this was intended to be a proclamation of the Law, the main purpose of the erection would have been frustrated had the inscription been concealed by such a covering as that supposed. Among the ancient Egyptians the practice of depicting records on walls or monuments covered with a coating of plaster was common (see Hengstenberg, 'Authentic des Pent.,' 1:464, English translation, 1:433); from them, doubtless, it was borrowed by the Hebrews. It has been suggested by Kennicott that the writing was to be in relieve, and that the spaces between the letters were filled up by the mortar or cement. This is possible, but it is not such a process as this that the words of the text suggest. \"A careful examination of Deuteronomy 27:4, 8, and Joshua 8:30-22, will lead to the opinion that the Law was written upon or in the plaster with which these pillars were coated. This could easily be done, and such writing was common in ancient times. I have seen specimens of it certainly more than two thousand years old, and still as distinct as when they were first inscribed on the plaster\" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' it. p. 204).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - All the words of this law; i.e. all the purely legislative parts of the Mosaic institute. By the \"Law\" here cannot be intended merely the blessings and the curses afterwards mentioned (vers. 14-26); nor is there any reason why this term should be restricted to the precepts of this Book of Deuteronomy, as if they only were to be inscribed on the stones: the term must be extended so as to cover all that Moses had at any time delivered to Israel as a law from God. It is not necessary, however, to suppose that all the reasons and exhortations with which the delivery of these, as recorded in the Pentateuch, was accompanied were to be inscribed along with the Law; still less that the historical details amidst which the record of these laws is embedded should be given. It may be questioned even whether each and all of the legislative enactments of the Torah, reckoned by the Jews to be 613, were to be recorded; for it might be deemed enough that the substance and essence of the Law should be thus presented. But even if the whole was to be inscribed, there would be no serious difficulty in the way of carrying this into effect, seeing there is no limitation as to the number of the stones to be set up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The stones were to be set up on Mount Ebal (cf. Deuteronomy 11:29). The Samaritan Codex and Version have Gerizim here, in place of Ebal; but though some critics have accepted this, it is generally regarded as an arbitrary alteration introduced to favor Samaritan pretensions (see the exhaustive and conclusive Dissertation of Gesenius, 'De Pentat. Samarit'). All the ancient versions, as well as all the Hebrew manuscripts, support the received text.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - Besides the monumental stones, an altar of whole stones, on which no tool had passed (cf.

Exodus 24:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The injunction to write the Law on the stones is repeated, with the addition that it was to be done very plainly (LXX., σαφῶς σφόδρα: Vulgate, plane et lucide), which shows that the main purpose of setting up the stones was that the Law might be easily known by the people (cf. Habakkuk 2:2). The stones and the altar were fittingly placed on Ebal, the mount of cursing. For the setting up of the stones on which the Law was inscribed, and the building beside them of the altar, was the symbolical renewal of the covenant of God with Israel, and the establishment in Canaan of that dispensation which was \"the ministration of condemnation and of death\" (2 Corinthians 3:7, 9), and of that Law which, though in itself \"holy, just, and good,\" can only, because of man's perversity and sinfulness, bring on those who are under it a curse (Galatians 3:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - When Israel renewed the covenant with the Lord, by solemnly setting up the Law in Canaan, it became thereby the nation of God, and bound itself at the same time to hearken to the voice of the Lord, and keep his commandments, as it had already done (cf. Deuteronomy 26:17, 18; Micah 4:5). Verse 9. - Take heed; literally, Be silent; LXX., σιώπα, with silent attention listen (cf.

For this purpose six tribes were to station themselves on Mount Gerizim, and six on Mount Ebal, the former to pronounce the blessing, the latter the curse. (On the situation of these two mountains, see at ch. Deuteronomy 11:29.) The six tribes by whom the blessing was to be pronounced were Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin, all descended from the two wives of Jacob - Leah and Rachel. The tribes by whom the curse was to be uttered were those descended from Zilpah, Leah's maid, viz. Gad and Asher; those descended from Bilhah, Rachel's maid, viz. Dan and Naphtali; with Zebulun and Reuben, both descended from Leah. As, in order to obtain a division of the tribes into two equal portions, two of the sons of Leah must be assigned to the second half, Zebulun and Reuben were chosen, probably because the former was the youngest of Leah's sons, and the latter had by his sin forfeited his birthright (Genesis 49:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - These shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; literally, These shall stand upon the curse on Mount Ebal; i.e. it shall belong to them to utter the curse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The Levites - standing probably in some convenient spot midway between the two mountains (cf. Joshua 8:33) - were to pronounce with a loud voice the blessing and the curse, so that all might hear; and the people were to give their assent, and take to themselves, as it were, the blessing or the curse as uttered, by a solemn Amen. By the Levites here are intended, not the sons of Levi generally, but that portion of them which belonged to the priesthood, and bare the ark of the covenant (cf. Joshua 8:33).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy27:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-26. - The curses to be pronounced were twelve in number, probably to correspond with the number of the tribes. The blessings are not here recorded; but when the injunction here given was fulfilled by Joshua, the blessing as well as the curse was pronounced (Joshua 8:34). And probably, as the Jews report, each, the blessing and the curse, was pronounced alternately (Talmud Bab., 'Sotah,' p. 7; Targum Hieros., in loc.; Surcnhus., 'Mishna,' 3:262). It has sometimes been doubted whether any human voice could be audible over so wide a stretch as that between these two mountains; but this need be no longer matter of doubt, for the experiment has been repeatedly tried in recent times with success (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 150; Bonar, p. 371; Stanley, 'Syr. and Pal.,' p. 13). In the clear atmosphere of the East sounds travel far. It is to be borne in mind also that it was not a single voice that had to make itself heard across the valley on this occasion, but a chorus of voices pro-seeding from a body of priests stationed apparently in the midst between the two companies (cf. Joshua 8:33), and chanting in unison the words of each blessing or curse. Verses 15-26. - Each of the first eleven curses is directed against some particular sin already denounced in the Law. The twelfth curse is directed generally against all breaches of the Law, against those who fail or refuse to set up the whole Law and follow it as the rule of life and conduct. This shows that the sins specially denounced are selected by way of specimen, and also, perhaps, because they are such as could for the most part be easily concealed from judicial inspection.

Numbers 27:17; Psalm 121:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed shall be thy basket and thy store.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBlessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The effect of the blessing should be seen, not only in the supremacy of Israel over all opposition, but in the abundance of their possessions, in the success of their undertakings, and in the respect in which they should be held by all nations. Storehouses. The Hebrew word (אֲסָמִים), which occurs only here and in Proverbs 3:10, is properly thus rendered. It comes from a root which signifies to lay up.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Lord would establish them to be a people holy unto himself, in whose Blessed condition all would see that they were indeed his people, favored by him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Thou art called by the name of the Lord; rather, the Name of Jehovah called upon thee. The Name of God is God himself as revealed; and this Name is called or named upon men when they are adopted by him, made wholly his, and transformed into his likeness. This blessing Israel enjoyed as a nation - \"Theirs was the adoption and the glory\" (Romans 9:4) - but it was theirs only in symbol and in shadow (Hebrews 10:1); the reality belongs only to the spiritual Israel, and this came to men in all its fullness when he who is \"the image of the invisible God\" appeared and set up his tent among men, full of grace and truth (John 1:12, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - The Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods; literally, shall make thee to abound for good; i.e. shall not only give thee abundance, but cause it to redound to thy felicity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - His good treasure; equivalent to his treasure-house, i.e. heaven, whence blessing should be poured out upon them (cf. Deuteronomy 11:14; Leviticus 26:4, 5). He would so fructify their ground, and so bless their toil in cultivating it, that they should become rich, and be able to lend to other nations, and not need to borrow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - They should be manifestly superior to other nations, heading them and being above them, their leader and not their subject or follower (cf. Isaiah 9:13). Note the contrast in vers. 43, 44.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - (Cf. Deuteronomy 5:29; Deuteronomy 11:28.) Moses ends as he began, by reminding them that the condition of enjoying the blessing was obedience to the Divine Law, and steadfast adherence to the course in which they were called to walk.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-68. - The curse. In case of disobedience and apostasy, not only would the blessing be withheld, but a curse would descend, blighting, destructive, and ruinous. As the blessing was set forth in six announcements (vers. 3-6), the curse is proclaimed in form and number corresponding (vers. 16-19). The curse thus appears as the exact counterpart of the blessing. The different forms in which the threatened curse should break forth are then detailed in five groups.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed shall be thy basket and thy store.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-26. - First group. The curse should come upon them in various forms of evil, filling them with terror and dismay, and threatening them with utter ruin (cf. Malachi 2:2). Verse 20. - Vexation; rather, consternation; the deadly confusion with which God confounds his enemies. The same word is used in Deuteronomy 7:23; 1 Samuel 14:20. Rebuke; rather, threatening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 21, 22. - The afflictive visitations here named are such as destroy life; but the distinctive character of each it is not easy exactly to define. The pestilence is probably a generic term for any fatal epidemic. In the LXX. it is usually represented by the general word Odoacer, death. Consumption; literally, wasting; the designation of any species of tabes or marasmus. Fever (דַּלֶּקֶת, from דָּלַק, to be parched, to glow); inflammation (חַחְתֻר, from חָרַר, to burn); burning fever (קַדַּחַת, from קָדַח, to kindle): different species of pyrexia, the distinction between which has not been determined. The sword. Instead of חֶרֶב, sword, the Vulgate, Arabic, and Samaritan adopt the reading חֹרֶב, heat, drought (Genesis 31:40); but all the other versions support the reading of the received text, and there is no reason why it should be departed from, more especially as drought is threatened in the verse that follows. Blasting and with mildew; diseases that attack the grain (Amos 4:9); the former (שִׁדָּפון, from שָׁדַּפ, to scorch, to blast) a withering or scorching of the ears caused by the east wind (Genesis 41:23); the latter (יֵרָקון, from יָרַק, to be yellowish) the effect produced by a hot wind, which turns the ears yellow, so that they are rendered unproductive.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23, 24. - Terrible drought is here threatened; no rain should fall (cf. Leviticus 26:19); but instead thereof dust, both light as powder and heavy as sand, should fall upon them. The allusion is probably to those clouds of dust and sand which often fill the air in Palestine, when the heat is intense and there has been no rain for a season; the wind then becomes a vehement sirocco, and the air is filled with sand and dust, and is like the glowing heat at the mouth of a furnace (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 2:123; Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 2:311).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25, 26. - Utter defeat in battle (the opposite of the blessing promised, ver. 7) and dispersion among the nations are threatened, with the utmost indignity to those who were slain, in their bodies being left unburied to be devoured by birds of prey and wild beasts (cf. 1 Kings 14:11; Psalm 79:2; Jeremiah 7:33; Jeremiah 16:4, etc.). Shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth; literally, shalt be a tossing to and fro to all the kingdoms, etc.; \"a ball for all the kingdoms to play with\" (Schultz; cf. 2 Chronicles 29:8; Jeremiah 15:4; Jeremiah 24:9; Jeremiah 29:18, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 27-34. - Second group. The Lord should afflict them with various loathsome diseases, vex them with humiliating and mortifying calamities, and give them over to be plundered and oppressed by their enemies. Verse 27. - Botch of Egypt; the form of leprosy peculiar to Egypt (Exodus 9:9, etc.), elephantiasis, \"AEgypti peculiare malum\" (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 26:1-5). Emerods; tumors, probably piles (cf. 1 Samuel 5.). Scab; probably some kind of malignant scurvy. Itch; of this there are various kinds common in Egypt and Syria.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 28, 29. - Besides bodily ailments, mental diseases should come upon them - insanity, incapacity, confusion of mind, so that even at midday they should grope as a blind man gropes, i.e. under the most favorable circumstances they should be unable to find the right path, to hit on the right and safe course. It is of mental blindness that the word is here used (cf. Isaiah 42:19; Lamentations 4:14; Zephaniah 1:17; Romans 11:25; 2 Corinthians 4:4). Thou shalt grope (cf. Isaiah 59:10). Thus afflicted in body and mind, their state should be one only of oppression and calamity, with no hope of deliverance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30-34. - The spoliation of them should be utter. All most dear and precious to them should be the prey of their enemies. Wife, house, vineyard, herd, and flock should be ruthlessly taken from them; sons and daughters should be carried into captivity, and their eyes should look for them in rain, with constant and wasting longing (cf. Jeremiah 8:20; Amos 5:11; Micah 6:15; Zephaniah 1:13; 2 Chronicles 29:9; Nehemiah 11:36; Jeremiah 5:15). Verse 30. - And shalt not gather the grapes thereof; margin, \"Hebrew, profane.\" This is the literal rendering of the verb; the meaning is that given in the text. A vineyard was, for the first three years after it was planted, held sacred (Leviticus 19:23); after that, its consecration ceased, and the fruit might be gathered for common use (cf. Deuteronomy 20:6), and it was said to be profaned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thine hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - And there shall be no might in thine hand. Keil proposes to render here, \"Thy hand shall not be to thee towards God;\" and others, \"Thy hand shall not be to thee for God,\" i.e. instead of God. But אֵל here is not \"the Mighty One, God; but simply\" might, strength, power,\" as in Genesis 31:29; Proverbs 3:27; Micah 2:1. Literally rendered, the words are, And not for might is thy hand, the meaning of which is well expressed in the Authorized Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 35-46. - Third group. Moses reverts to the calamities already threatened (ver. 27), for the purpose of leading on the thought that, as such diseases separated the sufferer from the society of his fellows, so Israel should be separated from God and brought under the dominion of strangers as a punishment for rebellion and apostasy. Verse 35. - A sore botch; an incurable leprosy, affecting not merely the joints and extremities, but the whole body. Such an affliction would exclude a man from all fellowship and from all covenant privileges of the nation. So Israel, rendered unclean by their sin, should be cut off from covenant union with God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 36, 37. - As a consequence, God would bring them under subjection to a foreign power, and they should be made to serve other gods, wood and stone (Deuteronomy 4:28), and would become an object of horror, a proverb, and a byword among the nations (cf. 1 Kings 9:7; Jeremiah 24:9). Yen. 38. - Even in their own land the curse would overtake them and rest upon them in all their interests and relations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:38VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:39VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 39. - Worms; probably the vine weevil, the convolvulus or involvulus of the Latin writers (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 17:47; Care, ' De Re Rust.,' c. 95; Plaut., 'Cistell.,' 4:2), the ἴξ er ἴψ of the Greeks (Bochart, 'Hieroz.,' pt. it. bk. 4. e. 27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 40. - Thine olive shall cast his fruit. Some would render here \"shall be plundered or rooted out,\" taking the verb יִשַּׁל as the Niph. of שָׁלַל; but the majority regard it as part of the verb נָשַׁל, and render \"shall drop off,\" or as in the Authorized Version. There is some doubt, however, whether the verb נָשַׁל can be used intransitively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - Consume; literally, take possession of. The name given here to the ravaging insect is not the same as in ver. 38; but there can be no doubt it is the locust that is intended.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 43, 44. - (Cf. vers. 12, 13.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - These curses would be for a sign and for a wonder, exciting astonishment and dismay in the beholder, and showing that it was indeed the hand of God that was upon the rebellious nation. Forever. This, though it may imply the final and utter rejection of Israel as a nation, does not preclude the hope of restoration of a part of Israel as individuals, or as a remnant remaining in or returning to faith and obedience (cf. Isaiah 10:22; Isaiah 6:13; Romans 9:27; Romans 11:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:47VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 47-57. - Fourth group. In order still more to impress on the minds of the people the evil and danger of rebellion and apostasy, Moses enlarges on the calamities that would ensue on their being given up to the power of the heathen. Because they would not serve Jehovah their God, they should be delivered to be servants to their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:48VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:49VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 49, 50. - The description here given of the enemy to whom Israel was to be subjected, applies more or less closely to all the nations whom God raised up from time to time, to invade Israel and chastise the people for their rebellion - the Chaldeans (cf. Jeremiah 48:40; Jeremiah 49:22; Ezekiel 17:5-7; Habakkuk 1:6, etc.), the Assyrians (cf. Isaiah 5:26; Isaiah 38:11; 23:19), the Medes (Isaiah 13:17, 18); but there are features in the description which apply especially to the Romans; and the horrors delineated in the latter part of the section (vers. 52-57) carry one's thoughts immediately to the terrible scenes which transpired during the wars of Vespasian and Titus with the Jews as narrated by Josephus ('De Bell. Jud.,' 6; see Milman, ' Hist. of the Jews,' bk. 16.). Verse 49. - As the eagle flieth. The eagle was the common ensign of the legion in the Roman army; and by the Latin writers aquila (eagle) is sometimes used for a legion (Caes., 'Hisp.,' 30; cf. Matthew 24:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:50VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 50. - A nation of fierce countenance; literally, firm or hard of face; i.e. obdurate and determined (cf. Proverbs 21:29; Daniel 8:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:51VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:52VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 52-57. - (Cf. Leviticus 26:29; 2 Kings 6:24-30; Jeremiah 19:9; Lain. 2:20; 4:10.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:53VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:54VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:55VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:56VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 56. - So intense should be the hunger, that the delicate and sensitive woman, brought up in luxury, and who would not set her foot on the ground lest she should be fatigued by the exertion or offended by coming in contact with the base soil, but when she went abroad must be carried in a litter or borne by a camel or an ass, - even she should break through all restraints of delicacy and affection, and would secretly devour the very infant she had borne during the siege.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:57VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 57. - Her young one; literally, her after-birth. The Hebrew suggests an extreme of horror beyond what the Authorized Version indicates.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:58VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 58-68. - Fifth group. Even these fearful calamities would not be the consummation of their punishment. If they should be obstinate in their rebellion; if they would not observe to do all that the Law delivered by Moses enjoined on them if they ceased to reverence and obey Jehovah, their God; - then should come upon them the curse in full measure, and long-continued chastisement should show how grievous had been their sin. Verse 58. - This book. Not the Book of Deuteronomy, which was not then written, but the Book of the Law, the Torah, delivered by Moses to Israel from God; and of which he had been, in his addresses to the people, recapitulating some of the principal points (cf. vers. 60, 6l). That thou mayest fear, etc. It was not mere outward observance of the Law, not the mere \"doing\" of what was enjoined that was required, but the doing of it heartily and sincerely in the fear of the Lord, in the fear of him who had revealed himself to them by the glorious and awful Name, Jehovah, their God (cf. Leviticus 24:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:59VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:60VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 60, 61. - The diseases of Egypt are the plagues sent on Pharaoh and his people, as recorded in Exodus 7. - 11. Besides these, other plagues, not recorded in the Book of the Law, should come on rebellious Israel, so that they should be almost utterly destroyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:61VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAlso every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy28:62VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 62. - (Cf.

There ye shall be sold; literally, shall sell yourselves; i.e. give yourselves up to be sold as slaves. Egypt may be here, as Hengstenberg suggests, \"the type of future oppressors;\" but there seems no reason why the passage should not be taken literally. It is a fact that, after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus, the Jews were in large numbers carried into Egypt, and there subjected to most ignominious bondage; and in the time of Hadrian, multitudes of Jews were sold into slavery (Josephus, 'De Bell.

This was not a new covenant in addition to that made at Sinai, but simply a renewal and reaffirmation of that covenant. At Sinai the covenant was, properly speaking, made; sacrifices were then offered, and the people were sprinkled with the sacrificial blood, whereby the covenant was ratified (Exodus 24; cf.

As they would not attend to God's word, as they had shut their eyes and their ears, that they might not see, or hear, or learn what God was teaching them by his conduct towards them, they had been left to themselves; and, as a necessary consequence, they had become as persons who had no eyes to see, or ears to hear, or heart to perceive what was set before them for their learning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy29:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Having referred to the gracious dealing of God with them in the wilderness, Moses introduces Jehovah himself as speaking to them (cf.

That thou shouldest enter into covenant. The expression in the Hebrew is a strong one, indicating not a mere formal engagement, but a going thoroughly into the covenant; the phrase is used of the sword going through the land (Leviticus 26:6), and of one going into the pit (Job 33:28). Into his oath. Covenants were confirmed by oath (Genesis 26:28; Hebrews 6:17); hence in Scripture the covenant of God is sometimes called his oath (ver. 14; 1 Chronicles 16:16; Hebrews 7:28).

Gall. The Hebrew word so rendered (רלֺאשׁ) is supposed by Gesenius to be the poppy plant, by Celsius to be the hemlock (it is so rendered, Hosea 10:4; Amos 6:12, and by AEdman to be colocynth. It is probably a general name for what is poisonous and bitter; for it is used of poison generally (Deuteronomy 32:32) and of the venom of asps (Deuteronomy 32:33; Job 20:16), as well as of poisonous roots and bitter fruits (see Kitto, 'Bibl.

Psalm 81:13 [12]; Jeremiah 3:17; Jeremiah 7:24; Jeremiah 9:13 [14]; 11:8). To add drunkenness to thirst; a proverbial expression, of which very different explanations have been given. It is now generally admitted that the verb (סְפות) cannot be taken here in the sense of \"add,\" but has its proper sense of pouring out, pouring away, destroying. The word rendered \"drunkenness\" (רָוֶת, from רָוָה, to be sated with moisture, to be drenched) means rather \"sated, drenched, well-watered;\" and the word rendered \"thirst\" (צְמֵאָה, from צָמֵא, to thirst) is properly thirsty, and is used of dry land (Isaiah 44:3); both are adjectives, and a substantive is to be supplied. Some supply נֶפֶשׁ, soul or person; others, אֶרֶץ, land. The former render, \"The full [soul] with the thirsty\" (Gesenius); or, \"Them that are sated with them that are thirsty,\" i.e. as well those who have imbibed the poison as those who thirst for it (Knobel); or \"That the sated [soul] may destroy the thirsty,\" i.e. that the impious one, restrained by no law and, as it were, drunk with crime, may corrupt others, also prone to evil, and bring on them destruction (Maurer). Those who supply \"land,\" render \"To destroy the well-watered [land] with the dry.\" This last seems the preferable rendering; but the general meaning is the same in either case, viz. that the effect of such hardness of heart would be to destroy one and all. \"The Orientals are fond of such bipartite forms of expressing the whole (cf.

It is evident from this that Moses contemplates, and in fact here predicts, a defection, not of individuals or families merely, but of the nation as a whole from the Lord, and the punishment which came in consequence upon the nation. The words from \"when they see\" (ver. 22) to \"wrath\" (ver. 23) are a parenthesis, in which a reason for the main thought is given in a circumstantial clause; and the \"say\" of ver. 22 is resumed by the \"say\" of ver. 24.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy29:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, etc.; rather, sulfur and salt, a burning the whole land thereof, it shall not be sown, etc. The words \"sulfur,\" etc., are in apposition to the \"plagues and sicknesses\" of ver. 22, and thus so far depend on the \"see.\" The description here is taken from the country around the Dead Sea, to which there is an express allusion in the close of the verse (cf.

According to Baxtorf, the large lamed represents the first letter of l'olam, forever, and the yod, the numeral 10, represents the ten tribes, whose perpetual omission from the nation of Israel is thus indicated ('Tiberias,' 1. c. 14, p. 157).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy29:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - By secret things, here, some understand \"hidden sins,\" which are known only to God, and which he will punish (Targum Jon.); but the meaning rather is, things in God's purpose known only to himself: these things, it is affirmed, belong to him, are his affair, and may be left with him. On the other hand, the things revealed are the things made known by God to man in his Word, viz. his injunctions, threatenings, and promises; and with these men have to do. This verse is by some regarded as part of the answer given to the question of ver. 24; but others regard it as a general reflection added by Moses by way of admonition to his previous discourse. This latter view is the more probable, and the scribes may have had this in their mind when they distinguished the words, unto us and to our children, by placing over them extraordinary points , in order to emphasize them, though by many this is regarded as a mere critical notation, indicating a various reading (Buxtorf, 'Tiberias,' 1. c. 17, p. 179; Havernick, 'Introd.,' p. 281; Bleek, 'Einleit,' p. 799).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Deut.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-23. - THE NEW BEGINNING AND REVIEW OF THE JOURNEYINGS OF ISRAEL FROM KADESH TO THE RIVER ARNON, THE FRONTIER OF THE AMORITES. At this point the language of address is exchanged for that of narrative. The change of subject from \"ye abode\" to \"we turned,\" became necessary when Moses passed from exhorting and warning the people to narrating what happened after they resumed their journeyings; and gives no support to the notion of some recent German critics, that Moses left Kadesh with only a portion of the people, while the rest remained there, so that no entire departure of Israel from Kadesh ever took place - a notion which the whole tenor of the subsequent narrative contradicts. In obedience to the Divine command (Deuteronomy 1:40), the people, after tarrying for a while at Kadesh, took their departure and marched in the direction of the Yam-suph (Numbers 14:25). Verse 1. - And we compassed mount Seir many days. These \"many days\" are the thirty-eight years during which the people wandered in the wilderness before they camped the second time at Kadesh; their going round Mount Seir, which was in Edom (Genesis 36:8, 9, 20), is descriptive of their nomadic wanderings in various directions, west, south, and south-east of that mountain (Numbers 21:4). \"Crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (Numbers 21:4, 5), the Israelites issued into the great and elevated plains which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims on their way to Mecca; and appear to have followed northward nearly the same route which is now taken by the Syrian Hadgi along the western skirts of this great desert near the mountains of Edom\" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:253, 559). Mount Seir is now Jebal and esh-Sherah. This mountain range is a continuation of that which surrounds the eastern side of the Dead Sea.

As the Israelites, however, kept on the outskirts of their country, and did not attempt to penetrate into the interior, the Edomites did not attack them or seek to hinder their progress. The Israelites, on the other hand, were strictly forbidden to invade that country in a hostile manner; they were to watch over themselves, so as not to be tempted to make war on the Edomites, who were their brethren; as God would not give them any part, not so much as a foot-breadth, of that laud, for he had given Esau (i.e. the race descended from Esau, the Edomites - LXX, τοῖς υἱοῖς Ησαῦ) Mount Seir for a possession.

Accordingly, they were enjoined to buy from them for money food and water as they required. Two different words in the Hebrew are rendered here by \"buy\" in the Authorized Version; the former, שָׁבר, a denominative from שֶׁבֶר, grain, properly means to deal in grain, whether as buyer or seller, and so to buy food; the latter, שָׁרָה, means primarily to dig (a well, e.g., Genesis 26:25), and, as used here, probably conveys the idea that the Israelites were to pay for permission to dig wells in the country of the Edomites to supply themselves with water as they passed along; this, however, does not necessarily follow from the use of this word, for it has also the meaning to buy (comp. Hosea 3:2, and the corresponding Arabic verb, kara, which in certain conjugations has the meaning to borrow or hire).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They were enabled to buy what they required - For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand; their flocks and herds had increased during their wanderings (Numbers 32:1); and they may have gained wealth by cultivating the soil at places where they had made a lengthened sojourn, or by traffic with the tribes of the desert with whom they came in contact. Jehovah their God had known - had noted, observed, had regard to, had cared for (setup. Genesis 39:6; Psalm 1:6; Proverbs 27:23) - their walking - their peregrinations - through this great wilderness; he had been their Leader, had chosen for them places to rest in, had provided food for them, and had been their Protector and Guardian all through the forty years of their pilgrimage, so that they had wanted for nothing (Deuteronomy 1:33; Deuteronomy 8:2, 3, 15, 16; comp. Psalm 23:1-6). \"He sufficiently supplied what was needful for thee when thou walkedst through this great wilderness; for these forty years the Word of Jah thy God hath sustained thee; nor hath anything been wanting to thee\" (Chaldee Paraphrase).

Thus they came to where they were then encamped, in the steppes of Moab. \"Probably they followed the still used caravan route to Damascus, between the east side of the cultivated laud, and the west side of Arabia Deserta\" (Schroeder). Elath or Eloth (אֵילות אֵילַת, palmgrove) - the Αἰλὰθ of Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 9:12; the Αλανα of Ptolemy (5:17) - was a city of Idumea, situated on the eastern gulf of the Red Sea. Its ruins are still traceable near the modern fortress of Akabah, on the northwest (Burckhardt, p. 509; Robinson, 1:241). Ezion-geber (עֶצֶיון גֶבֶר, backbone of a man, so called probably from the rugged and jagged rocks in its vicinity), a seaport near to Elath (cf. 1 Kings 9:26; 2 Chronicles 20:36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The Moabites, being the descendants of Lot, and so allied by race to the Israelites, the latter were commanded to pass through their country without offering them any injury or assault. Ar, a border-town of Moab (Numbers 21:15), here put for the country itself. It is the Areopolis of the Greeks, and was, as Jerome tells us, destroyed in a single night by an earthquake. A hill with ruins a short distance southwest from Ara'ir, is supposed to be its site.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-12. - The mention of the Moabites gives occasion to the author to introduce some notices of the ancient inhabitants of Edom and Moab. In Moab dwelt, in the earlier times, the Emim, a giant race, potent and numerous, like the 'Anakim. They were also, like the 'Anakim reckoned among the Rephaim, but were by the Moabites called Emim. The word Emim means frightful, and was given to these men probably because of their huge stature and fierce aspect. Anakims (see Deuteronomy 1:28). Rephaim seems to have been a generic name of these gigantic Canaanitish tribes (see Genesis 14:5; Genesis 15:20). The Horim appear from the name (from חוד, a cave) to have been a Troglodyte race, inhabiting the caves which abound in the Edomite range, and with whom, perhaps, originated the conception which was at a later period carried out in the marvelous rock city of Petra. Of their own origin nothing is known. As Israel did [or has done] unto the land of his possession. This cannot be regarded as uttered proleptically; it must either be the insertion of a later age, or it must refer to the conquest which had actually been made before this by the Israelites of the land to the east of the Jordan. and which is, in Deuteronomy 3:20, described as the possession which the Lord had given to the two tribes and a half to whom it had been assigned. The latter is the preferable supposition.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhich also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered.

There is no need, therefore, for the insertion \"I said,\" in ver. 13; the words are those of Jehovah, not of Moses. Verse 13. - The brook Zered; either the stream of the Wady cf. Ahsy (Robinson, 2:157; Ritter, 3:78), or that of the Wady Kerab (Keil, Kurz, etc.); see Numbers 21:11, and Smith's 'Dictionary.' 3:1842. This brook formed the boundary line between Edom and Moab, and was the limit of Israel's wanderings in the wilderness. They crossed it thirty-eight years after the doom had been pronounced upon them at Kadesh, and during that period the entire generation of those who had rebelled had died out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Men of war; those of age sufficient to go forth to war, viz. twenty y. ears old and upwards (Numbers 1:3; Numbers 14:29).

To the east of Moab was the country of the Ammonites; these, also, the Israelites were to leave unassailed, for the Lord had given to them their land for a possession (cf. ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat the LORD spake unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Coast of Moab; the boundary of Moab, which was the river Arnon, hod.

As the Israelites were passing eastward of Moab; when they crossed the Arnon, the Ammonites, whose dwelling was in the wilderness east of the Jordan, would be almost in front of them. The Israelites came over against them after they conquered Sihon (cf. Numbers 21:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20-23. - Another parenthetical insertion, containing some ethnographical notices, intended, probably, to confirm the assertion that to the children of Ammon God had given their land for a possession. There is no sufficient reason for supposing that this paragraph is an interpolation, or gloss, inserted by some later writer. It lay as much in the way of Moses to introduce such ethnographical notices as in that of any writer of a later age. Verse 20. - Before the Ammonites, the laud was occupied by a gigantic race, called by them, Zamzummim (probably noisy ones, from זָמַם to hum, mutter; or, as the verb also signifies, to muse or meditate, perhaps moody ones; whether the same as the Zuzim of Genesis 14:5 - LXX., ἔθνη ἰσχυρά, as if from זוּז, to overflow, to abound - is uncertain). The colossal stone monuments, resembling what in Europe are known by the Celtic names of dolmen, menhir, and cromlech, still to be found in the land of Moab, are supposed to be the work of these aboriginal inhabitants of the country, the gigantic Emim and Zamzummim. This giant tribe the Lord had destroyed before the Ammonites, just as he had destroyed the Horim before the children of Esau in Seir.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - So also the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor (Genesis 10:14), probably the island of Crete (Ritter, 3:262), drove out the Avim, a Canaanitish race, who dwelt in villages (Hazerim, חֲצֵרִים) as far as Gaza (Azzah), and took possession of their land; though it would appear some of them still remained among the Philistines (who were Caphtorites, Amos 9:7; Jeremiah 47:4), and were among the tribes not subdued by the Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 13:3). These Caphtorim were, like the Israelites, immigrants, who drove out the original occupants of the country; and on this account, probably, are referred to by Moses here. \"This is so often repeated, to possess the minds of the Israelites with a sense of God's providence, which rules everywhere; displacing one people, and settling another in their stead, and fixing their bounds, also, which they shall not pass without leave\" (Patrick).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24-37. - CONQUEST OF THE KINGDOM OF SIHON. Sihon and his people were Amorites, who had settled on the east of the Jordan in Gilead. But though not included in the original promise to Abraham, God had assigned this territory to the Israelites; and, therefore, he commanded the people under Moses to cross the Amen, and take the first step towards possessing the Promised Land, by assailing Sihon, King of Heshbon, assuring them that from that day he would \"put the dread and fear of them upon all nations under the whole heaven,\" that is, all nations, wherever placed, to whom the fame of the Israelites should come (comp. Exodus 23:27; Deuteronomy 11:16), so that on hearing thereof, they should tremble and writhe as in pain (וְחָלוּ, comp. Isaiah 13:8). Moses, however, in the first instance, sent a message of peace to Sihon, proposing to pass through his territory on the same terms as he had made with the Moabites and Edomites, traveling by the highway, and paying for such provisions as his followers required. But this Sihon refused, and came out against Israel, with all his people, to battle. The issue was that he was utterly discomfited; all his towns were captured, he and all his people utterly destroyed, and the cattle and spoil of the whole country taken for booty. Israel thus became possessed of that entire territory, though it did not lie within the bounds of the land promised by God to Abraham, which was the reason, probably, why Moses made overtures of peace to Sihon, and would have passed through his country amicably, had he been permitted; but comp. Deuteronomy 20:10.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The wilderness of Kedemoth (comp.

The name (from קֶדֶם, the east), signifying eastern parts, indicates that it was situated on the eastern boundary of the Amorite region, so that the desert named from it must have bordered on the great Arabian desert; it may have been on what is now the Derb cf. Haj, or Pilgrims' Road, probably, at Kal'at Balua.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Along by the high way; literally, by the way, by the way, i.e. always, continuously by the way, the public road, called in Numbers 20:17 and Numbers 21:22, \"the king's way,\" probably because made and kept up by the king.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - As the... did unto me. This refers expressly to the fact that the Edomites and Moabites did not hinder the Israelites from passing through their country, though they were far from friendly, and dealt in an unbrotherly way with them, for which the Moabites were afterwards placed under a ban (Deuteronomy 23:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - Heshbon, the chief city of the Amorite king, Sihon. Some ruins on a hill east of the upper end of the Dead Sea, and bearing the name Chesban, mark the site of this once large and important city. Sihon rejected Moses' overtures of peace, because God had hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate; literally, had sharpened his heart, had made his determination keen. It is not to be supposed that any influence was directly exerted on him, to make him obdurate and persistent in his hostility to the people of God; the expression \"he would not\" indicates that it was of his own will that Sihon acted; but it was the will and purpose of God that Sihon should be destroyed, and his country taken by the Israelites, and so he was placed in circumstances by which, \"given over to a reprobate mind,\" he was confirmed and strengthened m his determination to pursue a course which led to his destruction; like Pharaoh, by the circumstances in which God placed him, he found scope for the display and for the confirmation of a stubborn, pertinacious pride of spirit, which led ultimately to his ruin. Nothing so hardens the heart as resistance to God's overtures of peace. As appeareth this day; i.e. as present experience shows; in Sihon's refusing to let them pass, there was already an actual beginning of the fulfillment of God's purpose to deliver him into the hand of the Israelites.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 31-37. - God had determined to give Sihon and his land to the Israelites, and so certainly should this be done, that Moses is exhorted already to begin to seize, in order to possess the land. Sihon initiated hostilities by coming out with all his host to fight against Moses and the Israelites. The battle took place at Jahaz (or Jahazah, or Jahza), a town between Medeba and Dibon (Euseb.; cf. Numbers 33:45), afterwards belonging to the tribe of Reuben (Joshua 13:18), and assigned to the Levites of the line of Merari (Joshua 21:36; 1 Chronicles 6:78). The war was one of extermination, in which all the people of Sihon were destroyed, from one cad of his dominion to the other; all his cities were devoted irredeemably (comp. Leviticus 27:29), and only the cattle and the material property were preserved as booty by the conquerors (Numbers 21:23-26).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32 (cf.

As the Amorites came out of Canaan, they belonged to the race which God had doomed to destruction. The Israelites, therefore, had a commission to extirpate them. Utterly destroyed; literally, devoted or placed under a ban, which of course implied utter destruction. The men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city; literally, every city of men and women and little children. The phrase \"city of men\" can hardly mean, as Rosenmüller affirms, \"men of a city;\" the hypallage here would be too violent. It rather means \"a peopled city,\" \"a city inhabited by men.\" The word rendered \"men\" (מְתִים) does not designate males as opposed to females, but is a designation of human beings in general (cf. Job 11:3; Job 24:12 [Hebrews 20:48]; 31:31; Psalm 26:4, \"vain persons,\" Authorized Version, literally, men of emptiness or of falsehood, etc.). The passage might be rendered, every inhabited city, even the women and the little children.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy2:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFrom Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - Aroer, one of the Amorite cities, on the right bank of the river Arnon (cf. Joshua 12:2; Joshua 13:16). On the Moabite Stone, King Mesha says, \"I built Aroer;\" but this can only mean that, after some temporary condition of decay or ruin, he rebuilt it. On the borders of the northern side of the Wady Mojeb, there are heaps of ruins bearing the name of Ara'ir, which probably mark the site of this ancient town. There was another Aroer, belonging at a later period to the tribe of Gad, and opposite to Rabba, the chief city of the Ammonites (Joshua 13:25; 2 Samuel 24:5); and still another in the south of Judah (1 Samuel 30:28), probably in what is now known as the Wady A'rarah. The city that is by the river; properly, in the river or wady; i.e. At, the capital of Moab, which was in the valley of the Arnon, and which is mentioned here as marking the exclusive limit of the country that was captured. The word rendered \"river\" (נַחַל) is used of the valley or ravine (Arabic, wady) through which a stream flows, as well as of the stream itself (cf. Genesis 26:19; Numbers 24:6, etc.). Ar is elsewhere called Ar of Moab (Isaiah 15:1). Even unto Gilead, i.e. Mount Gilead, which rises to the north of the Jabbok (hod.

Cities in the mountains; the towns in the Ammonitish highlands. In Joshua 13:25, half of the laud of the Ammonites is said to be assigned to the tribe of Gad; but that refers to the part of the land between the Arnon and the Jabbek, which had been taken from the Ammonites by the Amorites, and was in the possession of the latter at the time of the Israelitish invasion (Judges 11:13, etc.).

When dispersed among the nations, if the people should return to Jehovah their God, he would again receive them into favor and gather them from their dispersion (cf. Deuteronomy 4:29, etc.; Leviticus 26:40, etc.). Moses, looking into the future, anticipates that both the blessing and the curse would come upon the people according as they were faithful to their covenant engagement and obedient to God's Law, or were disobedient and unfaithful. But even when the curse came upon them to the full, this would not amount to final rejection; but God would, by the discipline of suffering, lead them to repentance, and then he would again bestow the blessing (cf. Nehemiah 1:9). Verse 1. - Thou shalt call them to mind (cf. 1 Kings 8:47, where the same expression is rendered by \"bethink themselves\"). This is the meaning here also; it is not the mere recollection of the curse and the blessing that is referred to, but a general consideration of their own condition and conduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And shalt return unto the Lord thy God; retrain from the worship of false gods to worship and serve Jehovah the one true God, the God of their fathers, and the God whom as a nation they had before wet-shipped (cf.

The rendering of the LXX. here is noticeable, καὶ ἰάσεται Κύριος τὰς ἁμαρτίας: \"and the Lord will heal thy sins,\" i.e. will remit thy guilt and will deliver thee from the pernicious and destructive power of sin (cf.

This last statement suggests doubt as to the literal interpretation of this prediction, for, as Keil remarks, \"If there is to be an increase in the num-bet of the Jews when gathered out of their dispersion into all the world, above the number of their fathers, and therefore above the number of the Israelites in the time of Solomon and the first monarchs of the two kingdoms, Palestine will never furnish room enough for a nation multiplied like this.\" The reference in the following verse to a spiritual renewal suggests the inquiry whether the reference here is not to such a gathering and restoration of Israel as that which St. Paul describes in Romans 11, when the branches that had been broken from the olive tree shall be again grafted into it, and all Israel shall be saved after the fullness of the Gentiles shall be, brought in. To Moses, and indeed to all the Old Testament prophets and saints, the Israel of God presented itself as a nation dwelling in a land given to it by God; but as the national Israel was the type of the spiritual Israel, and as Canaan was the type of the spiritual kingdom of God, the full import of what is said concerning the former is only to be perceived when it is viewed as realized in the latter. Certain it is that it was on this principle that the apostles interpreted the fulfillment of the Old Testament declarations concerning Israel, of which the explanation given by St. James of Amos 9:11, 12 may be noted as an instructive example (Acts 15:15-17). If the rebuilding of the ruined tabernacle of David is to be effected by \"the residue of men\" being brought to \"seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom his Name is called,\" we need not shrink from interpreting this prophecy of Moses as referring to the restoration of Israel by the bringing in of Jew and Gentile into the one fold under the one Shepherd, the Shepherd of Israel (John 9:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The Lord will circumcise thine heart; \"when thou wilt become better, God will help thereto (cf.

When Israel should return to the Lord, he would take away from them the evil heart of unbelief, and give them the new heart and the right spirit. \"Qui pravis affectibus renunciat is circumcisus corde dicitur\" (Rosenmüller.

Genesis 42:38; Exodus 4:23, where a similar construction occurs).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Israel would then be restored to the full enjoyment of privilege, would again enter into covenant union with the Almighty, and would be enriched with all the blessings of his favor (cf. Deuteronomy 28:11, 63); only, however, on the indispensable condition of their hearkening to the voice of God and being obedient to his Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-14. - The fulfillment of this condition was not impossible or even difficult; for God had done everything to render it easy for them. The commandment of God was not hidden from them; literally, was not wonderful to them; i.e. hard to be understood or to perform (see the use of the Hebrew word in Psalm 131:1; Proverbs 30:18); nor was it far off; it was not in heaven - i.e. though heavenly in its source, it had not remained there, but had been revealed - so that there was no need for any one to say, Who will ascend to heaven, and bring it down to us, that we may hear it, and do it? The idea is not, as Keil suggests, that of \"an inaccessible height\" which none could scale; nor is it, as suggested by Knobel, that of something \"incomprehensible, impracticable, and superhuman;\" it is simply a statement of fact that the Law had not been retained in heaven, but had been revealed to men. Nor was this revelation made in some far distant place across the sea, so that any need say, Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? On the contrary, it was very near to them, had been disclosed in words so that they could utter it with their own mouth, converse over it, and ponder it in their hearts (cf. Isaiah 45:19; Jeremiah 23:28; Romans 10:6). In the allusion to the sea, the representation is not that of depth (Targum Jon.), but that of distance.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIt is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy30:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSee, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-20. - Moses concludes by solemnly adjuring the people, as he had set before them, in his proclamation of the Law and in his preaching, good and evil, life and death, to choose the former and eschew the latter, to love and serve the Lord which is life, and to shun apostasy and disobedience which are death (cf.

The meaning is not that he \"went away\" into the tent of teaching, as one of the Targums explains it (London Polyglot, tom. 4. p. 377), which does not agree with what follows; nor is \"went\" merely equivalent to \"moreover;\" nor is it simply redundant; - it intimates that the speaking was consequent on Moses having arranged, disposed, or set himself to speak (cf. Exodus 2:1; Joshua 9:4; Job 1:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I am an hundred and twenty years old this day. When Moses stood before Pharaoh he was eighty years old (Exodus 7:7); since then forty years had elapsed during the wanderings in the wilderness. I can no more go out and come in; I am no longer able to work among and for the nation as I have hitherto done (cf. Numbers 27:17). This does not conflict with the statement in Deuteronomy 34:7, that up to the time of his death his eyes were not dim nor his natural strength abated, for this is the statement of an observer, and it often happens that an individual feels himself to be failing, when to those around him he appears to possess unabated vigor. There is no need, therefore, for resorting, with Raschi and others, to the expedient of reading \"for\" instead of \"and\" in the following clause; as if the cause why Moses could no longer go in and out among the people was God's prohibition of his going over Jordan. This is simply another and collateral reason why he had now to retire flora his post as leader.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-6. - But though Moses was no longer to be their leader, he assures them that the Lord would fulfill his engagement to conduct them to the possession of Canaan, even as he had already given them the territory of the kings of the Amorites; and he therefore exhorts them to be of good courage and fearlessly go forward to the conquest of the laud (cf.

Thou must go with this people. This is a correct rendering of the words as they stand in the Hebrew text. The Samaritan, Syriac, and Vulgate have, \"Thou shalt bring this people;\" but this is probably an arbitrary correction in order to assimilate this to ver. 23. And thou shalt cause them to inherit it; i.e. shalt conduct them to the full possession of the land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-13. - Moses turns next to the priests and the elders, and to them he commits the Law which he had written, with the injunction to read it to the people at the end of every seven years during the festival of the year of release, viz. at the Feast of Tabernacles (cf. Leviticus 23:34), when they appeared before the Lord. At the end of every seven years (cf. Deuteronomy 15:1). The Law was committed to the priests and elders, not merely to preserve it in safe keeping, but that they might see to its being observed by the people; else why commit it to the elders whose it was to administer rule in the nation, as well as to the priests who alone had access to the ark of the covenant where the Law was deposited? Moses \"entrusted the reading to the priesthood and the college of elders, as the spiritual and secular rulers of the congregation; and hence the singular, Thou shalt read this Law to all Israel\" (Keil). By the Law here is meant the Pentateuch; but it does not necessarily follow that the whole of the Pentateuch was to be thus read. As the reading was to be only once in seven years, it may be concluded that it was not so much for the information of the people that this was done, as for the purpose of publicly declaring, and by a solemn ceremony impressing on their minds the condition on which they held their position and privileges as the chosen people of the Lord; and for this the reading of select portions of the Torah would be sufficient. The Feast of Tabernacles was appointed as the season for the reading, doubtless because there was a connection between the end for which the Law was read and the spirit and meaning of that festival as a festival of rejoicing because of their deliverance from the uncertainty and unsettledness of their state in the wilderness, and their establishment in a well-ordered state where they could in peace and quietness enjoy the blessings which the bounty of God bestowed.

And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 14-23. - After nominating Joshua as his successor, and assigning the keeping of the Law to the priesthood and body of elders, Moses was summoned by the Lord to appear with Joshua in the tabernacle, that Joshua might receive a charge and appointment to his office. At the same time, God announced to Moses that after his death the people would go astray, and turn to idolatry, and violate the covenant, so that God's anger should be kindled against them, and he would leave them to suffer the consequences of their folly and sin. In view of this, Moses was directed to write a song and teach it to the people, that it might abide with them as a witness against them, rising up, as songs will do, in the memory of the nation, even after they had apostatized from the path in which the author of the song had led them. Verse 14. - The tabernacle of the congregation; properly, the tent of meeting (cf. Exodus 33:7; Exodus 39:32). May give him a charge; may constitute him (צִוָּה; cf.

Go a whoring (cf. Exodus 34:15; Judges 2:17) after the gods of the strangers of the land; literally, after gods of strangeness of the land; i.e. after gods foreign to the land, as opposed to Jehovah, the alone proper God of the land he had given to them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - I will hide my face from them; will not look on them with complacency, will withdraw from them my favor and help (cf.

This refers to the song which follows in next chapter. Moses and Joshua were both to write this song, Moses probably as the author, Joshua as his amanuensis, because both of them were to do their endeavor to keep the people from that apostasy which God had foretold.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And he gave, etc. The subject here is God, not Moses, as is evident partly from ver. 14, and partly from the expression, the land which I aware unto them; and I will be with thee (cf.

This was the finishing of the writing of the Book of the Law, and the committing it finally to the priests, to be by them placed by the ark of the covenant, that it might be kept for all future generations as a witness against the people, whose apostasy and rebellion were foreseen. Whether this section is to be regarded as wholly written by Moses himself, or as an appendix to his writing added by some other writer, has been made matter of question. It is quite possible, however, that Moses himself, ere he laid down the pen, may have recorded what he said when delivering the Book of the Law to the priests, and there is nothing in the manner or style of the record to render it probable that it was added by another. What follows from ver. 30 to the end of the book was probably added to the writing of Moses by some one after his death, though, of course, both the song in Deuteronomy 32, and the blessing in Deuteronomy 33, are the composition of Moses (see Introduction, § 6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - The Levites, which bare the ark; i.e. the priests whose business it was to guard and to carry the ark of the covenant; \"the priests the sons of Levi,\" as in ver. 9. According to Numbers 4:4, etc., it was the Kohathites who carried the ark on the journey through the desert; but they seem merely to have acted in this respect as the servants or helpers of the priests, who alone might touch the ark, and by whom it was carefully wrapped up before it was handed to the Kohathites. On special occasions the priests themselves carried the ark (cf. Joshua 3:3, etc.; Joshua 4:9, 10; 6:6, 12; 8:33; 1 Kings 8:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy31:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - In the side of the ark; at or by the side of the ark.

The latter days; the after-time, the future, as in Deuteronomy 4:30; Numbers 24:14, etc. The work of your hands; the idols they might make (cf. Deuteronomy 4:28).

The Hebrew verb here and in Deuteronomy 33:28 is properly rendered by\" drop;\" it expresses the gentle falling of a genial shower or the soft distillation of dew. The clause is best taken imperatively, as it is by the LXX., the Vulgate, and Onkelos: Let my doctrine drop as the rain, let my speech distil, etc. The point of comparison here is not the quickening, fructifying, vivifying influence of the rain and dew, so much as the effective force of these agents as sent from heaven to produce results. So might his doctrine come with power into the minds of his hearers. Doctrine (לֶקַה from לָקַח to take); that which takes one (Proverbs 7:21, \"fair speech,\" By which one is captivated), or which one takes or receives, viz. instruction (Proverbs 4:2; Isaiah 29:24). Small rain; gentle showers, such as conduce to the growing of herbs. The Hebrew word (שְׂעִידִים) primarily means hairs, and is here used of rain coming down in thin streams like hair. Showers; heavy rain (רִבִיבִים from רָבַב, to be much or many, equal to multitude of drops).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBecause I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I will publish the name of the Lord; literally, I will call, i.e. proclaim, or celebrate, etc. Ascribe ye greatness unto our God. The hearers of the song are summoned to join in the celebration of the Divine majesty. The word rendered\" greatness\" occurs only in this book (Deuteronomy 3:24; Deuteronomy 5:21; Deuteronomy 9:26; Deuteronomy 11:2), and in Psalm 150:2. It is the greatness of God as the Almighty that is here celebrated.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - He is the Rock, his work is perfect; rather, The Rock! his work is perfect, i.e. blameless, without fault. God is called \"the Rock\" (הַצוּר), as the unchangeable Refuge and Stronghold of his people, by which they are sustained, and to which they can resort for defense and protection at all times. The epithet is applied to God four times besides in this song (vers. 15, 18, 30, 31); it occurs also frequently in the Psalms (cf. Psalm 19:14; Psalm 28:1; Psalm 31:2, 3; Psalm 62:2, 7; etc.). The Hebrew word, tsur, gut, or zur, appears in several proper names of the Mosaic period, as e.g., Pedahzur, \"Rock delivers\" (Numbers 1:10), a name of the same import as Pedahel, \"God delivers\" (Numbers 34:28); Elizur, \"God is a Rock\" (Numbers 1:5); Zuriel (Numbers 3:35) and Zurishaddai, \"the Almighty is Rock\" (Numbers 1:6; Numbers 2:12). \"Jehovah,\" says Baumgarten, \"is here called Rock, without any qualification, the reason is that he is the only true rock, and all the strength and firmness of earth's stones is but an ectype of his unchangeable faithfulness and rectitude. If one cleaves to the dualism of spirit and nature, and regards the figure as a merely subjective, arbitrary union of the two, such an expression is simply unintelligible; but if we would understand Scripture and religious speech, we must with all earnestness accustom ourselves to recognize the spiritual ground in nature, and apprehend this in the Biblical expression (comp. Steffens' 'Religionsphilosophie,' 1. s. 101, 102).\" It is remarkable that none of the ancient versions have retained this epithet here. The LXX. have Θεὸς: the Vulgate, Dens (\"Dei opera\"); the Targum of Onkelos, תַּקִיפָא, \"Mighty;\" while the Peshito has simply the pronoun \"his\" appended to \"works,\" . For all his ways are judgment; i.e. accordant with rectitude (cf. Psalm 145:17). A God of truth; rather, of faithfulness (אְמֶוּנָת, from אָמַן, to stay, or be stayed, to be firm). They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation. Of this difficult passage the following seems the best construction and rendering: - A perverse and crooked generation not his children, [but] their spot - has become corrupt towards him. The subject of the verb at the beginning of the verse is the \"perverse and crooked generation,\" at the end of it, and between the verb and its subject there is interjected parenthetically the clause, \"not his children, but their spot.\" Spot is here used in a moral sense, as in Job 11:15; Job 31:7; Proverbs 9:7. These corrupt persons claimed to be children of God, but they were not; they were rather a stain and a reproach to them (cf. 2 Peter 2:13; Isaiah 1:4). The rendering above given is substantially that of De Wette, Knobel, Keil, and Herxheimer, by all of whom the \"perverse generation \"is regarded as the subject of the sentence. This is the view adopted also in the 'Speaker's Commentary.' Some would make \"God\" the subject, and render, \"He hath corrupted to him, or to himself\" (margin, Authorized Version; Ibn Ezra, etc.). Others take \"spot\" as the subject, thus: \"Their spot or blemish hath corrupted before him children not his\" (Lowth, Dathe); but such renderings are forced, and proceed on constructions of the text which are illegitimate. Donaldson ('Jashar,' pp. 186, 223, edit. See.), following Lowth's construction, appeals to בָּנִים לא אֵמֻן בָּם (ver. 20) as a similar inversion. But the two cases are not parallel. To make them so, we must have here בָנָיו לא מוּם בָּם, \"his children in whom is no spot.\" Ewald takes מוּמָה as the noun here, instead of מוּם, and tracing it to the Syriac , juravit, renders \"to him they, his not sons, have corrupted their oath,\" i.e. have broken it; and this Furst approves. But the phrase, \"to corrupt an oath\" is unexampled in the Old Testament, and there is no ground for changing the noun. The ancient versions vary considerably here: LXX., ἡμάρτοσαν οὐκ αὐτῷ τέκνα μωμητά: Aq., διέφθειραν αὐτῷ οὐκ δι υἱοὶ αὐτου: Sym., διέφθειραν πρὸς αὔτον οὐχ οἱυἱοι τὸ σύνολον: Vulgate, peccaverunt ei et non filii ejus in sordibus; Ver. Itala., peeca verunt non ei filii maculati; Syriac, \"They corrupted but not him, children of defilement.\" These various renderings indicate that probably the text is and has long been corrupt. Some of the older English versions are worth noting on this verse. Rogers [Matthew], \"The frowarde and overthwart generation hath marred them selves to himward, and are not his sonnes for their deformitie's sake;\" Bishop's Bible, \"Frowardly have they done agaynst him by their vices, not being his own children, but a wicked and froward generation;\" Geneva Version, \"They have corrupted themselves towards him by their vice, not being his children, but a froward and crooked generation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDo ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6, 7. - Instead of gratefully acknowledging the Divine beneficence, and dutifully obeying the Divine will, Israel had perversely and foolishly requited the Lord for all his benefits, by apostasy from him. Do ye thus requite? The verb here signifies primarily to do to any one either good or evil, whether in return for what he has done or not (cf. Genesis 1:15; 1 Samuel 24:18; Proverbs 3:30); then, as a secondary meaning, to reward, repay, requite, as here and Psalm 18:21. To bring more forcibly to their view the ingratitude and folly of their conduct, Moses dwells upon what God was and had been to the nation: their Father, in that he had, in his love, chosen, them to be his people (cf. Isaiah 63:16; Isaiah 64:7; Malachi 2:10); their Purchaser, who had acquired possession of them by delivering them out of Egypt (cf. Psalm 74:2); their Maker, who had constituted them a nation; and their Establisher, by whom they had been conducted through the wilderness and settled in Canaan. Days of old; the times of Israel's deliverance from bondage, and the times during which successive generations had lived and experienced the goodness of the Lord. The form of the word rendered \"days\" is poetical, and is found only here and in Psalm 90:15, which is also ascribed to Moses. The years of many generations; literally, years of generation and generation; \"aetatum singularum annos\" (Rosenmüller).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8, 9. - From the very beginning, when God first allotted to the nations a place and a heritage, he had respect in his arrangements to the sons of Israel, who were his portion, and had as it were kept their interest in view in all that he appointed and ordered. According to the number of the children of Israel. When the Most High portioned out to the nations the heritage of each, he reserved for Israel, as the people of his choice, an inheritance proportioned to its numbers. The LXX. has \"according to the number of the angels of God,\" an arbitrary departure from the original text, in accommodation, probably, to the later Jewish notion of each nation having its guardian angel. The Lord's portion is his people (cf. Exodus 15:16; Exodus 19:5; 1 Samuel 10:1; Psalm 78:71). The lot of his inheritance; literally, the cord, etc., the allusion being to the measuring of land by a cord, equivalent to the portion by measure which Jehovah allotted to himself as his inheritance (cf. Psalm 16:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD'S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - God's fatherly care of Israel. In the desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; literally, in the land of the desert, in the waste (the formless waste; the word used is that rendered, Genesis 1:2, \"without form\"), the howling of the wilderness. \"Israel is figuratively represented as a man without food or water, and surrounded by howling, ferocious beasts, and who must needs have perished had not God found him and rescued him\" (Herxheimer). The apple of his eye; literally, the mannikin (אִישׁון) of his eye, the pupil; so called because in it, as in a mirror, a person sees his own image reflected in miniature (Gesenius), or because, being the tenderest part of the eye, it is guarded as one would a babe (cf. Psalm 17:8; Proverbs 7:2; Zechariah 2:12). By Delitzsch and others this explanation of the word is rejected as not philologically justified, there being no evidence that the termination ון had a diminutive force; and as not in keeping with the earnestness of the passages in which this word occurs. They prefer the explanation man image to mannikin. Anyhow, the use of the word here must be taken as indicating that Israel is ever in the eye of the Lord, the object of his constant and tenderest care.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - God's treatment of his people is compared to that of an eagle towards its young (cf. Exodus 19:4). In the Authorized Version, the apodosis of the sentence is made to begin at ver. 12, and ver. 11 is wholly understood of the eagle and its young. To this arrangement it has been objected that it overlooks the fact that the suffixes to the verbs \"taketh\" and \"beareth\" are singulars, and are to be understood consequently, not of the eaglets, but of Israel. It has, therefore, been proposed to render the passage thus: As an eagle which stirreth up its nest, fluttereth over its young, he spread out his wings, took him up, and carried him on his pinions. The Lord alone did lead him, etc. The comparison is thus made to pass into a metaphorical representation of the Lord's dealing with Israel. One feels that there is something violent in this, for whilst God's care for Israel might be fittingly compared to that of an eagle towards her young, it is less fit to speak of God himself as if he were an eagle with wings which he spread abroad and on which he bare Israel. The rendering in the Authorized Version is on this account to be preferred, if it can be grammatically vindicated. And this it may on the ground that the suffixes may be understood of the \"nest\" as containing the young (\"continens pro contento,\" a common rhetorical trope in Scripture; see Glass., 'Philippians Sac.,' p. 686; cf. Virgil, 'AEneid,' 12:475, \"nidisque loquacibus escam\"); or the young may be referred to individually, \"taketh it, beareth it,\" i.e. each of them; or, if the nest be understood, the whole body of them as therein contained. Stirreth up her [its] nest i.e. its nestlings; provocans ad volandum pullos suos, Vulgate. This is the explanation usually given of the initial clause of this verse; but its accuracy has been questioned, Furst would render the verb by \"watchesover; \"but though הֵעִיר, as the Hiph. of עוּר, to watch, may have this meaning, it is undoubtedly used generally in the sense of rousing, exciting, stirring up. Knobel retains this meaning, but understands the clause of the exciting of the nestlings by the parent bird coming to them with food. This is certainly more in keeping with what follows; for when the eagle nestles or broods over her young, she does not excite them to fly. Fluttereth over her young; rather, broods over, nestles, or cherishes (יְרַחֵפ). Spreadeth abroad her wings, etc. \"I once saw a very interesting sight above one of the crags of Ben Nevis, as I was going in pursuit of black game. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of a mountain, in the eye of the sun; - it was about midday, and bright for this climate. They at first made small circles, and the young imitated them; they paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their first flight, holding them on their expanded wings when they appeared exhausted, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising towards the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight, so as to make a gradually ascending spiral\" (Davy, 'Salinertia;' see also Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 2:181). The general reference is to God's fostering care of Israel, and especially his dealing with them when \"he suffered their manners in the wilderness\" (Acts 13:18), disciplined them, and trained them for what they were appointed to do.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The Lord alone did lead him (cf. Exodus 13:21; Exodus 15:13). With him; i.e. along with Jehovah, as aiding him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - He made him ride on the high places of the earth. To ride over or drive over the heights of a country is figuratively to subjugate and take possession of that country (cf. Deuteronomy 33:29; Isaiah 58:14). Israel, having subjugated Canaan, could eat of its produce, the increase of the fields, as his own. Honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock. Canaan abounded in wild bees, which had their hives in crevices of the rock, and in olive trees, which grew on a rocky soil; as is still the case in Palestine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTButter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Butter of kine. The Hebrew word (חֶמְאָה) here used designates milk in a solid or semi-solid state, as thick cream, curd, or butter. As distinguished from this is the milk of sheep; where the word used (חָלָב) properly denotes fresh milk, milk in a fluid state, and with all its richness (חֶלֶב, fatness) in it (cf. Genesis 18:8; Isaiah 7:22). Fat of lambs; lambs of the best, \"fat\" being a figurative expression for the best (Numbers 18:12). Rams of the breed of Bashan; literally, rams, sons of Bashan; i.e. reared in Bashan, a district famous for its cattle. With the fat of kidneys of wheat; with the kidney-fat of wheat; i.e. the richest fat, the best and most nutritious wheat. And thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. The blood of the grape is the expressed juice of the grape, which, being red, is compared to blood. The rendering \"pure\" here is not inapt. The original word (חֶמֶר, from חָמַר, to boil up, to foam, to rise in bubbles) describes this juice as it appears when pressed into a vessel, when the surface of the liquid is covered with froth or foam. There is no ground for the explanation \"fery wine\" (Keil); wine in such a state was never among the Hebrews counted a blessing. That they had and used fermented wine is certain; but what they specially esteemed as a luxury was the pure unadulterated juice of the grape freshly pressed out and drunk with the foam on it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-18. - Israel's ungrateful return for the Lord's benefits. Verse 15. - Jeshurun. This name, formed from יָשַׂר, righteous, designates Israel as chosen to be a righteous nation; and in the use of it here lies the keenest reproach of apostate Israel, as fallen into a state the opposite of that to which it was destined. \"By using the name righteous in place of Israel, Moses ironically censures those who had swerved from rectitude; by recalling to memory with what dignity they had been endowed, he the more sharply rebukes the perfidy which was their crime\" (Calvin). This name appears also in Deuteronomy 33:5, 26, and in Isaiah 44:2; but in these places without any implied censure. By some the word is regarded as a diminutive from יָשׂוּר, the same as יָשָׂר, in the sense of rectulus, justulus, \"the good little people\" (Gesenius); others as a diminutive from XXX, Israel, as a sort of term of endearment (Grotius). But the latter of these derivations is impossible; and as to the former, there lacks evidence of the termination un having a diminutive significance in Hebrew. Besides, neither here nor in Deuteronomy 33:5 would a term of endearment be suitable. Waxed fat, and kicked (cf. Deuteronomy 6:11; Deuteronomy 8:10; Deuteronomy 31:20). The allusion is to an ox that had grown fat through good feeding, and had become unmanageable in consequence (cf. 1 Samuel 2:26: Hosea 10:4). Lightly esteemed. The Hebrew is strongly expressive here: Thou hast treated as a fool (נִבֵּל, from נָבַל to be foolish (cf. Micah 7:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - They provoked him to jealousy. God had bound Israel to himself as by the marriage bond, and they by their unfaithfulness had incited him to jealousy (cf. Deuteronomy 31:16; Exodus 34:15; Isaiah 54:5; Hosea 1, etc.). Strange gods (cf. Jeremiah 2:25; Jeremiah 3:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Devils; shedim, a word which occurs only here and Psalm 106:37. It stands connected with the verb שׁוּד, to rule, and means primarily \"lords.\" The LXX. render by δαιμόνια, demons. In Assyrian it is said to be a name for demigods. Not to God; rather, to a not God, a composite term in apposition to shedim; the meaning is rightly given in the margin of the Authorized Version, \"which were not God.\" To new gods that came newly up. The word rendered by \"newly\" (קָרוב) properly means \"near;\" it is an adjective both of place and of time; here it is the latter, equal to of a near time, recently - gods recently invented or discovered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOf the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Moses here returns to the thought of ver. 15, for the purpose of expressing it with greater force, and also of leading on to the description he is about to give of the Lord's acts towards the nation who had so revolted from him. Thou art unmindful; LXX., ἐγκατέλιπες: Vulgate, dereliquisti. The Hebrew word שָׁיָה occurs only here, and the meaning is doubtful. From the rendering of the versions, it would seem to be allied to the Arabic , saha, oblitus est. That formed thee; literally, that brought thee forth or caused thee to be born; \"qui te eduxit ex utero materno\" (Jarchi. Cf. for the use of the verb, Psalm 29:9). In the Samaritan Codex, מהלל, \"who hath glorified or praised thee,\" is the reading, instead of מחלל; and this the Syriac also expresses. The other versions, however, support the Masoretic reading.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19-33. - Because of their rebellion. God would cast them off and visit them with terrible calamities.

A very froward generation, etc.; literally, a generation of perversities, an utterly perverse and faithless race.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - (Cf. Deuteronomy 5:16.) Because they had moved God to jealousy and provoked him to anger by their vanities, their nothingnesses, mere vapors and empty exhalations (הִבְלָים; cf. Jeremiah 10:6; John 2:8; 1 Corinthians 8:4); as they had forsaken him for a no-God, he would send retribution on them by adopting as his a no-people, and giving to a foolish nation, i.e. a nation not before possessed of that true wisdom the beginning of which is the fear of the Lord, the privileges and blessings which Israel had forfeited by their apostasy. By \"a no-people\" is not to be understood a savage tribe not yet formed into a community, but a people without God, and not recognized by him as in covenant union with him (cf. Romans 10:19; Ephesians 2:12; 1 Peter 2:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - (Cf. Jeremiah 15:14; Jeremiah 17:4; Lamentations 4:11.) The lowest hell; the lowest sheol, the uttermost depth of the under-world. The Hebrew sheol (שְׁאול) answering to the Greek ἅδης, by which it is usually rendered by the LXX., is a general designation of the unseen state, the place of the dead. By some the word is derived from שָׁאַל, to ask, because sheol is ever asking, is insatiable (Proverbs 30:16); but more probably it is from a root signifying to excavate, to hollow, and, like the German holle, means primarily a hollow place or cavern. The Divine wrath kindles a consuming fire, that burns down to the lowest depths - to the deepest part of sheol - consumes the earth's produce, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains. This does not refer to any particular judgment that was to befall the national Israel, but is a general description of the effects of the Divine wrath when that is poured forth in judgments on men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - I will spend mine arrows upon them; I will inflict on them so many calamities that none shall remain. The evils sent on men by God are represented as arrows shot on them from above. (Cf. ver. 42; Job 6:4; Psalm 7:13; Psalm 38:2; Psalm 45:5; Psalm 58:7; Zechariah 9:14; Homer, 'Iliad,' 1:45, etc.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - The evils threatened are famine, pestilence, plague, wild beasts, poisonous reptiles, and war. They shall be burnt with hunger, etc.; render: Sucked out by hunger, consumed with pestilential heat, and bitter plague; I will send against them the tooth of beasts and the poison of things that crawl in the dust. When hunger, pestilence, and contagious disease had wasted and exhausted them, then God would send on them wild beasts and poisonous reptiles. Shall be burnt. The Hebrew word occurs only here; it is a verbal adjective, meaning, literally, sucked out, i.e. utterly exhausted; LXX., τηκομένοι λιμῷ. Tooth of beasts and poison of serpents; poetical for ravenous and poisonous animals ¢cf. Leviticus 26:22). Shall destroy; literally, shall make childless, shall bereave, viz. the land which is thought of as a mother whose children were destroyed. The verb is here sensu prsegnanti, shall bereave by destroying, etc. (cf. 1 Samuel 15:23; Lamentations 1:20; Jeremiah 18:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26, 27. - Israel's desert was to be utterly destroyed, but God refrained from this for his own Name's sake. I said, I would scatter them into corners; rather, I should say, I trill blow them away, i.e. disperse them as by a mighty wind. The verb here is the Hiph, of פָאָה, to breathe, to blow, and is found only here. The rabbins make it a denominative from פֵאָה, a corner, and this the Authorized Version follows; others trace it to an Arabic root, פאא, amputavit, excidit, and render, \"will cut them off.\" The idea intended to be conveyed is obviously that of entire destruction, and this is not satisfied by the representation of their being scared or driven into corners. Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy. Various renderings and interpretations of this passage have been given.NEWLINENEWLINE1. Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, i.e. that I should be provoked to wrath by the enemy ascribing the destruction of Israel to their own prowess.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Were it not that I feared a wrath upon the enemy, with much the same meaning.NEWLINENEWLINE3. Were it not that I feared the fury of the enemy, i.e. against Israel - feared lest the enemy should be encouraged to rise up against Israel and ascribe their destruction to their own valor. Of these that most generally approved is the first. (On this reason for sparing Israel, see Deuteronomy 9:28; Exodus 32:12; Numbers 14:13, etc.; Isaiah 10:5, etc.; Ezekiel 20:13, 14.) Should behave themselves strangely; rather, should mistake or falsely pretend. The verb is the Piel of נָכַר, to look upon, to mark, and conveys the idea of looking on askance or prejudicially, hence being ignorant of, mistaking, feigning, or falsely pretending. Our hand is high; rather, was high, i.e. was mighty in power. Vers 28-33. - The cause of Israel's rejection was that they were a people utterly destitute of counsel and without understanding. Had they been wise, they would have looked to the end, and acted in a way conducive to their own welfare, instead of rushing upon ruin.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWere it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - Oh that they were wise, that they understood this; rather, If they were wise they would understand this.

Exodus 14:25; Numbers 33, 34; Joshua 2:9; 1 Samuel 5:7). Moses is here himself again the speaker.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 32. - If the Rock of Israel was so much mightier than the rock of their enemies, how came it that Israel was beaten and put to flight by their enemies? The reason is here given: It was because Israel had become wholly corrupt and vitiated that they were forsaken of the Lord and left to the power of their enemies. Their vine; i.e. Israel itself (cf. Psalm 80:9, etc.; Isaiah 5:2; Jeremiah 2:21; Hosea 10:1 ). The vine of Sodom. It has been supposed that there is reference here to a particular plant, and different plants have been suggested as deserving to be so named. But it is more probable that Sodom and Gomorrah are here advanced as types of what is depraved, and to the moral taste nauseous (cf. Isaiah 1:10; Jeremiah 23:14). Gall (cf. Deuteronomy 29:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTheir wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - The wine of these grapes is poison and venom. Dragons; tannin (cf. Exodus 7:9, 10). Cruel [deadly] venom of asps. The pethen, one of the most poisonous of snakes, the bite of which was immediately fatal (Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:494; Smith's 'Dict.,' 1:21). These figures express the thought that Israel had utterly corrupted their way and become abominable; probably also it is intimated that, as they had imitated the impiety of the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, they deserved to perish as they did (J.H. Michaelis).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:34VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIs not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 34-43. - Notwithstanding the iniquity of Israel and the judgments that should come upon them, God would have compassion upon them for his Name's sake, and would appear for their vindication and defense. The \"this\" in ver. 34 is by some understood of the sinful doings of the Israelites which God should not forget or overlook. So the Targum of Onkelos: \"Are not all their works manifest before me, kept against the day of judgment in my treasures?\" So also Calvin, \"Quanquam de poenis hunc versum quidam exponunt, acsi Deus assereret diversas earum species apud se paratas esse, quas depromat quoties libuerit: rectius tamen est de sceleribus intelligere.\" But there is a more 'comprehensive reference here. Not only the deeds of the transgressors, but the judgments that should come on Israel, and also God's interposition on their behalf, were laid up in store with him, and sealed up among his treasures. All that had been done had been noted, and all that should happen was decreed, and should certainly come to pass. The \"this' has thus both a retrospective and a prospective reference; it includes both the sin of the nation and God's dealing with them afterwards, as well as his judgments on their enemies. Verse 34. - My treasures. God's treasures contain not only a store of blessing, but also instruments of punishment, which as he sees meet, he sends forth on men (cf. Deuteronomy 28:12; Job 38:22, 23; Psalm 135:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:35VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 35. - Render: Vengeance is mine, and retribution for the time when their feet shall totter; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and that which is prepared for them maketh haste. The tottering of the feet represents the incipient fall. God would manifest himself as the Avenger when their calamity began to come upon them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:36VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 36. - The Lord shall judge his people (cf. Psalm 135:14; 1 Peter 4:17). And repent himself for his servants; rather, and have compassion upon his servants. And there is none shut up, or left. The words rendered \"shut up or left\" are a proverbial expression for \"every one, men of all sorts\" (cf. 1 Kings 14:10; 1 Kings 21:21; 2 Kings 9:8; 2 Kings 14:26); but how the words are to be rendered or explained is uncertain. Rosenmüller renders as in the Authorized Version; Gesenius has, \"the shut up and the let go free, the bond and the flee;\" so also Furst and De Wette; De Dieu, \"married and single, conjugatus et coelebs,\" referring to the Arabic usage in support of his conclusion ('Animad. in Ver. Test.,' p. 114), and this Keil approves. Ewald has \"kept in (by legal impurity) or at large.\" The explanation of Gesenius and Furst seems best.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - The Lord would show his people the utter worthlessness of idols, and bring them to acknowledge him as the only true God.

The Hebrew is more expressive, See now that I, I am; LXX., ἴδετε ἴδετε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι (cf. Isaiah 41:4; Isaiah 48:12; John 8:24 18:5). Their own experience of the utter impotency of these idol-gods to help them or to protect themselves flora the stroke of the Almighty was enough to convince them that they were no gods, and that he alone was to be feared and worshipped.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:40VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 40, 41. - These verses should be read continuously: For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, As I live forever, if I whet my glittering sword, and if my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, etc. Lifting up the hand to heaven was a gesture intended to express that the person taking an oath appealed to God as a witness of his oath, and who would perish for falsehood (cf. Genesis 14:22); and \"as the Lord liveth\" was a common formula in taking an oath (cf. Numbers 14:21; 1 Samuel 14:39, 45; Jeremiah 5:2). As God could swear by none greater, he swore by himself (cf. Exodus 6:8; Numbers 14:30; Isaiah 45:23; Jeremiah 22:5; Hebrews 6:17), that if he did come forth to avenge himself of his enemies, he would not spare, but would do thoroughly what he had come forth to do. - Glittering sword; literally, lightning of sword (cf. Ezekiel 21:10 [15]).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:41VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:42VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 42. - My sword shall devour flesh; literally, shall eat flesh; \"the edge of the sword is called its mouth, because, like a mouth, it is said to eat and devour\" (Gesenius). From the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. Different renderings of this have been given: LXX., ἀπὸ κεφαλῆς ἀρχόντων ἐχθρῶν, \"from the head of the hostile princes;\" \"from the head of the chiefs of the enemy\" (Geseuius, Furst, Rosenmüller); \"from the hairy head of the foe\" (Keil, Herxheimer, Knobel). פְרַעות, the plural of פֶרַע, hair, locks, signifies primarily hairs, and a head of hairs, and may be taken as equivalent to \"a hairy head;\" but the word is also used in the sense of \"princes\" or \"chiefs\" (probably because such were distinguished by copious flowing locks; cf. Judges 5:2); hence the rendering, \"head of the chiefs.\" The former is to be preferred here, for why chiefs or princes should be referred to in this connection does not appear (cf. Psalm 68:22). The rendering of the Authorized Version is wholly unauthorized. This verse presents an instance of alternate parallelism; each half falls into two members, and of the four members thus constituted, the third corresponds to the first, and the fourth to the second; thus -NEWLINENEWLINEa \"I will make my arrows drunk with blood,NEWLINENEWLINEb And my sword shall devour flesh;NEWLINENEWLINEa' With the blood of the slain and the captives,NEWLINENEWLINEb' From the hairy head of the foe.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:43VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 43. - \"As this song commenced with an appeal to heaven and earth to give glory to the Lord (vers. 1-3), so it very suitably closes with an appeal to the heathen to rejoice with his people on account of the acts of the Lord\" (Keil). Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people. The Authorized Version here follows the LXX., εὐφράνθητε ἔθνη μετὰ τοῦ λαοῦ αὐτοῦ, and so St. Paul cites the passage in Romans 15:10. The Jewish interpreters generally render, Praise his people, O nations; and this several Christian interpreters adopt. But as Rosenmüller remarks, it is the Divine righteousness manifested in the vindication of his people from their enemies that is to be celebrated, and not the people themselves, as what follows shows. Here as elsewhere the nations and the people are in contrast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:44VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 44-47. - Moses, having composed this song, came, accompanied by Joshua, and they together spoke it in the hearing of the people; after which Moses took occasion to urge upon them anew the importance of keeping the commandments of God. Verse 44. - Hoshea the son of Nun. Moses invariably writes this name Jehoshuah (Jehovah is help; cf. Numbers 13; Deuteronomy 31:3, 7, 14, 20, etc.). The use of Hoshea here is due to the fact that this account is part of the supplement added by another writer to the writing of Moses.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:45VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy32:46VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 46. - (Cf.

This appellation is applied to Moses only here and in Joshua 14:6 and the heading of Psalm 90. The phrase, \"man of God,\" indicates one favored with Divine communications, and employed as God's messenger to men (cf. 1 Samuel 9:6; 1 Kings 12:22). In this heading, the author of the blessing is clearly distinguished from the person by whom it was inserted in this place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And he said. Here begin the words of Moses. He commences by depicting the majesty of Jehovah as he appeared to Israel when he came to make the covenant with them and give them his Law. The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them, etc. Seir is the mountain land of Edom to the cast of Sinai. Mount Paran is probably the range of lofty hills which form the southern boundary of the Promised Land to the north of the desert of Et-Tih. These places are not mentioned as scenes of different manifestations of the Divine glory, but as indicating the extent to which the one manifestation given at Sinai reached. The light of the Divine glory that rested on Sinai was reflected also from the mountains of Seir and Paran (cf. Hebrews 3:3; Judges 5:4). He came with ten thousands of saints; rather, he came from ten thousands of holy ones; literally, out from myriads of holiness; i.e. \"from his celestial seat, where myriads of angels surround his throne\" (Rosenmüller). The rendering \"with,\" though that of the Targum, LXX., and Vulgate, cannot be retained; nor does Scripture represent God as attended by angels when he comes forth to manifest his glory to men. They are represented as surrounding his throne in heaven (1 Kings 22:19; Job 1:6; Daniel 7:10), as his servants awaiting his behest, and his host that do his pleasure (Genesis 28:12; Genesis 32:2, 3; Psalm 103:21); and God is represented as dwelling in the midst of them (Psalm 68:17). Hence he is represented here as coming forth from among them to manifest himself to his people. A fiery law. There is a various reading here; instead of אֵשׁ םדּת, fire of law, many codices have אשׁדת in one word, and this is supported by the Samaritan text and other authorities, and is accepted by most critics and interpreters. It is a fatal objection to the textual reading that דַּת is not a Semitic word, but one of Persian origin, brought by the Jews from Babylonia, and found only in the post-exilian books (Esther 1:8, 19; Esther 2:8, 12; Esther 3:8, 14; Esther 4:11, 15; Ezra 7:12, 21; Ezra 8:36; Daniel 2:9, 13, 15; Daniel 6:5, 9, 13, 16); and in them as applied to the Law of God only by heathens. It is, therefore, altogether improbable that this word should be found in any Hebrew writing anterior to the Captivity. Besides, what is the sense of אֵשׁ דַּת, supposing דת to mean \"law?\" The words cannot be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, by \"fiery law;\" they can only be rendered by \"a fire, a law,\" or \"a fire of law,\" and What either of these may mean it is not easy to see. The ancient versions vary here very considerably: LXX., ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ ἄγγελοι μετ αὐτοῦ: Vulgate, fin dextera ejus ignea lex; Targum of Onkelos, \"Written by his right hand, from the midst of the fire, a law gave he to us;\" Syriac, \"With myriads of his saints at his right hand. He gave to them, and also caused all peoples to love them.\" The best Hebrew manuscripts have אשׁדת as one word. The Masoretic note is, \"The Chatiph is one word, and the K'ri two.\" The word אשׁדת is best explained as a compound of אֵשׁ, fire, and שׁדא, an Aramaic word signifying to throw or dart; the Syriac , or the Hebrew יָדָה, having the same signification, so that the meaning is \"fire-dartings:\" from his right hand went rays of fire like arrows shot forth (cf. Habakkuk 3:4; Exodus 19:16). To them; i.e. to the Israelites, to whom this manifestation was vouchsafed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Yea, he loved the people. The proper rendering is, he loveth peoples (עַמִּים). This is generally understood of the tribes of Israel; but some would understand it of nations in general, on the ground that such is the proper meaning of the word, as in Deuteronomy 32:8 and other places. A reference to nations at large, however, would seem incongruous here; and the use of the word in relation to Israel in such passages as Genesis 28:3; Judges 5:14; Isaiah 3:13; Hoe. 10:14; Zechariah 11:10, justifies the taking it so here. All his saints are in thy hand. The people of Israel are here called God's saints, or holy ones, because they were chosen by and consecrated to him. It is not probable, as some suggest, that the angels are here intended. The change from the third person to the second is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (cf. Deuteronomy 32:15; Psalm 49:14, etc.). They sat down at thy feet. The verb rendered \"sat down\" here (תֻּכּוּ) is found only in this passage, and is of uncertain meaning. Kimchi explains it as \"they united or assembled together to follow thy steps;\" Knobel makes it \"they wandered at thy feet,\" and understands it of Israel's following the lead of Jehovah in the wilderness, when the ark of the covenant preceded them in their march; Gesenius and Furst, \"they lie down at thy feet.\" This last is accepted by Keil, and seems to have most in its favor. Every one shall receive of thy words. Some render here, they rise up at thy words; but though the verb נָשַׂא is sometimes used intransitively, it is properly an active verb, and there seems no reason why it should not be so regarded here: every one receives [the singular, יִשַּׂא, used distributively] thy words.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Moses here, identifying himself with the people, uses the third person, and includes himself among those to whom the Law was given; cf. Psalm 20, 21, where David not only speaks of himself in the third person, but addresses such prayers for himself as could only be offered by the people for their king (cf. also Judges 5:12, 15; Habakkuk 3:19). Even the inheritance of the congregation. The \"even,\" which the translators of the Authorized Version have inserted here, were better omitted; the words are in apposition to \"law.\" The Law which Moses communicated to Israel was to remain with them as the inheritance f the congregation. The Bishops' Bible and the Geneva Version have, more correctly, \"for an inheritance of the congregation.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Some refer this to Moses, but Moses was never recognized as king in Israel: he \"was faithful in all his house as a servant\" (Hebrews 3:5); but Jehovah alone was King (Exodus 15:18; Psalm 47:6, 7). Jeshurun (cf. Deuteronomy 32:5). The gathering together refers to the assembling of the people at Sinai, when Jehovah came forth as their King to give them his Law.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 6-25. - Blessings on the tribes individually. With these may be compared the blessing which Jacob pronounced on his sons as representing the tribes of which they were the heads. The two resemble each other in many points; the differences are such as naturally arose from the different relations of the speakers to the objects of their address, and the changes in the condition and prospects of the tribes which during the lapse of centuries had come to pass. Verse 6. - And let not his men be few. The negative, though not expressed in the Hebrew, is to be carried into this clause from the preceding. Though the rights of primogeniture had been withdrawn from Reuben, and Jacob had declared that he should not excel, Moses here assures the tribe of continuance, and even prosperity. Their number was not to be small; which was, perhaps, said to comfort them, in view of the fact that their numbers had greatly diminished in the course of their wanderings in the desert (comp. Numbers 1:21 with Numbers 26:7). At no time, however, was this tribe numerous as compared with the others; nor was it ever distinguished either by the enterprise of its members or by the eminence of any of them in the councils of the nation or the management of affairs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The blessing on Judah is in the form of prayer to Jehovah. As Jacobhad promised to Judah supremacy over his brethren and success in war, so Moses here names him next after Reuben, whose pre-eminence he had assumed, and prays for him that, going forth at the head of the tribes, he might return in triumph, being helped of the Lord. Let his hands be sufficient for him; rather, with his hands he contendeth for it (to wit, his people). רַב here is not the adj. much, enough, but the part. of the verb רִיב, to contend, to strive; and יָדָיו is the aeons, of instrument. The rendering in the Authorized Version is grammatically possible; but the meaning thereby brought out is not in keeping with the sentiment of the passage; for if Judah's hands, i.e. his own power and resources, were sufficient for him, what need had he of help from the Lord?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-11. - The blessing on Levi is also in the form of a prayer. In Jacob's blessing, Simeon is joined with Levi, but Moses passes him over altogether, probably because, as Jacob foretold, he was to be scattered among his brethren (Genesis 49:7), and so lose his tribal individuality. Simeon, however, is included in the general blessing pronounced on Israel; and as this tribe received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (Joshua 19:2-9), it was probably regarded as included in the blessing on that tribe. Thy Thummim and thy Urim; thy Right and thy Light (cf. Exodus 28:30). The high priest wore the breast-plate on which these were placed when he went in before the Lord; and this is here represented as the prerogative of the whole tribe. Thy holy one; i.e. Levi, the tribe-father, representing the whole tribe to which the blessing applies; hence in the following verses the verb passes into the plural. For \"holy one,\" it would be better to read \"pious\" or \"godly one;\" literally, the man thy pious one. Some would render \"the man thy favored one,\" or \"the man of thy friendship;\" but this is wholly arbitrary, the word (חָסִיד) has no such meaning. To explain this more particularly, reference is made to the trials at Massah and the waters of Meribah (strife), when the people rebelled and murmured against Moses and Aaron, whereby the piety of these men was put to the test, and in them, the heads of the tribe of Levi, the whole tribe was proved. (On Massah, see Exodus 17:1-7; and on the waters of strife, see Numbers 20:1-13.) In these trials, Levi had proved himself faithful and godly, having risen up in defense of the honor of Jehovah, and in support of his covenant, though in the latter case both Moses and Aaron stumbled. Who said unto his father and to his mother, etc. This refers to what is narrated in Exodus 32:26-29, when the Levites drew their swords against their brethren at the command of Moses, to execute judgment without respect of person, because of the sin of the people in the matter of the golden calf (cf. also Numbers 25:8, and, for the principle here implicitly commended, see Matthew 10:37; Matthew 19:29; Luke 14:26). Because of their zealous devotion to the claims and service of the Lord, the dignity of the priesthood had been conferred on this tribe; and to them belonged the high office of being instructors of the people in Divine things, and of presenting the sacrifices of the people to the Lord. For those entrusted with such an office, nothing was more to be desired than that they should be blessed with power rightly to discharge the duties of their office, that their service should be accepted with favor, and that their enemies and haters should be foiled and rendered impotent; and for this Moses prays on their behalf.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThey shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the LORD shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Benjamin, the beloved of his father, is also the beloved of the Lord, and would be cared for and protected by him. Shall dwell in safety by him; shall dwell securely upon him, i.e. resting on him. Shall cover him. The word rendered \"cover\" (חַפַפ) occurs only here; construed with עַל, upon, it conveys the idea of sheltering: he continually is sheltering him. And he shall dwell between his shoulders. \"To be between the shoulders\" is to be carried on the back (cf. 1 Samuel 17:6); and as a father might thus bear his child, so should Benjamin be borne of the Lord. There can be no doubt that Benjamin is the subject of this clause; to understand it of Jehovah dwelling on the shoulders of Benjamin, in the sense of having the temple, the place of his rest, within the territory of Benjamin, is too violent and far-fetched an interpretation to be admitted. In the change of subject in the three clauses of this verse, there is nothing strange, since such a change repeatedly occurs, and is found even in prose, as e.g., 2 Samuel 11:13. \"To dwell upon God, and between his shoulders, means as much as to lean upon him; the similitude being taken from fathers who carry their sons while yet small and tender\" (Calvin).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 13-17. - The blessing on Joseph by Moses closely resembles that pronounced by Jacob on his favorite son; he solicits for him the utmost abundance of temporal blessing, and the riches of the Divine favor. There is this difference, however, between the two blessings, that in that of the patriarch it is the growth of the tribe in power and might that is chiefly contemplated; whilst in that of Moses it is the advance of the tribe in wealth, prosperity, and influence that is chiefly indicated. \"Jacob described the growth of Joseph under the figure of a luxuriant branch of a fruit tree planted by the water; whilst Moses fixes his eye primarily upon the land of Joseph, and desires for him the richest productions\" (Keil). For the precious things of heaven, for the dew. Several codices, for מטל, \"for dew,\" read מעל, above - \"the precious things of heaven above;\" and this reading, some critics of eminence adopt. Probably, however, this is only a correction, to bring this passage into accordance with Genesis 49:25. The Targums and the Peshito combine both readings. Instead of \"for the precious things,\" it is better to read \"with,\" etc., and so throughout vers. 13-16. Literally, it is from, etc.; מִמֶּגֶד, the מ expressing the instrumental cause of the blessing, of which the Lord is the efficient cause. The noun מֶגֶד, literally, excellency, preciousness, occurs only here and in Song of Solomon 4:13, 16 and Cant 7:13, where it is rendered by \"pleasant.\" The precious fruit of the heavens is the dew, which, with the waters stored up in the recesses of the earth, furthers the growth of the earth's produce, ripened by the influences of sun and moon. And for the chief things of the ancient mountains; literally, and from the head of the mountains of old. The precious things of the mountains and hills are the vines and olive trees with which the lower slopes are adorned, and the forests that crown the loftier. The good will of him that dwelt in the bush. The reference is to the appearance of Jehovah to Moses in the bush at Horeb (Exodus 3.), when he manifested himself as the Deliverer of Israel, whose good pleasure it was that they should be redeemed from bondage and favored with blessing. That was separated from his brethren; separated in the sense of consecrated, or distinguished (נָזִיר, from נָזַר, to consecrate), from among his brethren. His glory is like the firstling of his bullock; rather, the firstborn of his oxen, majesty is to him. The singular, שׁור, is here used collectively, as in Deuteronomy 15:19. The oxen are Joseph's sons, all of whom were strong, but the firstborn excelled the rest, and was endowed with majesty. It is Ephraim that is referred to, whom Jacob raised to the position of the firstborn (Genesis 48:8, etc.). His horns are like the horns of unicorns; literally, and horns of a ream are his horns. The ream is supposed to be the aurochs, an animal of the bovine species, allied to the buffalo, now extinct, but which the Assyrian bas-reliefs show to have been formerly hunted in that region (cf. Job 39:9, etc.; Psalm 22:22; Rawlinson 'Anc. Men.,' 1:284). By his strong power, Ephraim should thrust down nations, even the most distant.

Success in enterprise, and felicity at home, are assured to both. \"Although 'going out' (enterprise, labor) is attributed to Zebulun, and 'remaining in tents' (the comfortable enjoyment of life) to Issachar, in accordance with the delineation of their respective characters in the blessing of Jacob, this is to be attributed to the poetic parallelism of the clauses, and the whole is to be understood as applying to both in the sense suggested by Graf, 'Rejoice, Zebulun and Issachar, in your labor and your rest'\" (Keil). They shall call the people unto the mountain; rather, they shall call nations to the mountain, i.e. the mountain of the Lord's inheritance (Exodus 15:17), the place of his sanctuary. Sacrifices of righteousness; i.e. sacrifices offered according to God's Law, and in a manner and a spirit well pleasing to him (Psalm 4:6; 51:21). They shall suck of the abundance of the seas, etc. The treasures of both sea and land should be theirs. The Targumist Jonathan Ben Uzziel explains this as referring especially to the obtaining of the rich purple dye from the shell of the oyster (murex Syrius), and the producing of mirrors and glass vases from the sand. The existence of vitreous sand on the coast of Zebulun is attested both by Strabo (lib. 16. p. 757) and Pliny ('Nat.

Genesis 49:19). He dwelleth as a lion; rather, as a lioness. Though the noun לָבִיא has a masc. termination, usage shows that it was the female and not the male that was thereby designated (see e.g., Genesis 49:9; Numbers 24:9, where it can hardly, be a mere synonym; and Job 4:11; Job 38:39, where the reference to the young of the animal accords better with the lioness than with the lion, Gesenius).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21 refers to Gad's obtaining an inheritance for himself from Moses beyond Jordan. And he provided the first part for himself; literally, and he saw for himself (i.e. chose) the first, i.e. either the most excellent part or the firstfruits of the conquest. Because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; rather, for there the portion of the leader was reserved. The word rendered t, lawgiver,\" or \"leader\" (מְחֹקֵק), signifies primarily one who ordains or appoints, and is used in both the above senses (cf. Exodus 33:22; Judges 5:14); it is here applied to Gad, because that tribe displayed such promptitude and energy at the head of the tribes in the conquest of the land, that it might be regarded as their leader. An entirely different view of the passage has been taken by some, who by the mechokek understand Moses as the lawgiver, and his portion as the place of his grave, which was concealed, but was within the inheritance of Gad. But it is a fatal objection to this view that not only is the word rendered \"portion\" (חֶלְקַת) nowhere used of a grave, but the grave of Moses on Mount Nebo was in the territory of Reuben, not in that of Gad. Gesenius renders, \"The portion of (assigned by) the lawgiver was preserved.\" But this does not tally with the immediately preceding statement, that Gad chose his portion for himself; at any rate, it could not be because of this that he chose it. Gad chose for himself a portion on the east of Jordan, and the portion he had chosen was sacredly kept for him, though he went with his brethren to the conquest of Canaan. And he came with the heads of the people; i.e. his place of marching was with the leaders; his place was at the head of the tribes (cf. Numbers 32:17, 21, 32, and Joshua 1:14; Joshua 4:12). He executed the justice of the Lord, etc.; i.e. he did what God required of him, obeying his commands, and thereby fulfilling all righteousness (cf. Matthew 3:15; Philippians 3:6). With Israel; in the fellowship of Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Jacob compared Dan to a serpent that suddenly springs forth by the way, and bites the heels of a horse so that the rider falls backward. Moses here compares the tribe to a young lion that suddenly leaps from its lair in Bashan on the object of its attack. Both similitudes relate to the vigor and force which the tribe should display in conflict.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - In Jacob's blessing, Naphtali appears invested with the attributes of freedom, gracefulness, and graciousness; here Moses assures that tribe of the Divine grace and blessing, and promises to it prosperity and felicity. Possess thou the west and the south. The word rendered \"west\" here (ָֻם) properly means sea, and came to signify \"west\" from the fact of the Mediterranean, or Great Sea, lying to the west of Palestine. The proper meaning of the word is to be retained here. As the territory of Naphtali lay in the north of Canaan, and was far from the sea, the blessing here pronounced upon him must be understood generally of prosperity and felicity. He was to possess riches as of the sea, and genial and fructifying warmth as of the south.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 24, 25. - Asher, the prosperous one, as his name implies, was to be rich, and honored, and strong, and peaceful. Blessed with children; rather, blessed among the sons; i.e. either blessed more than the rest of the sons, or blessed by the sons who were to reap benefit from him. From what follows, the latter explanation seems the one to be preferred. The preposition מִן is constantly used as indicating the source whence anything proceeds, or the agent by whom anything is done. Let him be acceptable to his brethren; \"iis e tetras suae proventibus res optimas suppeditaturus; cf. Genesis 49:20\" (Rosenmüller). This tribe should find itself in so advantageous and luxurious a condition that the ether tribes should have delight and pleasure in it\" (Knobel). Others render, \"favored among his brethren;\" favored, that is, by the Lord more than his brethren (Keil). But the former seems preferable. And let him dip his foot in oil. This points to a land abounding in olives, and generally richly fertile, a fat land and yielding rich dainties, such as Jacob promised to Asher (Genesis 49:20). Thy shoes shall be iron and brass. The word rendered \"shoes\" (מִנְעָל) occurs only here. It is a derivative from נָעַל, to bolt or shut fast, and is to be taken in the sense of a fastness or fortress, a place securely closed: iron and brass shall be thy fortress; i.e. his dwelling should be strong and impregnable. The rendering\" shoes\" is from a supposed derivation of the word from נַעַל, a shoe. As thy days, so shall thy strength be; literally, as thy days, thy rest; i.e. as long as thou livest, so long shalt thou have rest and quiet. The noun rendered \"strength\" (דֹבֵא) in the Authorized Version. occurs only here, unless it be found in the proper name מֶידְבָא (Me-deba), and has no Cognate in Hebrew; but the Arabic supplies a root for it in (deba), to rest. Furst connects it with זָב, and the Targum with דְּוָא, to flow, and translates by \"riches.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-29. - As Moses commenced by celebrating the glorious majesty of Jehovah when he appeared to establish his covenant with Israel, so he concludes with a reference to God as the eternal Refuge and the saving Help of his people. Verse 26. - There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun. The points and accents direct that this should be read, There is none like God, O Jeshurun; and though all the ancient versions read as does the Authorized Version, the Masoretic punctuation is vindicated here by the following thy help, which shows that Israel is here addressed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy33:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - God is the Refuge or Dwelling-place of his people, their Protection amid the storms of life, and the unfailing Source of comfort and blessing to them in their pilgrimage state.

Israel is to be congratulated and praised because, through the true God, it has unparalleled protection, salvation, and triumph\" (Herxheimer). Thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; literally, shall feign unto thee; i.e. shall pretend to be thy friends, in order to obtain favor with thee. The verb conveys the idea of fawning upon a person with a feigned humility and submissiveness (cf. Psalm 18:44; Psalm 66:2; Psalm 81:15). Thou shalt tread upon their high places; i.e. shalt wholly subdue them and triumph over them (cf. Deuteronomy 32:13); \"crees eorum in montibus positas, loca eorum inaccessa victor calcabis, its potieris; qua ipsa phrasi Amos 4:13, Micah 1:3, superbe incedens victor describitur\" (Rosenmüller).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Deut.34":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy34:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.

The rabbins say that Moses was buried by retiring into a cavern, where he died and where his body remained. It is probable that, like Enoch and Elijah, he was transferred to the invisible world without seeing corruption. Hence his appearance along with Elijah in bodily form on the Mount of the Transfiguration; and hence also, perhaps, the tradition of the contest for the body of Moses between Michael and Satan (Jude 1:9). If the body of Moses was actually buried, the concealment of his grave so that no man knew of it may be justly regarded as \"the first instance on record of the providential obliteration, so remarkably exemplified afterwards in the gospel history, of the ' holy places' of Palestine; the providential safeguard against their elevation to a sanctity which might endanger the real holiness of the history and religion which they served to commemorate\" (Stanley). The reverence which the Jews paid to graves shows that there was no small danger of their coming under a superstitious regard to that of Moses had it been known.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy34:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Though Moses had reached the age of a hundred and twenty years, his eye had not become dim, nor were the juices of his body dried.

The statement in this verse could only have been inserted some time after the death of Moses, and after the people had had manifestations of God's presence with them, both by communications from him through the prophets and by the successes which he had given them over their enemies. But it is not necessary to suppose that a long period during which a lengthened succession of prophets had arisen had elapsed. \"Moses was the founder and mediator of the old covenant. As long as this covenant was to last, no prophet could arise in Israel like unto Moses.

The Amorites had wrested from Moab a portion of the territory taken by the Moabites and the Edomites from the giant aborigines; and Og, who was of the same giant race, ruled over the northern half of the region of Gilead and over all Bashan. This district also God purposed Israel to possess; and therefore, before crossing the Jordan, a diversion was made north. wards by the Israelites, for the purpose of attacking this powerful chief. Og encountered them with all his host, but was signally defeated, and he and all his people were exterminated. Not fewer than three score fortified cities, besides villages, were captured by the Israelites, the whole country was subjugated, and all the cattle and material property taken as booty (cf. Numbers 21:33-35). Verse 1. - (Cf. Numbers 21:33 ) We turned - i.e. took a new route - and went up (וַנַּעַל, and we ascended).

The region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. The region of Argob comprised the kingdom of Og, and Bashan was another name for the same country; extending from the Jabbok to Hermon, and embracing both the northern part of Gilead, and what was afterwards in a stricter sense Bashan, viz. the land north of the Wady Zerka (hod. Jebel Ajlan) to Hermon. The name Argob is supposed by some to be given to the district from a town of that name, fifteen Roman miles eastward from Gerasa, a city of Arabia (Eusebius); but more probably it is derived from the character of the district, either as deep-soiled (from רֶגֶב, a clod), or as rugged and uneven (רְגוב, from רָגַב akin to רָגָם, to heap up), just as the neighboring district to the east and northeast received the name Traohonitis (from τραχών, rough, rugged); in the Targum, indeed, Trachona (טרכונא) is the name given here for Argob. This district is now known as the province of El-Lejah (The Retreat). It is described as oval in form, about twenty-two miles long by fourteen wide; a plateau elevated about thirty feet above the surrounding plain. Its features are most remarkable. It is composed of a thick stratum of black basalt, which seems to have been emitted in a liquid state from pores in the earth, and to have flowed out on all sides till the whole surface was covered. It is rent and shattered as if by internal convulsion. The cup-like cavities from which the liquid mass was projected are still seen, and also the wavy surface such as a thick liquid generally assumes which cools as it is flowing. There are deep fissures and yawning gulfs with rugged, broken edges; and there are jagged mounds that seem not to have been sufficiently heated to flow, but which were forced up by some mighty agency, and then rent and shattered to their centers. The rock is filled with air-bubbles, and is almost as hard as iron. (Dr. Porter, in Kitto, 'Biblical Cyclopaedia,' 3:1032; see also the same author's 'Five Years in Damascus,' 2:240, etc.; and 'The Giant Cities of Bashan'; Burckhardt, 'Travels in Syria,' p. 110, etc.; Wetstein, 'Reisebericht fib.

These cities, with their marvelous erections, are believed to be still existing in the Hauran. Over that district tire strewn a multitude of towns of various sizes, all constructed after the same remarkable fashion. \"The streets are perfect, the walls perfect, and, what seems more astonish. tug, the stone doors are still hanging on their hinges, so little impression has been made during these many centuries on the hard and durable stone of which they are built\" (Graham, Cambridge Essays, p. 160). These doors are \"formed of slabs of stone, opening on pivots which are projecting parts of the stone itself, and working in sockets in the lintel and threshold.\" Some of these gates are large enough to admit of a camel passing through them, and the doors are of proportionate dimensions, some of the stones of which they are formed being eighteen inches in thickness. The roofs also are formed of huge stone slabs resting on the massive walls. All betoken the workmanship of a race endowed with powers far exceeding those of ordinary men; and give credibility to the supposition that we have in them the dwellings of the giant race that occupied that district before it was invaded by the Israelites. \"We could not help,\" says Mr. Graham, \"being impressed with the belief that had we never known anything of the early portion of Scripture history before visiting this country, we should have been forced to the conclusion that its original inhabitants, the people who had constructed those cities, were not only a powerful and mighty nation, but individuals of greater strength than ourselves.\" Ver. 6. - (See Deuteronomy 2:34.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Hermon (חֶרְמון), probably from חָרַם, to be high, \"the lofty peak,\" conspicuous on all sides. By some the name is supposed to be connected with חֶרֶם, a devoted thing, because this mountain marked the limit of the country devoted or placed under a ban; and it is certainly remarkable that, at the extreme north-east and the extreme southwest of the laud conquered by the Israelites, names derived from Hereto, viz. Hermon and Hormah (Deuteronomy 1:44), should be found; as if to indicate that all between was devoted. Hermon is the southernmost spur of the Autilibanus range. It is \"the second mountain in Syria, ranking next to the highest peak of Lebanon behind the cedars. The elevation of Hermon may be estimated at about 10,000 feet. The whole body of the mountain is limestone, similar to that which composes the main ridge of Lebanon, the central peak rises up an obtuse truncated cone, from 2000 to 3000 feet above the ridges that radiate from it, thus giving it a more commanding aspect than any other mountain in Syria. This cone is entirely naked, destitute alike of trees and vegetation. The snow never disappears from its summit\" (Porter, 'Handbook, Syria and Palestine,' p. 431). At the present day it is known as Jebel esh-Sheikh (The Chief Mountain), also Jebel eth Thel (The Snow Mountain). Anciently also it had various names. By the Hebrews it was known also as Sion (שִׂיאֹן, the high, Deuteronomy 4:48); by the Sidonians it was called Sirion (שִׂרְיון = שִׁרְיון, a cuirass or coat of mail), probably from its shining appearance, especially when covered with snow and by the Amorites it was called Senir, a word probably of the same meaning. These names continued in use to a late period (cf.

This measured nine cubits in length, and four in breadth, \"after the cubit of a man,\" i.e. according to the cubit in common use. Taking the cubit as equal to eighteen inches, the measure of the bedstead would be thirteen feet and a half by six feet. That Og even approximated to this height is incredible; if he reached nine or ten feet his height would exceed that of any one on record. It is probable, however, that he may have had his bed made vastly larger than himself, partly from ostentation, partly that he might leave a memorial that should impress upon posterity a sense of his gigantic size and resistless might; just as Alexander the Great is said (Died. Sic., 17:95) to have, on his march to India, caused couches to be made for his soldiers in their tents, each five cubits long, in order to impress the natives with an overwhelming sense of the greatness of his host. It has been suggested that it is not a bed that is here referred to, but a sarcophagus of basalt or ironstone in which, it is supposed, the corpse of Og was placed, and which was afterwards carried to Rabbath, and there deposited (J. D. Michaelis, Winer, Knobel, etc.). This implies that the passage is a later insertion, and not part of the original narrative as given by Moses. But with what view could such an insertion be introduced? Not to establish the credibility of the story of the victory of the Israelites over Og, for the existence of a sarcophagus in which a corpse had been placed would only attest the fact that such a one once lived and died, but would prove nothing as to how or when or where he came by his death. Not to show the vast size of the man, for a sarcophagus affords no measure whatever of the size of the person whose remains are placed in it, being an honorary monument, the size of which is proportioned to the real or supposed dignity of the person for whose honor it is made. A bed, on the contrary, which a man had used, or at least had caused to be made for himself, would afford some evidence of his size; and there is an obvious reason for Moses referring to this here, inasmuch as thereby he recalled-to the Israelites the remembrance, on the one hand, of what occasioned the fear with which they anticipated the approach of this terrible foe, and, on the other, of the grace of God to them in that he had delivered Og and all his people into their hand. It is idle to inquire how Moses could know of the existence of this bed at Rabbath; for we may be well assured that from all the peoples through whose territories he had passed reports of the strength and prowess and doings of this giant warrior would be poured into his ear.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-17. - Distribution of the conquered land. The countries thus conquered by the Israelites were assigned by Moses to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh. The southern portion, from Aroer, in the valley of the Amen, to the Jabbok, with its towns (see Joshua 12:15-20, 24-28), was assigned to the Reubenites and the Gadites; and the northern portion, from the Jabbok, comprehending, with Gilead, the whole of Bashan, or Argob, to the half tribe of Manasseh.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The last part of this verse is differently construed and rendered by different translators. By some the clause all the region of Argob is connected with what precedes, while others regard this clause as in apposition with what follows. Targum: \"All the region of Trachona, and all that province was called the land of giants;\" LXX. \"And all the region of Argob, all that Bashan: the land of the Rephaim it was reckoned:\" Vulgate: \"The whole region of Argob, and all Bashan is called the land of giants.\" Modern interpreters for the most part adopt the order of the Targum. The clause may be rendered thus: The whole region of Argob as respects all Bashan [i.e. in so far as it formed part of the kingdom of Bashan under Og] was reputed the land of the Rephaim.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTJair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Jair, a descendant of Manasseh by the mother's side (his father was of the tribe of Judah, 1 Chronicles 2:22), obtained the Argob region unto - i.e., inclusive of (see Joshua 13:13) - the territory of the Geshuri and Maachathi. These were small Syrian tribes located to the east of Hermon. As Geshur signifies a bridge, it has been conjectured that the Geshurites were located near some well-known bridge across the Jordan, of which, perhaps, they were the keepers, and from this took their name. Maachah is called Aram (Syria) Maachah in 1 Chronicles 19:6. According to the 'Ono-masticon,' it was \"a city of the Amorites, by the Jordan, near Mount Hermon\" (s.v. Μαχαθί). It had in later times a king, who allied himself with the Ammonites against David (1 Chronicles 19:7). These tribes were subdued, but not destroyed, by the Israelites; and at a later period seem to have regained their independence, and to have formed one kingdom (comp. 2 Samuel 3:3; 2 Samuel 10:6; 2 Samuel 13:37; 2 Samuel 15:8; 1 Chronicles 3:2). And called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair. The word havoth (properly chavvoth, חַלֺוּת) is the plural of a word meaning life, and Char-voth-Jair probably signifies Jair's livings, not Jair's villages, for these were apparently fortified cities (vers. 4, 5; Joshua 13:30; 1 Kings 4:13). These were recaptured by the Geshurites, aided by the Arameans (1 Chronicles 2:23, \"And Geshur and Aram took Chavvoth-Jair from them,\" etc.); at what time is unknown. From Numbers 32:42, it appears that Nobah, also a family descended from Machir, took certain towns, viz. \"Kenath and her daughters\" in this district; these, with the twenty-three Hay-voth-Jair, made up the sixty towns which \"belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead\" (1 Chronicles 2:23). Nobah was probably in some way subordinate to Jair, and so in this rhetorical discourse, where it is not the purpose of the author to enter on minute details, the whole of these cities are included under the name Havvoth-Jair. Unto this day. \"This does not necessarily imply a long time; and Moses himself may have used this expression, though only shortly after the event, in order to give prominence to the capture of the fortified cities of the giant' king Og, by the Manassites for the encouragement of the Israelites\" (Herzheimer).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I gave Gilead unto Machir.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Cf.

Its southern boundary was the middle of the valley (the wady) of the Arnon; half the valley, and the border, i.e. the middle of the ravine (or wady) and its edge; a more precise definition of the river Arnon; the brook which flowed through the middle of the ravine was to be their boundary line to the south. On the northeast the Upper Jabbok (Nahr Amman) was to be their boundary; this separated them from Ammonitis, the region of the children of Ammon (Numbers 21:24). On the west the 'Arabah (Ghor), and the Jordan and its border (its east bank), from Chinnereth (Kinnereth), a fenced city by the sea of Galilee, thence called \"the sea of Chinnereth\" (Numbers 34:11; Joshua 12:3; Joshua 19:35), to the sea of the 'Arabah, the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah - the slopes (literally, the outpourings, the place where the mountain torrents flow out, hence the base of the hill) of Pisgah (Numbers 21:15; Numbers 27:12) - eastward; i.e. simply the east side of the 'Arabah and the Jordan.

Verse 21. - At that time, i.e. after the conquest of the land on the east of the Jordan (see Numbers 27:12, etc.). Thine eyes have seen, etc. Joshua was directed to what he had himself witnessed, what his own eyes had seen, in the destruction of Sihon and Og and their hosts, that he might be encouraged to go forward in the course to which he had been called; and the people are reminded of this, that they may keep in mind what God had done for Israel, and may without fear follow Joshua as their leader to the conquest of Canaan (comp. Deuteronomy 31:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - The \"he\" here is emphatic; as God himself would fight for them, why should they be afraid?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I besought the LORD at that time, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 23-29. - Prayer of Moses. Moses knew that he was not to enter the Promised Land with the people; but, reluctant to relinquish the enterprise which he had so far conducted until he should see it successfully finished, he besought the Lord that at least he might be permitted to cross the Jordan, and see the goodly land. This prayer was presented probably just before Moses asked God to set a man over the congregation to be their leader to the promised land (Numbers 27:15-17); for the command to give a charge to Joshua, in that office, follows immediately, as part of God's answer to Moses' request (ver. 28), and the expression \"at that time\" (ver. 23) points back to the charge of Moses to Joshua, as contemporaneous with the offering of his prayer. In this prayer Moses appeals to what he had already experienced of God's favor to him, in that he had begun to show him his greatness and his mighty power. The reference is to the victories already achieved over the Amorites; these were tokens of the Divine power graciously manifested to Israel, and Moses appeals to them as strengthening his plea for further favors (comp. the pleading, Exodus 33:12, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - O Lord God: O Lord Jehovah.

This was \"goodly,\" especially in contrast with the arid and sunburnt desert through which the Israelites had passed; the hills gave promise of streams that should cool the air and refresh and fertilize the land (see Deuteronomy 8:7, etc.). Moses longed to go over if but to see this land, and to plant his foot on it; but his request was not granted.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy3:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - The Lord was wroth, etc. (cf. Deuteronomy 1:37; Numbers 20:12; Numbers 27:13, 14). Let it suffice thee; literally, Enough for thee! i.e. either Thou hast said enough; say no more, or Be content; let what I have done, and the grace I have given, be enough for thee (comp. the use of this formula in Genesis 45:28; Numbers 16:3; Deuteronomy 1:6; Deuteronomy 2:3).

Moses, having presented to the people certain facts in their recent history which had in them a specially animating and encouraging tendency, proceeds to direct his discourse to the inculcation of duties and exhortations to obedience to the Divine enactments. This portion also of his address is of an introductory character as well as what precedes. Verses 1-8. - Exhortation to the observance of the Law generally. The Law was to be kept as a complete whole; nothing was to be taken from it or added to it; it comprised the commandments of Jehovah, and therefore they were not only to do it as what Moses, their leader and lawgiver, had enjoined, but to keep it as a sacred deposit, not to be altered or tampered with, and to observe it as what God their Sovereign had enacted for them. The dignity and worth of the Law are here asserted, and also its completeness as given by Moses. Any addition to it, no less than any subtraction from it, would mar its integrity and affect its perfection. Altered circumstances in process of time might, indeed, lead to the desuetude of some parts of the Mosaic enactments, and new institutions or laws might be required to meet a new condition of things, or even in that new condition to fence and sustain the primitive code; but that cede was to remain intact in the Statute-Book, and no alterations were to be made upon it that should affect its substance or nullify any of its principles. New laws and institutions appointed by God would, of course, have the same authority as those originally ordained by Moses; and such, it can hardly be doubted, were in point of fact under the Hebrew monarchy introduced by the prophets speaking in the name of God. The Law, nevertheless, was kept substantially entire. Even under the new dispensation, the Law has not been abolished. Christ, as he himself declared, came not to destroy the Law and the prophets, but to fulfill them (Matthew 5:17). The sin of the Pharisees, for which they were censured by our Lord, lay in this, that they taught for doctrines the commandments of men (Matthew 15:9), and had \"made the commandments of God of none effect by their traditions\" (Matthew 15:6). Verses 1, 2. - Now therefore; rather And now. With this Moses passes from referring to what God had done for Israel to admonish Israel as to what they had to do as the subjects of God and the recipients of his favor. They were to give heed to all the statutes and judgments which Moses, as the servant of God, had taught them, in order that they might do them. Statutes (חֻקִּים), the things prescribed or enacted by law, whether moral, ritual, or civil; judgments (מִשְׁפָטִים), rights, whether public or private, all that each could claim as his due, and all he was bound to render to God or to his fellow-men as their due. These two comprehend the whole Law as binding on Israel. On the doing of these by the people depended life; these had been made known to them, not merely for their information, but specifically that they might do them, and thereby have life; not long life in the Promised Land alone, though this also is included (ver. 40; Deuteronomy 5:33; Deuteronomy 6:2, etc.), but that higher life, that life which man lives \"by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 8:3; cf. Leviticus 18:5; Ezekiel 20:11; Matthew 4:4), that spiritual life which is in God's favor (Psalm 30:5). Enjoying this life as the fruit of obedience, they should also possess as their inheritance the laud promised to their fathers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYour eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - The people had had personal experience of the danger, on the one hand, of transgressing, and the benefit, on the other, of keeping God's Law; they had seen how those who sinned in worshipping Baal-peer were destroyed (Numbers 25:3, 9), whilst those who remained faithful to the Lord were kept alive. This experience the people had had only lately before, so that a reference to it would be all the more impressive. Baal-peor, the idol whose cultus was observed at Peor. Baal (Bal, Be cf., Bel, Lord) was the common name of the supreme deity among the northern of the Semitic-speaking people, the Canaanites, the Phoenicians, the Aramaeans, and the Assyrians. There were thus many Baals. Followed: walked after; a common Biblical expression for religious adherence and service (cf. Jeremiah 8:2; Jeremiah 9:14; and with a different formula, Numbers 32:12; Deuteronomy 1:36; Joshua 14:8; Judges 2:12, etc.). Ye that did cleave unto Jehovah your God. \"To cleave unto one\" is expressive of the closest, most intimate attachment and communion (cf. Genesis 2:24; Isaiah 14:1). The phrase is frequently used of devotion to the service and worship of the true God (cf. Deuteronomy 10:20; Joshua 22:5; Joshua 23:8; Acts 2:23, etc.); here it expresses the contrast between the conduct of those who remained faithful to Jehovah and those who forsook him to worship Baal. Are alive every one of you this day. \"Thus they that keep themselves pure in general defections, are saved from the common destruction (Ezekiel 9:4-6; 2 Timothy 2:19; Revelation 20:4)\" (Ainsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5, 6. - The institutes of Moses were the commandments of Jehovah, and therefore obedience to them was imperative. By this was conditioned the enjoyment by Israel of the Promised Land; and this would be their wisdom and understanding in the sight of the nations; to themselves it would be life, and to the nations it would convey an impression of their being the depositories of true wisdom and knowledge, so that they should be constrained to say, Surely a wise and understanding people is this great nation. \"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that is wise winneth souls\" (Proverbs 11:30). God's statutes make wise the simple (Psalm 19:8; Psalm 119:98, 99); and they who are thus made wise attract the attention of others by the fame of their wisdom. Thus the Queen of Sheba heard in her distant country of the wisdom of Solomon, and came to him to commune with him of all that was in her heart (1 Kings 10:1, etc.); and many throughout the ages who were seeking after truth among the heathen, were drawn to Israel by seeing how with them was the true knowledge of God. Israel was thus exalted because God was nigh to them, ready to hear their cry and to give them what they needed; which none of the gods of the nations were or could be to their votaries; and because, in the Law which God had given them, they had such instruction and direction as no heathen nation possessed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7, 8. - Translate, For what great nation is there that hath gods that draft near to it, as Jehovah our God whenever we call upon him?

Deuteronomy 33:29; Psalm 34:17-20; Psalm 145:18; 1 Samuel 14:36; 1 Kings 18:26-29, 37; James 4:8). \"True right has its roots in God; and with the obscuration of the knowledge of God, law and right, with their divinely established foundations, are also shaken and obscured (cf. Romans 1:26-32)\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOnly take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-14. - The possession of the oracles of God by Israel was a benefit to them only as these were kept in mind and reverently obeyed. Therefore they were to take heed and diligently beware of forgetting the circumstances under which the Law had been received at Horeb. God had then commanded the people to be gathered together, so that they stood before the Lord, were in his manifested presence, and were made to hear his voice speaking to them from amidst the fire and the clouds that covered the mount. They had thus actual evidence and guarantee that the Law they had received was Divine; and this they were to keep in mind as long as they lived, and to communicate to their children in all coming time, that so they might fear the Lord; for on this rested that covenant which God had made with Israel, and which they were to keep as the condition of their continuing to enjoy privilege and life. Verse 9. - Keep thy soul diligently; i.e. Be very careful to preserve thy life (cf. Job 2:6; Proverbs 13:3; Proverbs 16:17; Proverbs 19:16; in all which passages the same formula is used as here). The Hebrew (נֶפֻשׁ) means primarily breath, then vital principle, natural life (anima), then soul life, the soul or mind (animus). The forgetting of the wonders they had seen would lead to their forgetting God, and so to their departing from him, and this would mar and ultimately destroy their life (cf. Joshua 23:11-16).

The word \"specially,\" introduced by the translators into the Authorized Version, is a needless interpolation. With this verse begins a new sentence, which is continued in ver. 11 on to the end of ver. 13.

With darkness, clouds [cloud], and thick darkness; underneath the fire was a cloud of deep darkness, out of which it blazed, the \"thick cloud\" of Exodus 19:9, 16, and the \"smoke\" out of which the lightnings flashed, and over which the glory of the Lord, like devouring fire, rested on the top of the mountain (Exodus 19:18; Exodus 20:18; Exodus 24:16, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - On this occasion the people heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; there was no form or shape apparent to the eye. No man can see God's face (Exodus 33:20, 23); \"no man hath seen God at any time\" (John 1:18); and though the nobles or elders of Israel who went up with Moses into the mount are said to have seen God, it is evident that what they saw was only some luminous manifestation of his glory, and not a form or shape of which a similitude could be made (Exodus 24:9-17). Even Moses, with whom God said that he would speak mouth to month, and who should behold the similitude of God (Numbers 12:8), was told that he could not see his face, his essential personality, but only his back, the reflection of his glory (Exodus 33:18-23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - His covenant; God's gracious engagement with Israel for their good, and by which they were bound to observe all his commandments. God declared this at Sinai when he uttered the ten commandments (words, דְבָרִים), \"the words of the covenant, the ten words\" (Exodus 34:28), which he afterwards gave to Moses on two tables of stone, written with the finger of God (Exodus 24:12; Exodus 31:18). Besides these, there were other statutes and ordinances which Moses was commanded to teach the people, and which, with them, comprised the Law given at Sinai (see Exodus 21. and following chapters).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-20. - As the people had seen no form or figure when God spake to them, so they were to beware for their very lives (cf. ver. 9) of acting corruptly by making any kind of image, whether of man or of beast, for the purpose of worshipping God as represented by it; they were also to beware of being so attracted by the splendor of the heavenly bodies as to be forcibly seduced to worship them and offer them religious service. They were not in this respect to imitate the heathen; for God, who had delivered them out of the furnace of Egyptian bondage, had taken them for himself to be his special possession; and therefore they were to take heed not to forget the covenant of Jehovah their God, nor to offend him by making any image or representation of him as the object of worship. Among the heathen, and especially in Egypt, images were the very pillar and support of religion; but in Israel, as God had revealed himself to them without form, it was as a spirit he was to be worshipped, and not under any outward representation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Graven image (פֶסֶל), carved work or sculpture, whether of wood, or metal, or stone - the similitude of any figure - the form of any idol (סֶמֶל, form, statue, idol) - the likeness - figure (תַבְנִית, a building, a model, a form, or figure) - of male or female - in apposition to graven image, and illustrative of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - The likeness - the figure - of any beast, etc. A warning against the animal-worship of Egypt.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, etc. The worship of the heavenly bodies, especially star-worship, prevailed among the Canaanites and many of the Semitic tribes, but was not confined to them; the Egyptians also reverenced the sun as Re, the moon as Isis, and the stars as the symbols of deities. The Israelites were thus, both from past associations and from what they might encounter in Canaan, exposed to the danger of being seduced into idolatry. Shouldest be driven: shouldest be urged on, drawn, or constrained (cf. Deuteronomy 13:13). Which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven, God had allotted (חָלַק) to all mankind the heavenly bodies for their advantage (Genesis 1:14-18; Psalm 104:19; Jeremiah 31:35); it was, therefore, not competent for any one nation to seek to appropriate them as specially theirs, and it was absurd for any to offer religious service to objects intended for the service of man. Targum: Which the Lord thy God prepared for all peoples under heaven; Vulgate: Quae creavit Dominus Deus tuus in ministerium cunctis gentibus. This seems better than the interpretation that God had \"allotted them for worship, i.e. had permitted them [the nations] to choose them as the objects of their worship\" (Keil, etc.); for:NEWLINENEWLINE1. There is no distinction here between the Hebrews and the other nations of the earth; \"all nations\" includes them as well as the heathen.NEWLINENEWLINE2. Though God permitted the heathen to worship the heavenly bodies, he never allotted these to men in order that they might worship them. \"It noteth God's bounty in giving all people the use of those creatures, and the base mind of man to worship such things as are given for servants unto men\" (Ainsworth).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Iron furnace - furnace for smelting iron: \"figure of burning torment in Egypt\" (Herxheimer). This reference to the smelting of iron shows that, though the implements of the ancient Egyptians were mostly of copper, iron must also have been in extensive use among them. Other references to the use of iron are to be found in the Pentateuch; see Genesis 4:22; Leviticus 26:19; Numbers 35:16; Deuteronomy 3:11; Deuteronomy 8:9; Deuteronomy 19:5; Deuteronomy 27:5 (Goguet, 'Origine des Lois,' 1:172; Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egypt,' 1:169; 2:155).

Verse 21. - The Lord was angry with me... and swore, etc. Neither in Numbers 20:12, nor in Numbers 27:12-14, is there any mention of God's having sworn that Moses should not enter Canaan with the people; but it is absurd to suppose, as some have done, that the writer here has confounded this with what is recorded in Numbers 14:21, 28, - that is inconceivable; and it certainly does not follow, because no mention is made in Numbers of God's having sworn, that he did not swear on this occasion; if he confirmed with an oath his decree that the generation that rebelled at Kadesh should not enter Canaan, the probability surely is that he would do the same when he announced to Moses the decree that he should not conduct Israel into the promised laud. \"It is perfectly obvious, from Deuteronomy 3:23, sqq., that all the details are not given in the historical account of the event referred \"(Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - A graven image, or the likeness of any thing, etc. - literally, a graven (sculptured) image of a form of all that Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee; s.c. not to make (cf. Deuteronomy 16-18 and Deuteronomy 2:37).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - A consuming fire. When God spoke to Israel at Sinai, his glory appeared \"like devouring (consuming) fire on the top of the mount\" (Exodus 24:17); and in allusion to this Moses here calls God \"a consuming fire.\" He is so to all his enemies, and to all who disobey him; by severe inflictions he will punish, and, if they persist in their hostility and rebellion, will ultimately destroy them (comp. Deuteronomy 9:3; Isaiah 10:16-18; Amos 5:6; Zephaniah 1:18; Hebrews 12:29). A jealous God; LXX., Θεὸς ζηλωτής God has a burning zeal for his own glory; he guards it with jealous care; and he will not spare those who do him dishonor, especially those who are guilty of idolatry, whereby they \"change the truth of God into a lie\" (Romans 1:25; cf. Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 6:14, 15; Deuteronomy 32:16, etc.; Psalm 78:58, etc.; Nahum 1:2). He is jealous also over his people, because he loves them, and will not endure any rival in their affection and devotion.NEWLINENEWLINECHAPTER 4:25-49NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 25-31. - Moses enforces the warning against idolatry, by predicting the evil that should come upon the nation through the apostasy of those who should in after times turn from Jehovah to strange gods. When they should have begotten children and children's children, and had been long in the land, i.e. when in after years a generation should arise that had not known the things they had seen, or had forgotten them (ver. 9), and the nation should then become wanton and corrupt, and fall into idolatry (cf. Deuteronomy 6:10, etc.; Deuteronomy 8:7, etc.; Deuteronomy 31:20, 21; 32:15, etc.; Hosea 13:6); then should they utterly perish from off the land of which they were now about to take possession. Verse 25. - Have remained long in the land; literally, have become old, an ancient nation, etc. To provoke him to anger; i.e. so as that he should be displeased and grieved, and roused to punish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - I call heaven and earth to witness. Moses speaks in the name of the Lord of all, and so calls to witness the whole created universe to attest his words; the heavens and earth are witnesses for God, and when evil comes on those who transgress his Law, they declare his righteousness (Psalm 50:4, 6), in that what has befallen the sinner is only what was announced beforehand as the penalty of transgression. Soon; hastily (מַהֵר), without delay (cf. Deuteronomy 7:4, 22 [\"at once,\" Authorized Vers.]; 9:3 [\"quickly\"], 12, 16). Prolong days; usually equal to have a long life (cf. Deuteronomy 5:16; Deuteronomy 6:2; Deuteronomy 11:9; Deuteronomy 17:20, etc.); here it means \"continue long to occupy.\" Only as they continued faithful to Jehovah could they continue as a people to possess the land; severed from him, they lost their title to occupy Canaan, and ceased to be his special people; as a nation they would be destroyed by being scattered among other nations. From Leviticus 26:33, etc., and Deuteronomy 28:64, it is evident that the author had in view \"all the dispersions which would come upon the rebellious nation in future times, even down to the dispersion under the Romans, which continues still; so that Moses contemplated the punishment in its fullest extent\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - Few in number; literally, men of number, i.e. that may be counted; few as compared with the heathen among whom they should be dispersed (Genesis 34:30). Shall lead you. The verb here (נִהֵג, Piel of נָהַג) is frequently used in the sense of conducting gently and kindly (Isaiah 49:10; Isaiah 63:14; Psalm 48:14; Psalm 78:52); but it also means to drive, to carry off, to convey forcibly (Exodus 14:25; Genesis 31:26; Exodus 10:13; Psalm 78:26); the connection shows that it is in the latter sense it is to be taken here. Dispersed among the heathen, they, who had dishonored God by making an image to represent him, should be compelled to do service to mere dead idols, the work of men's hands, which not only could not hear or see, as God can, but also could not-perform even such animal functions as eating and smelling (Psalm 115:4-7; Jeremiah 10:3-9). These idols are called \"gods\" by Moses, because they were so counted by those who worshipped them; elsewhere he stigmatizes them as \"abominations,\" things to be loathed and abhorred (שִׁקּוּצִים, Deuteronomy 27:15; Deuteronomy 29:17). As had been their sin, so should be their punishment; as they had dishonored God, so should they be themselves dishonored; as they had worshipped by an image him who is spirit and without form, they should be made to sink down to an utterly materialized worship, that of mere idols, the work of men's hands; as they had apostatized from the one holy and true God, they should be degraded to become the servants of abominations, objects of loathing and abhorrence (Jeremiah 16:13; Acts 7:42). God, however, would not utterly cast them off: if, in their misery and degradation, they should repent and turn again to him and seek him sincerely and earnestly, they should find him; for he is a merciful God, and mindful of the covenant which he swam unto their fathers (cf. Leviticus 26:39, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 29. - With all thy heart and with all thy soul. As true religion consists in loving the Lord with all the heart and soul, the whole inner nature (Deuteronomy 6:5; Deuteronomy 10:12), so true repentance consists in a turning from sin and all ungodliness to God, in a coming from a state of enmity to him, or of indifference to his claims, to honor, reverence, and serve him intelligently and sincerely, thinking of him aright, adoring his perfections, delighting in him u the alone good, giving to him that honor which is his due, and doing his will from the heart (cf. 2 Chronicles 15:15). When men have apostatized from God, it is often by means of \"tribulation\" that they are brought to a right state of mind towards him, and to a true repentance \"not to be repented of;\" and to effect this is the design of all the chastisements which God sends on his own people (Hebrews 12:5-11; cf. Jeremiah 24:7; Jeremiah 29:10-13; L 4, etc.; Ezekiel 6:11, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 30. - In the latter days; in the afterward of days (בְּאַחֲריִת הַיָּמִים; \"end,\" Deuteronomy 11:12)-a phase used sometimes to designate the times of the Messiah (Isaiah 2:2; Hosea 3:5; comp. Acts 2:17; 1 Peter 1:20; Hebrews 1:1; 1 John 2:18); but here, as generally, it simply indicates futurity, the time to come (cf. Genesis 49:1; Numbers 24:14; Deuteronomy 31:29, etc.). This, however, may include the far distant future, and so points to the time when Israel shall finally return to the Lord and be saved, through the acknowledgment of him whom they despised and rejected when he came as the Messiah promised to the fathers. As St. Paul grounds the assurance of the final redemption of Israel, as a whole, on their calling of God (Romans 11:26-29), so Moses here sees in God's covenant the ground of the ever-watchful care and grace of God to Israel, and the security of their final restoration as a nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 31. - Will not forsake thee; literally, will not let thee loose, will not lose hold of thee, will not cast thee off (cf. Romans 11:1, etc.). \"Israel will return and find God, because he loses not hold of it\" (Herxheimer). \"The sinner will incline to seek God only when he apprehends him as gracious and ready to hear\" (Calvin).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32-40. - Still more to enforce his warning against apostasy, and urge to obedience and faithful adherence to the service of Jehovah, Moses appeals to what they had already experienced of God's grace in the choosing of them to be his people, in his speaking to them to instruct them, and in the miracles which he had wrought for their deliverance and guidance; grace such as had never been showed before to any nation, or heard of since the creation of the world, and by which those who had experienced it were laid under the deepest obligations of gratitude and duty, to love and serve him by whom it had been showed. With this appeal he closes his first address. Verse 32. - For. This connects the statement that fellows with that which precedes as its cause; it is because Jehovah is a merciful God, that the unparalleled grace showed to Israel had been displayed. The days that are past, etc., i.e. inquire from the earliest time of man's abode on the earth. From the one side of heaven unto the other; search the records of all times and places, whether any so great a thing has ever happened or been heard of.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:33VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDid ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 33. - (Cf. ver.

By temptations (מַסּות, plu. of מַסָּה, a testing, a trial) - i.e. by the plagues inflicted on Pharaoh and his people, whereby they were tested and tried - by signs and by wonders. \"The wonder (מופֵת) differs from the sign (אות) in this, that the former denotes the properly marvelous, the extraordinary, the uncommon, consequently the subjective apprehension of the miraculous event; the latter the significant element in the miracle, the reference to the higher, Divine design, the purpose of God in it, consequently to the objective side of the miracle (comp. Deuteronomy 13:2)\" (Havernick, 'Comment. ub. Ezech,' p. 161). By war (cf. Exodus 14:14; Exodus 15:3-10); by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm (Exodus 6:6; Exodus 14:8; Deuteronomy 5:15); and by great terrors (Exodus 12:30-36), the effect on the Egyptians of the Divine inflictions (cf.

Exodus 20:18-22.) To indicate still further the pre-eminence of Israel, Moses emphasizes the supernatural character of the revelation God had given to them, and the awful manner of its delivery; God spake to them with audible voice, out of heaven, amidst fire, and they heard his words out of the fire. To instruct thee. The verb here used (יָסַד) means primarily to bind and thence to correct, to chasten, which meaning some interpreters would give here. But the word means also to correct by instruction, to instruct or persuade (cf. Isaiah 8:11; Isaiah 28:26; Psalm 16:7); and the connection, both with what precedes and with what follows, requires this meaning here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy4:37VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 37. - And because he loved thy fathers (cf. Genesis 15:5-7; Exodus 13:15-17, etc.). Inasmuch as God had loved their fathers, the patriarchs, and had chosen them their descendants to be his people, and had delivered them out of Egypt, that he might establish them in the Promised Land, having driven out thence nations mightier than they, therefore were they to consider in their heart and acknowledge that Jehovah alone is God, and that in the wide universe there is no other. The apodosis in this sentence begins at ver. 39, and not, as in the Authorized Version, at \"he chose,\" in ver. 37, nor at \"brought thee,\" as some suggest. Because he loved thy fathers, and chose his [i.e. Abraham's] seed after him, and brought thee, etc., - for all this thou shalt keep his statutes, etc. In his sight; literally, in his face, i.e. in his presence, by himself present with them; with special reference to Exodus 33:14, where the same word is used as here.

A short historical notice is here inserted, probably because it was during the interval between the first and second addresses of Moses that he carried into effect the Divine command to appoint cities of refuge for the manslayer (Numbers 35:9, etc.; cf. Exodus 21:13). This notice, therefore, is here in its proper place in the order of the narrative. That Moses should, just at this stage, have made this appointment was fitting and proper, seeing he had been urging on the people obedience to the Divine statutes and commandments, and had represented their conquest of the territory of Sihon and Og as an earnest of their ultimate possession of the whole land of the Amorites. By appointing these cities, Moses gave an example of obedience to God's injunction, and, at the same time, not only asserted on the part of Israel a right of proprietorship in this trans-Jordanic territory, but assumed as certain that, on the ether side of Jordan also, the same right of proprietorship should be possessed and exercised by Israel in the fulfilling of the whole law concerning cities of refuge (cf. Deuteronomy 19:1, etc.). That this section belongs properly to Numbers 35, 36, and has been interpolated here by some later hand, is a pure assumption, for which there is no ground.

God spoke to them immediately, in their presence and to their face, from the mount, as one person might to another. There is a slight difference in form between the phrase here and that in Exodus 33:11 and Deuteronomy 34:10, where it is used in reference to Moses, but it is so slight (בְּפָּנִים instead of אֶל־פָּנִים) that no difference of meaning can be elicited. God spake directly to the people, as he did to Moses, only Moses was admitted to closer communion with him than the people were. This difference is sufficiently indicated in ver. 5, where the mediatory function of Moses, in the promulgation of the Law and the making of the covenant, is described as necessitated by the fear of the people, and their not going up into the mount (cf. Exodus 19:19, etc.). This is referred to more fully afterwards (ver. 23, etc.). I stood between the Lord and you; i.e. acted as mediator; LXX., εἱστήκειν ἀνὰ μέσον (cf. Galatians 3:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - I am Jehovah thy God. \"The Law, the establishing rule for men, can proceed only from him who alone and over all stands fast; i.e. from God, specially as Jehovah.

On these, as the basis of the covenant, the whole legislation rests, and therefore a rehearsal of them is a fitting introduction to a repetition and enforcement of the laws of the theocracy. Some differences appear between the statement of the \"ten words,\" as given here and as given in Exodus 20. It is chiefly in the fourth commandment that these are to be found. It begins here with \"remember\" for \"keep;\" reference is made to the command of God as sanctioning the Sabbath (ver. 12), which is omitted in Exodus; a fuller description of the animals to be exempted from work on that day is given (ver. 14); the words, \"that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou\" are added (ver. 14); and in place of a reference to the resting of God after the Creation as the ground of the Sabbath institute, as in Exodus, there is here a reference to the deliverance of the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt as a reason why the Lord commanded them to keep the Sabbath day (ver. 15). In the fifth commandment there are two additions here-the one of the words,\" as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee,\" and the other of the words, \"that it may go well with thee\" (ver. 16). In the tenth commandment, the first two clauses are transposed, \"desire\" appears in place of \"covet\" in relation to \"wife,\" and \"field\" is added to the specification of objects (ver. 21). These differences are of little moment. The only one demanding notice is that in the fourth commandment, where different reasons are assigned for the ordinance of the Sabbath. The two reasons assigned, however, are perfectly compatible; the one is fundamental and universally applicable, the other is subsidiary and special in its application; the one is a reason why the Sabbath was originally instituted and is for all men, the other is a reason why it was specially and formally instituted in Israel and was especially memorable to that people. In a popular address to them it seems fitting that the latter rather than the former should be the one adduced. As a memorial of their deliverance from Egypt, the Sabbath was all important to them, for by it they were constantly reminded that \"they were thereby freed from the dominion of the world to be a peculiar possession of Jehovah, and so amid the toil and trouble of the world had part in the holy rest of their God\" (Baumgarten). It was also fitting in a recapitulatory address that special emphasis should be laid on the fact that what the Law enunciated was what \"the Lord had commanded.\" The addition of \"field\" in the tenth commandment is probably due to the fact that now, the occupation and division of the land having begun, the people were about to have, what they had not before - each his own property in land. In the tenth commandment, also, there is a difference in the two accounts worthy of notice. In Deuteronomy, \"field\" is added to the enumeration of objects not to be coveted, and the \"wife\" is put first and apart, while in Exodus the \"house\" precedes the \"wife\" and the latter ranks with the rest. In Deuteronomy also this separation of the wife is emphasized by a change of the verb: \"Neither shalt thou desire (תַּחְמֹד) thy neighbor's wife, neither shalt thou covet (תִּתְאַוָּה) thy neighbor's house,\" etc. Verses 7-16. - FIRST TABLE OF THE LAW praecepta pietatis. Verse 7. - In this, the first commandment, the great principle and basis of all true religion is asserted - monotheism, as opposed to polytheism or pantheism There is but one God, and that God is Jehovah, the self-existent and eternal, who yet has personal relations with men.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-10. - Here the spirituality of God is asserted, and, in the prohibition of the use of images in the worship of the Deity, all idolatry is denounced, and all deification of the powers of nature in any sense is prohibited. By the Jews, this commandment was not always regarded, for they were not infrequently seduced into following the idolatrous usages of the nations around them. It does not appear, however, that, though they set up images of the idol-gods whom they were thus led to worship, they ever attempted to represent by image or picture the great God whom their fathers worshipped - Jehovah - by whom this command was given; and at a later period, when they had long renounced all idolatry, they became noted as the one nation that adored the Deity as a spirit, without any sensible representation of him: \"Judaei mente sola unumque Numen intelligunt... igitur nulla simulacra urbibus suis, nedum temples sinunt\" (Tacit., 'Hist.,' 5:5). It appears that, by many of them at least, the commandment was regarded as prohibiting absolutely the graphic and plastic arts (Philo, 'Quis Rer. Div. Haer. sit.,' p. 496, edit. Mangey; ' De Ebriet.,' p. 374; ' De Gigant.,' p. 270). This may account for the low state of these arts among the Jews, and for the fact that they alone of the civilized nations of antiquity have left no monuments of art for the instruction or admiration of posterity. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; LXX., προσκυνήσιες αὐτοῖς οὐδὲ μή λατρεύσης αὐτοῖς. Every kind of worship of images is forbidden, alike that of proskunesis and that of latria. And showing mercy unto thousands; i.e. to the thousandth generation (cf. Deuteronomy 7:9)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; literally, Thou shalt not take [or lift] up the Name of Jehovah thy God to vanity. This commandment forbids not only all false swearing by the Name of God, but all profanation of that Name by an irreverent or light use of it (Leviticus 19:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKeep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-14. - Keep the Sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee. This phraseology implies that the Sabbath institute was already well known to the people of Israel; so that this commandment was intended, not to enact a new observance, but to enforce the continuance of an observance which had come down to them from earlier times. The Sabbath was to be kept by being sanctified. This means that it was to be consecrated to God to be used as he had appointed. The sanctification of any object \"always goes back to an act of the Divine will, to Divine election and institution. In other words, it is always a state in which the creature [or institute] is bound to God by the appointment of God himself, which is expressed by קֹדֶשׁ הִקְדִישׁ קִדֵּשׁ קָדושׁ, XXX\" (Oehler, 'Theology of the Old Testament,' vol. 1. p. 155). The sanctification of the Sabbath, accordingly, was the consecration of that day to the Lord, to be observed as he had enjoined, that is, as a day of rest from all servile work and ordinary occupations. Among the Jews, those who were careful to keep this law \"rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment\" (Luke 23:56). Not, however, in mere indolence and idle vacancy, unworthy of a man. Not thus could the day be sanctified to the Lord. Man had to \"release his soul and body from all their burdens, with all the professions and pursuits of ordinary life, only in order to gather himself together again in God with greater purity and fewer disturbing elements, and renew in him the might of his own better powers\" (Ewald, 'Antiquities of Israel,' p. 102). In the Sabbath institute, therefore, lies the basis of spiritual worship and pious service in Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSix days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHonour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The germ of society is the family, and the family is sustained only as the authority and rule of the heads of the house are upheld and respected. The command, then, to honor parents may be justly regarded as asserting the foundation of all social ordinances and arrangements. Where parents are not honored, a flaw lies at the basis, and the stability of the entire social fabric is endangered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt not kill.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17-21. - SECOND TABLE OF THE LAW: praecepta probitatis. In the enactments of the second table there is a progression from the outward to the inward. First, sins of deed are prohibited, such as murder, adultery, and theft; then sins of word, such as injury of a neighbor's good name by false testimony; and finally, sins of the heart, which do not come into open manifestation, such as covetousness and evil desire. The \"commandment\" is thus seen to be\" exceeding broad\" (Psalm 119:96). So that only the man \"who hath clean hands and a pure heart, and who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully,\" shall \"ascend into the hill of the Lord, or stand in his holy place\" (Psalm 24:8, 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou commit adultery.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou steal.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNeither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more.

Verse 22. - And he added no more. \"Only these ten words did God speak immediately to you; all the rest he spoke afterwards by me\" (Herxheimer); cf. Numbers 11:25, where the same formula occurs, \"and they added not,\" i.e. they prophesied only when the Spirit of God came on them, but this was not continuous.

God looks upon the heart, and will accept no service or worship that is not rendered from the heart. Only they who do his will from the heart (Ephesians 6:6) really fear and keep his commandments. The tongue may sometimes promise what the heart does not guarantee; and so when the occasion that provoked the utterance has passed, the whole may be forgotten, and the promise never be fulfilled.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTO that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:30VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGo say to them, Get you into your tents again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 30, 31. - The people were commanded to return to their tents, and Moses was appointed to act as mediator between God and them, receiving from him his commandments and communicating them to the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:31VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy5:32VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 32, 33. - Moses winds up this part of his discourse by exhorting them to observe and do all God's commandments, not in any way departing from that course of action to which he had called them, that they might live, and it should be well with them in the land they were about to possess.

Being about to enjoin upon the people the commandments they were to obey in the land on which they were about to enter, Moses prefaces this with a general announcement of what he was about to deliver, and with a statement of the reason for such deliverance, and of the benefits that would flow from the observance of what should be enjoined. Verse 1. - These are the commandments. In the Hebrew it is, This is the commandment, i.e. the sum and substance of the Divine enactment; equivalent to \"the Law\" (Deuteronomy 4:44). \"The statutes and judgments\" (rights) are in apposition to \"the commandment,\" and explain it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The reason for this announcement of the Law was that the people might fear the Lord, so as to keep all that he enjoined, they and their children, from generation to generation, and that they might thereby continue long in life, and in the enjoyment of the advantages accruing from the land of which they were about to take possession.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - God had promised from the first to the patriarchs that he would make of their posterity a great nation (Genesis 12:1; Genesis 17:6; Genesis 18:18). But the fulfillment of this promise was conditioned by their continuing as a people in the fear of God, and in obedience to his Law. Everything, then, depended on their hearing what Moses had been commanded to teach them, and observing to do it (cf. Leviticus 26:9, etc.). In the land, etc. This is to be connected with the clause, \"that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily;\" the land was to be the scene and sphere of their prosperity and increase. Some would render thus: \"As the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee a laud,\" etc., i.e. a place in which thou mayest prosper and increase; the other, however, is the more natural construction and rendering. There is, indeed, no preposition before \"the land\" in the Hebrew; but nothing is more common in that language than for the accusative of a noun to be used adverbially to describe the place where anything is done. Milk and honey; emblem of fruitfulness and sweetness (Song of Solomon 4:11); proverbially descriptive of Canaan, as rich in pasturage for flocks, and abounding in flowers whence the bees could extract honey (cf. Exodus 3:8, 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-25. - THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT. \"In the fear of Jehovah all true obedience is rooted (vers. 2, 3); for this is the first and most intimate fact in the relation of Israel and Jehovah (Deuteronomy 5:26). But where the supreme fear of Jehovah hinders men from allowing self to preponderate in opposition to God, there will be no stopping at this renunciation of self-will, though this comes first as the negative form of the ten commandments also shows, but there will come to be a coalescence of the human with the Divine will; and this is love, which is the proper condition of obedience, as the ten commandments also indicate (Deuteronomy 5:10)\" (Baumgarten). Verse 4. - Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord. This is an affirmation not so much of the moneity as of the unity and simplicity of Jehovah, the alone God. Though Elohim (plu.), he is one. The speaker does not say, \"Jehovah is alone God,\" but \"Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah\" (comp. for the force of אֶחָד, Exodus 26:6, 11; Ezekiel 37:16-19). Among the heathen there were many Baals and many Jupiters; and it was believed that the deity might be divided and communicated to many. But the God of Israel, Jehovah, is one, indivisible and incommunicable. He is the Absolute and the Infinite One, who alone is to be worshipped, on whom all depend, and to whose command all must yield obedience (cf. Zechariah 14:9). Not only to polytheism, but to pantheism, and to the conception of a localized or national deity, is this declaration of the unity of Jehovah opposed. With these words the Jews begin their daily liturgy, morning and evening; the sentence expresses the essence of their religious belief; and so familiar is it to their thought and speech that, it is said, they were often, during the persecution in Spain, betrayed to their enemies by the involuntary utterance of it.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - To the one indivisible Jehovah undivided devotion and love are due. Hence the injunction, Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. The \"heart\" is the inner nature of the man, including his intellectual, emotional, and cognitive futurities; the \"soul\" is the personality, the entire self-consciousness; and the\" might\" is the sum of the energies, bodily and mental. Not by profession merely is Jehovah to be loved; the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, is to be yielded to him in holy and devout affection (cf. Matthew 22:37; Mark 12:33; Luke 10:27; Romans 12:1). The last letter Of the first word, and the last letter of the last word in this verse are larger than the ordinary size (majuscula), and as these two form the word for witness (עד), the Jews say that they are written thus \"that every one may know, when he professes the unity of God, that his heart ought to be intent and devoid of every other thought, because God is a witness, and knoweth everything\" (R. Bechai, fol. 195, quoted by Michaelis, 'Bib.

Hence his words were to be not only in the memory of the people, but laid upon their heart (cf. Deuteronomy 11:18), that they might be ever present to the thought and will. They were also to be inculcated upon their children, and to be the subject of conversation on all fitting occasions between them, the members of their household, and even their casual associates. Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children; literally, Thou shalt sharpen them to thy children, impress them upon them, send them into them like a sharp weapon.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The words of God were to be bound for a sign [a memorial or directory] upon thine hand, the instrument of acting, and to be as frontlets [fillets or bands] between thine eyes, the organs of direction in walking or moving, and so on the forehead, the chamber of thought and purpose; and they were to inscribe them on the posts of their houses, and on their gates. The purport of this is that they were constantly and everywhere to have these commandments of the Lord in view and in mind, so as to undeviatingly observe them. It seems, however, to have been a custom widely prevalent among the ancient Eastern peoples to carry about their persons slips of parchment or some other material, on which were written sentences of moral or religious import; and such sentences they were also wont to inscribe on conspicuous places of their dwellings; usages still to be found among the Moslems (see Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' 3:364; Lane, 'Modern Egypt,' 1:358; Russell, 'Nat. Hist. of Aleppo;' Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:216), and the latter of which was not altogether unknown among Western nations (cf. Virgil, 'Georg.' lit. 26, etc.), of which traces may still be seen in Switzerland, Germany, and on old houses in both England and Scotland. This custom originated, probably, in a desire to have the sentiments inscribed always in mind; but for the most part these inscriptions came to be regarded as amulets or charms, the presence of which on the person or the house was a safeguard against evil influences, especially such as were supernatural. By the Jews this custom was followed; and they regarded it as authorized by the injunction of Moses in this passage. Taking his words literally, they had their tôtâphoth and their mezuzah, the former of which - the phylacteries of the New Testament - were strips of parchment, on which passages of the Law (Exodus 13:2-10, 11-17; Deuteronomy 6:4-10, 13-22) were written, and these, enclosed in a box, were bound on the forehead and left wrist, and worn at prayers by the worshippers; the latter a slip of parchment, on which were written certain passages of Scripture (vers. 4-9; Deuteronomy 11:13-21), and which, enclosed in a reed or cylinder, was fixed on the right-hand doorpost of every room in the house (see arts. 'Mezuzah' and 'Phylacteries' in Kitto's 'Biblical Cyclopedia,' 3rd edit.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 10-12. - As the Israelites were about to enter upon the possession of a rich and fertile land, where everything for their accommodation and comfort was already provided for them, there was a danger of their being so engrossed with their new possessions as to forget the Lord and his gracious dealings with them. They are, therefore, here warned against the danger to which they would be thus exposed.

The fear of the Lord - that reverent awe which is akin to love - is the beginning of wisdom and the foundation of piety; where it is in the heart it will lead to serving of the Lord in holy obedience; and they in whom it dwells will swear by his Name, recognizing his presence and omniscience, and not daring to asseverate anything but what they know to be true. Thus, really believing in God and reverently worshipping him, the Israelites would be careful not to go after other gods, or to give to any object that homage which is due unto Jehovah alone, knowing that this he will not endure or suffer with impunity; for he is a jealous God, and them that thus dishonor him he will destroy (Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 4:24, etc.). Thus also they should be kept from murmuring against God, and thereby tempting him - putting him, as it were, to the proof, and calling in question his presence and his power, as they had done at Massah (Exodus 17:1-7). Without this genuine religious principle there will be no sincere worship, no true reverence, no real obedience, rendered unto God. But where this dwells in the heart it will influence the whole life, so that the commandments of God shall be diligently kept, and that which is good and right in his sight shall be done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTART(For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTo cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - To cast out, etc.; rather, to the castling out of, etc. The infin, here expresses the carrying out of the action intimated in the words,\" that it may be well with thee\" (cf.

When asked by their sons the meaning and reason of the commandments and institutes which they observed, they were to show them what the Lord had done for his people in bringing them out of Egypt and establishing them in Canaan, and how he had enjoined on them all these statutes that they might fear Jehovah their God for their good always, and for their preservation and safety.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy6:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Signs and wonders (cf.

Genesis 15:19-21.) Of the ten nations named by God in his promise to Abraham, only six are mentioned here, those omitted being the Kenites, the Kennizites, the Kadmonites, and the Rephaim. The Rephaim were by this time extinct as a tribe, Og, \"the last of the Rephaim,\" having been conquered, and he and his people destroyed by the Israelites. The three other tribes lay probably beyond the confines of Canaan, in that region promised to Abraham, but which was not included in the territory conquered by the people under Joshua. This may account for their not being mentioned here. One nation, the Hivites, appears here which is not in the enumeration in Genesis. This name seems to have been borne by more tribes than one, or by a tribe existing in divisions widely scattered, for we find the Hivite in the center of Palestine (Genesis 34:2), in the Shephelah (Joshua 9:7; Joshua 11:19), in the laud of Mizpeh under Hermon (Joshua 11:3), \"in Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entering in of Hamath\" (Judges 3:3), and among tribes in the north of Canaan (Genesis 10:17; 1 Chronicles 1:15).

Verse 5. - Cut down their groves; rather, cut or hew in pieces their asherahs. These were, apparently, wooden pillars of considerable height, which were firmly planted in the ground (comp. Judges 6:25-27; Deuteronomy 16:21)? and were consecrated to the worship of a female deity, the companion of Baal; probably the same as that after-war, is known as Astarte, the Venus of the Syrians (see note on Deuteronomy 16:21).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - An holy people; a people consecrated to God, to be holy as he is holy (cf. Leviticus 11:43-45; Leviticus 19:2; Leviticus 20:26; Leviticus 21:6; Deuteronomy 23:14). A special people unto himself; literally, to be to him for a people of property (סְגֻלָּה), a people his own, his peculiar property (cf. Exodus 19:5; Deuteronomy 14:2; Deuteronomy 26:18; and, for the meaning of the word, 1 Chronicles 29:3, \"mine own proper good;\" Ecclesiastes 2:8, \"peculiar treasure of kings\"); LXX., λαὸς περιούσιος, applied by St. Paul to Christians as the chosen and special property of Christ (Titus 2:14:).

The Hebrew verb meaning primarily to cleave to, to be attached to, is used to express ardent and loving affection (cf. Genesis 34:8; Deuteronomy 10:15; Isaiah 38:17). The fewest of all people. It might have been supposed that, in choosing a people to be his special treasure, the Almighty would have selected some one of the great nations of the world; but, instead of that, he had chosen one of the smallest. They had, indeed, grown till now they were as the stars for multitude; but it was not in prospect of this that they were chosen. The election of Israel was purely of grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Because the Lord loved you. Targum Onkelos, \"Because he had complacency in you;\" Vulgate, quia vobis junctus est. \"Instead of saying, He hath chosen you out of love to your fathers, as in Deuteronomy 4:37, Moses brings out in this place love to the people of Israel as the Divine motive, not for choosing Israel, but for leading it out and delivering it from the slave-house of Egypt, by which God had practically carried out the election of the people, that he might thereby allure the Israelites to a reciprocity of love\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnow therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - To a thousand generations; rather, to the thousandth generation. As God is faithful to his covenant, and will show mercy and do good to those that love him, whilst on those who hate him he will bring terrible retribution, the people are warned by this to take heed against rebellion and apostasy from him (comp. Exodus 20:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And repayeth them that hate him to their face. The phrase, \"to their face \"(אל פָנָיו, to their faces), has been variously explained. It has been taken as meaning, instantly, statim, hand cunctanter (Vulgate, Gesenius); openly, manifestly, palam (Grotius, Calvin, Michaelis); during life, in hac vita (Targum, Vatab.); in their presence, in their own sight (LXX., κατὰ πρόσωπον: Rosenmüller). The last seems the best. פָנֶהּ signifies properly, front, and אֶל פָנִים, to the front, before, in presence (cf. Leviticus 9:5; Exodus 23:17). The hater of God should be repaid, so that the man should himself see and feel that he had been smitten of God (cf. Isaiah 65:6; Job 34:11; Psalm 62:13 [Psalm 62:12]). And this retribution should come speedily: He will not be slack to him that hateth him; i.e. he will not delay to repay him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As God would thus summarily avenge himself of his adversaries, the people are exhorted to keep all his commandments, statutes, and rights.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - On the other hand, obedience would bring blessing. Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken. The Hebrew conveys the idea of a reward as consequent on their hearkening; as there would be retribution for transgression, so would there be recompense for obedience. The Hebrew word represented by \"wherefore\" in the Authorized Version (עֵקֶב, from עָקֵב, the heel) denotes that which comes after, the end or last of anything (Psalm 119:33, 112), hence recompense, reward, wages, as the end or result of acting (Psalm 19:11; Psalm 40:15; Isaiah 5:23, etc.). The clause might, therefore, be translated, As a consequence or recompense of hearkening.... it shall be that, &c. Judgments, i.e. rights, rightful claims (מִשְׁפֻטִים). God, as the Great King, has his rights, and these are to be rendered to him by his subjects and servants. The mercy, i.e. the kindness, the favor (חֶסֶד), showed in the promises which God gave to their fathers, and engaged by covenant to fulfill.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - This favor would take effect in a blessing on the fruit of the womb, the produce of the field, and the increase of their flocks and herds (comp. Exodus 23:25-27). Thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. These comprise the fruitful products of the soil, and in their combination express general fertility and abundance. By corn (דִנָן) is undoubtedly to be understood the cereal products generally used for food. It may be doubted if tirosh (תִרושׂ), properly means wine. The word is often rendered in the Authorized Version by new wine, and this is the meaning generally given in the lexicons. As, however, it is almost constantly joined with corn and oil, the immediate products of the soil - at least as unchanged by any process or manufacture - it is rather to be regarded as designating ripe grapes than wine. That, moreover, which was to be gathered (Deuteronomy 11:14), which might be tithed (Deuteronomy 12:17; Deuteronomy 14:23), which might be described as fruit (2 Chronicles 31:5), as being in the cluster (Isaiah 65:8), and as capable of being dried up or parched (Joel 1:10), and trodden (Micah 7:15), could not be a fluid like fermented nine. As the grape juice, however, was that from which wine was elicited, tirosh is sometimes used tropically for wine (Isaiah 62:8; Hosea 4:11), Just as corn is used for bread (Lamentations 2:12; Hosea 7:14). The oil here mentioned, and elsewhere joined with dagan and tirosh, is the pure fresh olive oil (יִצְהָר, from צָהַר, to shine), obtained by pressure from the berries of the olive, and used for food as well as for other purposes by the Jews (see notes on Deuteronomy 8:8). Flocks of thy sheep. The Hebrew is very peculiar here; the same expression occurs only in this book (Deuteronomy 28:4, 18, 51). Literally rendered, it is the Astartes (Ashtaroth) of thy sheep. Kimchi says it means \"the females of the sheep\" (נקבות הצאן), and this Gesenius adopts, rendering the phrase by \"ewes.\" Astarte ('Ash-toreth, plu. 'Ashtaroth) was the Phoenician Venus, and it is supposed that the females of the flock were called Astartes orVenuses, as propagating the flock. There is, however, another way of explaining the word as here used, by referring it to a root 'ashar (עָשַׁר), signifying to be multiplied, to be rich; whence the name given to the females as the multipliers of the flock, without any reference to Astarte.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The mercy of God should be showed to them also in preserving them from sickness, especially of a virulent and dangerous kind, such as they had seen in Egypt, where disease has in all ages readily assumed a malignant character ('Encyc.

Such diseases the Lord would rather cause to fall on their enemies.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-26. - The heathen they were utterly to extirpate from the land which God was about to give them; mighty as these nations were, they were not to be afraid of them, for God would be with his people, and would deliver these nations, with their kings, into their hands. Not all at once, however, should the former occupants of the country be driven out; this should be done by degrees, lest, the land being suddenly depopulated, the wild animals would increase too much, so as to be a source of danger and trouble to the settlers; but ultimately they should be utterly destroyed, and with them all the objects and implements of their idolatrous worship. Verse 16. - And thou shalt consume; literally, eat, devour (וְאָכַלְתָּ). Unless they consumed them as one consumes food, they would be a snare to them, by tempting them to join in their idolatry.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy7:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIf thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - If thou shalt say in thine heart.

Instances are on record of armies being obliged to give way before swarms of insects by which they were attacked (as in the case of Julian, who was compelled by a host of flies and gnats to change his route in retreating from Parthia; Atom. Marcell., 24, 8); but it may be doubted if the statement here is to be understood literally, and not rather figuratively, as expressive of many and varied evils with which the fugitive Canaanites were to be visited until they were extirpated (cf.

He humbled them that he might test the state of their heart and affections towards him, using the distress and privations to which they were subjected as means of bringing out what was in them, and of leading them to feel their entire dependence on him for help, sustenance, and guidance. Not only by commands difficult to be obeyed laid on men, and by mighty works done in their view, does God prove men (cf. Genesis 22:1, etc.; Exodus 15:25; Exodus 20:20); but also by afflictions and calamities (Judges 2:22; 3:4; Psalm 17:3; Psalm 81:7, etc.), as well as by benefits (Exodus 16:4). Humbled so as to see his own weakness, chastised out of all self-conceit by affliction, man is brought to submit to God, to hear and obey him; and along with this the experience of God's goodness tends to draw men, in grateful acknowledgment of his mercy and bounty, to yield themselves to him and sincerely and lovingly to serve him (cf. Romans 2:4). Verses 1, 2. - God's dealings with the Israelites were disciplinary. Both by the afflictions and privations to which they were subjected, and by the provision they received and the protection afforded to them, God sought to bring them into and keep them in a right state of mind towards him - a state of humble dependence, submissive obedience, and hopeful trust. But that this effect should be produced, it was needful that they should mark and remember all his ways towards them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - God humbled the Israelites by leaving them to suffer hunger from the want of food, and then supplying them with food in a miraculous manner. They were thus taught that their life depended wholly on God, who could, by his own creative power, without any of the ordinary means, provide for the sustaining of their life. And fed thee with manna (cf. Exodus 16:15). It is in vain to seek to identify this with any natural product. It was something entirely new to the Israelites - a thing which neither they nor their fathers knew; truly bread from heaven, and which got from them the name of manna or man, because, in their wondering ignorance, they knew not what to call it, and so they said one to another, Manhoo? (מָן הוּא), What is it? and thenceforward called it man. That he might make thee know, etc. \"Bread,\" which the Jews regarded as \"the staff of life,\" stands here, as in other places, for food generally; and the lesson taught the Israelites was that not in one way or by. one kind of means alone could life be sustained, but in the absence of these God could, by his own fiat, provide for the sustenance of his children. Every word - literally, all, everything whatever - that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, i.e. all means which God has by his word provided, or by his word can provide, for the sustenance of life. So our Lord cites this passage in replying to the tempter, who had suggested that if he was the Son of God he might relieve himself from the pangs of hunger by commanding the stones which lay around to become bread. Our Lord's reply to this is virtually.\" I have this power, and could use it, but I will not; for this would imply impatience and distrust of God, who has engaged to sustain the life of his servants, and who can, by the mere word of his mouth, by his creative will, provide in an extraordinary way for the sustenance of life when the ordinary means of life are wanting.\" \"Jesus means to say, ' I leave it with God to care for the sustaining of my life, and I will not arbitrarily and for selfish ends help myself by a miracle'\" (De Wette, note on Matthew 4:4; see also Meyer on the place).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - As the manna furnished by God's creative power saved them from hunger, so by God's providence and care their raiment was marvelously kept from decay, and they had not to go barefoot from their sandals being worn out. Waxed not old upon thee; literally, did not fall away, waste away from upon thee. This cannot mean that such was the abundant supply of raiment to the Israelites in the Arabian desert, that there was no need for them to wear garments rent and tattered from long use, as they had large flocks and herds whence a sufficient supply of wool and leather could be obtained, and there were among them skilled artificers, by whom these could be made into articles of clothing (Rosenmüller, J. D. Michaelis, etc.). For, as Knobel observes, \"This were something too insignificant beside the miraculous manna; and besides, this does not lie in the expression, which rather intimates that the clothes upon them were not worn out nor fell from them in rags, because God gave them a marvelous durability.\" At the same time, there is no reason to suppose that the Israelites did not make use of such supplies as were within their reach for purposes of clothing, any more than that they lived only on manna during the forty years of their wandering. Still less need we resort to such fanciful suppositions as that the garments of the Israelitish children expanded as they grew up, like the shells of snails - which is the notion of some of the Jewish rabbins, and adopted by some of the Christian Fathers (see Deyling, 'Obss. Sacc.,' II. 17. p. 247). Neither did thy foot swell. The verb here is found in only one other passage (Nehemiah 9:21), where this passage is repeated; and the meaning is doubtful. The LXX. render here by ἐτυλώθησαν, became callous; but in Nehemiah the rendering they give is διερράγησαν, were torn, the object torn being, according to the Cod. Vat., πόδες abbey, their feet, according to the Cod. Alex., τὰ ὑποδήματα αφφραψ, their sandals. In Deuteronomy 29:5, the shoe or sandal is specially mentioned in the same connection as here. The verb, however, cannot mean tear or torn, neither does it mean swell; the idea involved is rather that of softening, or , melting or flowing; and the meaning here seems to be, \"Thy foot did not get into a bruised and wounded state\" - which would have been the case had their sandals not been preserved from breaking or being worn out.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Thus God educated, disciplined, and trained his people as a father does his child. Chasteneth. The idea is not so much that of punishment or chastisement, properly so called, as that of severe discipline and training. God made them feel his hand upon them, but ever for their good; the end of the discipline to which they were subjected was that they might keep his commandments and walk in his ways, so as to enjoy his favor (cf. Hebrews 12:5, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-20. - The land on which they were about to enter is described as a good laud, fertile and well watered, and yielding abundant produce to its cultivators; and they are cautioned against forgetting, in their enjoyment of the gift, the bounty of the Giver, or congratulating themselves on having achieved the conquest of such a land, instead of gratefully acknowledging the grace which had sustained them during their protracted wandering in the wilderness, and by which alone they had been enabled to take possession of that favored land. Verses 7, 8 - Brooks of water, running streams, mountain torrents, and watercourses in the narrow valleys or wadys; fountains, perennial springs; depths, \"the fathomless pools from which such streams as the Abana (now Barada), near Damascus, spring up full-grown rivers, almost as broad at their sources as at their mouths\" (Condor, 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 214), or this may include also the inland seas or lakes, such as the sea of Galileo and Lake Haleh. Palestine is in the present day, on the whole, well supplied with water, though the distribution is very unequal, many parts being almost wholly destitute of supply, except from what may be collected from rain in tanks or cisterns; and there is no reason to suppose it was different in the ancient times. As compared, however, with the desert to which the Israelites had been so long accustomed, and even with Egypt from which they had escaped, the country on which they were about to enter was well watered.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - \"Palestine has been celebrated in all ages for three products: corn, wine, and oil, which still continue to be its most valuable crops\" (Ibid., p. 189). The principal corn crops were wheat and barley. The vine was largely and carefully cultivated; the olive required little cultivation, being almost a spontaneous growth, and forming one of the most valuable productions of the country; the fig was also indigenous in Palestine, and still grows there, both wild and cultivated, in abundance; that the pomegranate (firemen) also was very abundant may be inferred from the number of places named from this (cf. Joshua 15:32; Joshua 19:7, 13; Judges 20:45, 47; Judges 21:13; 1 Chronicles 4:32, etc.). Honey. The word so rendered (d'bash) is used both of the honey of bees (Leviticus 2:11; Deuteronomy 32:11; 1 Samuel 14:26, etc.; Psalm 81:17; Proverbs 16:24, etc.), and of the honey of grapes, a syrup obtained by boiling down the newly expressed juice of the grape to a half or third part of its bulk, and still known among the Arabs by the name of dibs (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' it. p. 442; Smith, Bib. Dict.,' s.v. 'Honey'). In the wilderness, the people had murmured that they had been brought into an evil place, no place of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; and where there was no water to drink (Numbers 20:5). Moses here tells them that the land they were about to occupy was not such a place, but one abounding in all those things of which they had found the wilderness so destitute.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTA land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - A land whose stones are iron. Minerals do not abound in Palestine; the hills are for the most part calcareous; but by the side of the limestone in the north of Canaan ferruginous basalt appears in largo masses, and on Lebanon ironstone abounds. Near Tiberius are springs largely impregnated with iron, as are also those at Has-beija, on the Hermon range, as well as the soil around that place. Traces of extinct copper works are also to be found on Lebanon (cf. art. 'Metals,' in Kitto and Smith; Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:248). The Israelites, however, do not seem to have carried on mining operations themselves, but to have been content to obtain supplies of the useful metals from their neighbors (2 Samuel 8:8; 1 Chronicles 18:8; 1 Chronicles 22:3, 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God. \"From this place the Jews have made it a general rule, or, as they call it, an affirmative precept, that every one bless God at their meals, that is, give him thanks for his benefits; for he blesses us when he bestows good things on us, and we bless him when we thankfully acknowledge his goodness therein\" (Patrick).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBeware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-14. - Wealth is apt to engender in the possessor of it a spirit of self-gratulation and pride, and abundance of good things to induce men to be luxurious, \"to trust in uncertain riches,\" and to be forgetful of the bounteous hand from which all that they enjoy has come. Against this the people are here cautioned and warned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage;VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, etc. \"The fiery serpent\" and \"the scorpion\" (sing.) are in apposition to the \"wilderness,\" and illustrate its terribleness. Fiery serpents - ὔφεις τοὺς θανατοῦνσας LXX. - or burning serpents, so called from the burning pain caused by their bite; probably the cerastes, or one of the naja species (cf. Numbers 21:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - The grand end of all God's dealings with the Israelites in the desert, both the trials to which they were subjected and the benefits they received, was that he might do them good ultimately. Thy latter end; not the end of life, as in Numbers 23:10, but the state ensuing on the termination of their period of discipline and probation in the desert (cf. Job 8:7; Job 42:12; 2 Peter 2:20). God thus dealt with the Israelites as he still deals with his people; he afflicts them not for his pleasure but for their profit (Hebrews 11:12); he subjects them to trial and varied discipline that he may fit them for the rest and joy that in the end are to be theirs.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 17, 18. - The blessing in store for them was God's free gift to them; and when they came to enjoy it they were not to allow themselves to say in their heart, i.e. to think or imagine, that the prosperous condition in which they were placed was the result of their own exertions; they were to ascribe all to God's gracious bounty, for from him had come the power by which prosperity had been gained, and this he had given, not on account of any merit in them, but that he might fulfill his covenant engagements to their fathers. Get wealth עָשָׂה חַיִל, to make strength, to gather substance (Genesis 12:5), to procure wealth (Ruth 4:11, margin; Ezekiel 28:4). As it is this day. \"As was quite evident then, when the establishment of the covenant had already commenced, and Israel had come through the desert to the border of Canaan (see Deuteronomy 4:20)\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 19, 20. - Moses enforces his counsel by reminding them again that only destruction awaited them should they forget the Lord their God and apostatize from him (cf.

The expression corresponds to ver. 1, \"Thou art to pass... and thou knowest.\" In the victory they had obtained over Sihon and Og, they had already had experience of the Lord's going before them, and leading them on in triumph. The repetition of the He in this verse is very emphatic. Consuming fire (cf. Deuteronomy 4:24). Quickly, or suddenly. There is no contradiction here of what is said in Deuteronomy 7:22; for there the reference is to the possession of the land by Israel, here it is to the destruction which was to come on the Canaanites - the former was to be by degrees, the latter was to come suddenly and overwhelmingly. As Jehovah hath said unto thee (cf. Exodus 23:23, 27, etc.; Deuteronomy 2:24, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSpeak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4, 5. - Speak not thou in thine heart (cf. Deuteronomy 8:17). The distinction between righteousness and uprightness (straightness) of heart, is that the former (צֶדֶ) has reference to rectitude of conduct, the latter (ישֶׁר) to rectitude of motive and purpose. \"By naming justice [righteousness], he excludeth all merit of works, and by righteousness [uprightness] of heart, all inward affections and purposes. which men might plead, notwithstanding that they fail in action.

Their rebellion began even before they had wholly escaped from their oppressors, before they had passed through the Bed Sea (Exodus 14:11). Even at Horeb, where, amid the most affecting manifestations alike of the Divine majesty and the Divine grace, just after the Lord had spoken to them directly out of the fire, and whilst Moses had gone up to receive the tables of the Law, on which the covenant of God with Israel was based, and whilst that covenant was being struck, they had sinned so grievously as to make to themselves a molten image, which they worshipped with idolatrous rites (Exodus 31:18-32:6; cf.

Let me alone; literally, Desist from me, i.e. Do not by pleadings and entreaties attempt to prevent me; in Exodus 32:10 the expression used is, \"Let me rest; leave me in quiet (הַנָּיחָה לִי); cease to urge me.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFurthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLet me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Moses cast from him the two tables of stone on which God had inscribed the words of the Law, and broke them in pieces in the view of the people, when he came down from the mount and saw how they had turned aside from the right way, and were become idolaters. This was not the effect of a burst of indignation on his part; it was a solemn declaration that the covenant of God with his people had been nullified and broken by their sinful apostasy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-20. - Moses interceded with God for the people before he came down from the mount (Exodus 22:11, etc.); but this he passes over here, merely referring to it in the words, \"as at the first,\" and makes special mention only of a subsequent intercession, that mentioned in Exodus 34:28. In the account in Exodus nothing is said of Moses interceding for Aaron specially, as well as for the people generally; but prominence is given to this here, \"not only that he might make the people thoroughly aware that at that time Israel could not boast even of the righteousness of its eminent men (cf. Isaiah 43:27), but also to bring out the fact, which is described still more fully in Deuteronomy 10:6, sqq., that Aaron's investiture with the priesthood and the maintenance of this institution was purely a work of Divine grace\" (Keil). That Aaron, however, was regarded as especially to be blamed in this matter is clearly intimated in Exodus 32:21, 22.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 22-24. - Not only at Horeb, but at other places and on other occasions, had Israel provoked the Lord to wrath by their contumacy. At Taberah, by their complaining and discontent (Numbers 11:1-3); at Massah, by their murmuring because of the want of water (Exodus 17. l, etc.); at Kibroth-hattaavah, by despising the manna, and lusting for flesh to eat (Numbers 11:4, etc.); and at Kadesh-barnea, when on the confines of the Promised Land, they distrusted God, reproached him for having brought them there to be destroyed, and sought to return to Egypt (Numbers 14:1, etc.; Deuteronomy 1:26). \"The list is not arranged chronologically, but advances from the smaller to the morn serious forms of guilt: For Moses was seeking to sharpen the consciences of the people, and to impress upon them the fact that they had been rebellious against the Lord (see at ver. 7) from the very beginning, 'from the day that I knew you'\" (Keil).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLikewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25-29. - Having enumerated these instances of the rebelliousness of the people, Moses reverts to the apostasy at Sinai, in order still more to impress on the minds of the people the conviction that not for any righteousness or merit of theirs, but solely of his own grace, was God fulfilling to them his covenant with their fathers. Verse 25. - Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; rather, the forty days and forty nights in which I fell down. The reference is to the intercession before Moses came down from the mount, described in Exodus 32:11-13. (For the form of the expression, cf. Deuteronomy 1:46.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 26-29. - In these verses the substance of Moses' intercession is given, and it is substantially in agreement with the account in Exodus. Moses pleaded with God not to destroy that people which was his own, which he had redeemed for himself and brought out of Egypt; besought him to remember their pious ancestors, and not to look on the stubbornness and sin of the people; and urged that the Divine honor was concerned in their being conducted to Canaan, and not let perish in the wilderness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTLest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The land, that is, the people of the land, as in Genesis 41:36 - the Egyptians; the verb, accordingly, is in the plural. Were the Israelites to perish in the wilderness, the Egyptians might say that God had destroyed them, either because he was unable to obtain for them the land he had promised them, or because he had ceased to regard them with favor, and had become their enemy. Neither of these could be, for were they not the people of his inheritance, and had he not showed his power already in delivering them out of Egypt? As Moses in this chapter recalls to the remembrance of Israel this and that place, time, and occasion of their sinning, so should each one often seriously reflect on his past life. This conduces to humility, to watchfulness, and to effort at improvement (Herxheimer).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTDeuteronomy9:29VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.VERSEEND"}
