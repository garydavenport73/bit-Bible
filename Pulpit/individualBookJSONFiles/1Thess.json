{"1Thess.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPaul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Paul. He does not call himself \"an apostle,\" not because the Thessalonians were newly converted (Chrysostom), or from tenderness to Silvanus who was not an apostle (Estius), or because his apostolic authority was not yet recognized (Jowett), or because he had merely commenced his apostolic labors (Wordsworth); but because his apostleship had never been called in question by the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits this title in the Epistle to the Philippians; whereas he strongly insists upon it in his Epistles to the Corinthians and Galatians, because among them there were many opposed to his authority. And Silvanus. The same as the Silas of the Acts. He is mentioned as a chief man among the brethren, and a prophet or inspired teacher (Acts 15:22, 32). His Latin name renders it probable that he was a Hellenistic Jew, and, like Paul, he was a Roman citizen (Acts 16:37). He was sent with Judas Barsabas from Jerusalem, to convey the apostolic decrees to Antioch; and he accompanied Paul instead of Barnabas on his second missionary journey (Acts 15:40). He suffered imprisonment with Paul at Philippi; and was engaged with him in preaching the gospel in Thessalonica, Beraea, and Corinth. His ministry at Corinth is honorably mentioned by Paul in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 1:9). After this there is no more mention of Silvanus in the Acts, and it is doubtful whether he was the Silvanus by whom the First Epistle of Peter was conveyed to the Churches of Asia (1 Peter 5:12). Ancient tradition, erroneously supposing that Silas and Silvanus were different persons, makes Silas the Bishop of Corinth, and Silvanus the Bishop of Thessalonica. And Timotheus. The well-known disciple of Paul. He was a native of Lystra, having a Greek father and a Jewish mother (Acts 16:1). He joined Paul and Silas on their second missionary journey at Lystra, and was with them in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth. He was with Paul on his third missionary journey, and was sent by him on a mission to Macedonia and Corinth (Acts 19:22; 1 Corinthians 16:10), and accompanied him into Asia on his last journey to Jerusalem (Acts 20:4). He was also with Paul during his first Roman imprisonment, when he wrote the Epistles to the Philippians and Colossians (Philippians 1:1; Colossians 1:1). Afterwards he resided at Ephesus (1 Timothy 1:3); from which he was recalled to Rome by Paul shortly before his martyrdom (2 Timothy 4:21). The last mention of Timothy is in the Epistle to the Hebrews: \"Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you\" (Hebrews 13:23). According to ecclesiastical tradition, he became Bishop of Ephesus, and there suffered martyrdom. Silvanus and Timotheus are associated with Paul in his address to the Thessalonians, not to give weight and authority to his Epistle, but because they assisted him in the planting of the Church at Thessalonica, and were now with him at Corinth, when he was writing this Epistle. Silvanus is placed first, because he was the older and had been longer with the apostle, and, as is evident from the Acts, was at this time the more important of the two (Acts 16:19; Acts 17:4). By being included in the address, they are represented as joint authors of the Epistle with Paul, although they were only so in name. It is possible that Paul employed one of them as his amanuensis in writing the Epistle. Unto the Church. The word \"Church\" denotes a select assembly; here, Christians selected from the world. It does not denote in the New Testament, as with us, a building, but the congregation. In Paul's later Epistles, those addressed are called, not the Church, but saints. Of the Thessalonians. In other Epistles the address is to the city, as Rome, Philippi, Colosse; here it is to the inhabitants. The Church of the Thessalonians was chiefly composed of converted Gentiles, with a small number of converted Jews (see Introduction). Which is; to be omitted, as not being in the original. In God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ. The characteristic peculiarity of the Church: they are in God and Christ, that is, in fellowship with them, united to them. \"In God the Father\" characterizes them as not being heathens; \"in the Lord Jesus Christ\" characterizes them as not being Jews. Grace be unto you, and peace. The usual apostolic benediction. \"Grace\" is the Greek and\" peace\" is the Jewish form of salutation. The Greeks commenced their epistles with wishing grace for those to whom they wrote; and the usual form of salutation among the Jews was Shalom or \"peace;\" the apostle combines them, thus intimating that both Greeks and Jews are one in Christ Jesus. In the Pastoral Epistles and in the Second Epistle of John the form is \"Grace, mercy, and peace\" (2 John 1:3.), and in the Epistle of Jude it is \"Mercy, peace, and love\" (Jude 1:2). From God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. These words are wanting in some important manuscripts, and are omitted in the R.V. The preponderance, however, of external authority is in their favor.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWe give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - We. Many expositors (Cony-beare, Koch, Jowett) suppose that the plural is here used for the singular; as Paul elsewhere does in other parts of this Epistle. Thus: \"Wherefore we would come unto you, even I Paul, once and again\" (1 Thessalonians 2:18); \"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone\" (1 Thessalonians 3:1). In these verses the pronoun \"we\" is evidently restricted to Paul. Still, however, Silvanus and Timotheus being mentioned directly before, it is most natural to include them here. Give thanks to God always for you all. All Paul's Epistles, with the solitary exception of the Epistle to the Galatians, commence with an expression of thanksgiving. Making mention of you in our prayers; whilst we are engaged in prayer for you. Paul's prayer for the Thessalonians took the form of thanksgiving.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRemembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Remembering without ceasing. Some attach the words, \"without ceasing,\" or \"unceasingly,\" to the previous clause; \"making mention of you unceasingly in our prayers\" (so Alford). Your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope. These expressions are not to be weakened, as if they were a mere Hebraism for active faith, laborious love, and patient hope. We have here the three cardinal virtues - faith, love, and hope (1 Corinthians 13:13). Elsewhere these graces are combined. Thus again in this Epistle: \"Putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation\" (1 Thessalonians 5:8); and in the Epistle to the Colossians: \"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven\" (Colossians 1:4, 5). By the \"work of faith\" is not meant faith itself as the work of God (John 6:29), but that faith which is energetic, which is active and living, productive of good works. By the \"labor, or toil, of love\" is not meant that love which is devoted to God, but that love which manifests itself in acts of kindness toward our fellow-Christians and toward the human race. And by the \"patience of hope\" is meant that constancy which remains unconquered by trials and persecutions. There is a climax here; faith manifests itself by its works - its active exertion; love by its toils - its works of self-denial; and hope by its patience - its endurance amid trials and discouragements. \"Remembering, the apostle would say, your faith, hope, and love: a faith that had its outward effect on your lives; a love that spent itself in the service of others; and a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen, when Christ should be revealed\" (Jowett). In our Lord Jesus Christ. These words do not refer to all three virtues (Hohnann), but only to the last, specifying its object, namely, that it is hope in the advent of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is hope s highest expectation, because at the advent the kingdom of Christ will come in its glory. In the sight of (or rather, before) God and our Father. These words are to be conjoined with \"remembering:\" \"remembering unceasingly before God and our Father your work of faith,\" etc. According to the English idiom, the conjunction \"and\" is dropped - \"God our Father.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTKnowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Knowing; that is, not the Thessalonians themselves, but we, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; knowing, being well assured cf. Brethren beloved, your election of God; or rather, as it is in the margin and in the R.V., Knowing brethren, beloved of God, your election. By election is meant that act of free grace by which God destines individuals to become believers in Christ. Thus the Thessalonian converts were chosen or elected by God from among their heathen countrymen to become Christians. The ultimate reason of their Christianity was their election of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For; or rather, how that (R.V.); or, because; assigning the reasons for Paul's confidence in their election; and these reasons were two: first, the powerful entrance which the gospel had among them; and secondly, the joyful reception which was given to it by the Thessalonians. Our gospel; that is, the gospel which was preached by us. Came not unto you in word only. The gospel came in word, for this was a necessary pre-requisite, but \"not in word only,\" that is, it was not a bare publication or communication in human words. But in power. Some restrict the epithets which here follow to the teachers, as denoting the mode in which they preached the gospel; but it is better to refer them both to the teachers and the taught. By \"power\" is not meant miracles, but, in contrast to \"word,\" the power with which Paul and his companions preached, and the impression which the gospel made on the hearers. And in the Holy Ghost. Here also the reference is, not to miraculous gifts, but to the influences of the Spirit accompanying the preaching of the gospel; such was the efficacy of Paul's preaching that it proved itself to be accompanied by the operation of the Holy Ghost in the conversion of his hearers. There is here an ascent: the gospel came in power, and, what is more, it came in the Holy Ghost. And in much assurance. By \"assurance\" here is meant the confidence with which Paul and his fellow-workers preached the gospel to the Thessalonians, and the fullness of conviction with which the Thessalonians received it. As ye know. An appeal to their knowledge that what he now states is true. What manner of men we were among you. Alluding to the blamelessness of their behavior when in Thessalonica. For your sake; namely, that we sought not our own profit or advantage, but your spiritual good.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Now follows the second reason assigned by Paul for his confidence in their election. And ye became followers (or, imitators) of us, and of the Lord; of Christ. By becoming imitators of the apostle, they became imitators of Christ. \"Be ye followers of me,\" writes St. Paul to the Corinthians, \"even as I also am of Christ\" (1 Corinthians 11:1). The point of imitation did not consist in their cordial reception of the gospel, for that could not apply to Christ; but in their joyful endurance of suffering. Having received the word in much affliction. We learn from the Acts that the unbelieving Jews stirred up the heathen rabble, and raised a persecution against Paul and his associates, in consequence of which they had to depart from Thessalonica (Acts 17:4-10). It would appear that, after the apostle had left the city, the persecution, far from abating, rather increased, and the Gentile inhabitants united with the unbelieving Jews against the Christians; the Thessalonian converts suffered from their own countrymen as well as from the Jews (1 Thessalonians 2:14). With joy of the Holy Ghost; that is, not merely spiritual joy, or joy in the Holy Ghost, but joy which proceeds from the Holy Ghost - joy which is produced by him, of which he is the Author.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - So that ye were ensamples. The word here rendered \"ensamples\" literally signifies \"types.\" It is used to denote a form or figure (Acts 7:43), a model or likeness (Acts 7:44), a mark or impression (John 20:25). Hence, in a metaphorical sense, it came to signify an example, a pattern for imitation. \"Now these things are our examples\" (1 Corinthians 10:6). To all that believe - to all believers - in Macedonia and Achaia. These are the two provinces into which ancient Greece was divided by the Romans, each of which was governed by a proconsul Macedonia was the northern portion, including Macedonia proper, Epirus and Illyricum; at first it was divided into four districts, but afterwards united into one province, of which Thessalonica was constituted the capital. Achaia was the southern portion of ancient Greece, including the Peloponnesus, Attica, Boeotia, etc., and, until recently, was nearly of the same dimensions with the modern kingdom of Greece; its capital was Corinth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For; or, because the proof of tiffs praise conferred on the Thessalonians. From you sounded out. Resounded like the sound of a trumpet. Comp. Romans 10:18, \"Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world.\" The word of the Lord. This does not intimate that the Thessalonians by their missionary activity disseminated the gospel, but that from them locally the-gospel had spread. Not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad. There is a slight difficulty in the construction. The sentence is complete without the addition, \"your faith to God-ward is spread abroad,\" and, therefore, we must consider these words as equivalent to \"from you sounded out the word of the Lord.\" When the apostle says that \"the faith of the Thessalonians is spread abroad in every place,\" the meaning is that the report of their joyful reception of the gospel had excited universal attention. There is here a certain use of the figure hyperbole. The words, \"in every place,\" are not to be taken in their full literal sense, but are merely a strong expression for the wide diffusion of the faith of the Thessalonians. Paul uses similar hyperboles in other places, as when he speaks of the faith of the Romans being spoken of throughout the whole world (Romans 1:5), and of the gospel having come into all the world (Colossians 1:6). This wide diffusion of the Faith of the Thessalonians, notwithstanding the recent date of their conversion, may be accounted for when we consider that Thessalonica and Corinth were two great commercial cities, from and to which there was a constant coming and going, so that reports might easily be transmitted by merchants and strangers. It has also been suggested that Aquila and Priscilla, who had lately come from Rome (Acts 18:2), must in their journey have passed through Thessalonica, and would bring with them to Corinth such a report of the faith of the Thessalonians (Wieseler). So that we need not to speak anything; that is, of your faith, as this is already so well known and applauded.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For they themselves; that is, the reporters, those in Macedonia, Achaia, and every other place. Show of us; or, report concerning us (R.V.) in regard to our preaching or entrance among you. Instead of questions being asked of us by them, as would naturally be expected, they of their own accord give information. What manner of entering in we had among you. \"Entering\" here evidently refers, not merely to the outward entrance, the mere preaching of the gospel among the Thessalonians; but to the access, the internal entrance, which the gospel found into their hearts; that is, with what power and fullness of the Holy Ghost we preached the gospel unto you, and with what joy and confidence and contempt of danger ye received it. And how ye turned to God from idols. This, as already remarked, is one of the proofs that the Church of Thessalonica was chiefly composed of Gentile converts, though, of course, not to the exclusion of the Jewish element (Acts 17:4). To serve the living and true God. Two epithets there employed in contrast to the idols of the heathen: \"living,\" in opposition to dead idols, which were nothing in the world; \"true,\" not in the sense of veracious, but of real in opposition to the imaginary gods of the heathen.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And to wait. The faith of the Thessalonians took the form of hope or expectation for the coming of the Lord; an element of Christian feeling, perhaps, not so prominent in the present day. For his Son from heaven; referring to the second advent. Christ on his departure from this world went to heaven, where he resides, making intercession for us, but from thence he will come to judge the quick and the dead. In the primitive Church the advent of Christ was not regarded as at a distance, but as an event which might at any moment occur. Whom he raised from the dead; with emphasis placed before \"Jesus,\" because his resurrection from the dead was the open declaration, the public inauguration, of his Divine sonship (Romans 1:4). Even Jesus which delivered us. The participle is present; not past, \"who delivered us,\" namely, by his death; nor future, \"who shall deliver us,\" at the judgment; but present,\" who delivers us;\" the deliverance is going on - it commenced with his death, but will not be completed until his advent. Or the word may be used as a substantive, \"Jesus, our Deliverer.\" From the wrath; or righteous indignation of God; here punishment as the effect of wrath. \"The wrath of God is, in its deepest ground, love; love itself becomes a consuming fire to whatever is opposed to the nature of goodness\" (Koch). To come; literally, which is coming, the coming wrath, denoting its absolute certainty. This coming wrath will take place at the advent of Christ, when he appears, not only for the salvation of his people, but for the destruction of his enemies.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Thess.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - For yourselves, brethren; in contrast to other persons. Not only do strangers report the power and efficacy of our preaching among you, but you yourselves arc experimentally acquainted with it. Know our entrance in unto you; referring, not merely to the mere preaching of the gospel to the Thessalonians, but to the entrance which the gospel found into their hearts - to its coming, not in word only, but also in power (1 Thessalonians 1:5). That it was not in vain; not empty, useless, to no purpose, - descriptive of the character of the apostolic entrance among them. Our entrance among you was not powerless, unreal; on the contrary, it was mighty, energetic, powerful. The reference is chiefly to the manner or mode in which Paul and his companions preached the gospel, though not entirely excluding the success of the gospel among the Thessalonians (comp. l Corinthians 15:14, \"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain\").NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - But even after we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated. As the word here rendered \"suffered before\" does not in itself imply that the sufferings were unjust, the apostle adds, \"and were shamefully entreated.\" As ye know, at Philippi. We are informed, in the Acts of the Apostles, that Paul and Silas were publicly scourged and cast into prison; and scourging with rods was regarded as an ignominious punishment, and therefore was forbidden to be inflicted on Roman citizens, such as Paul and Silas were. \"They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison\" (Acts 16:37). We were bold in our God to speak unto you. The word here rendered \"bold\" denotes boldness or freedom of speech; and hence some render the clause, \"We were bold of speech in our God, so as to speak unto you\" (Ellicott). Perhaps, however, as the verb \"to speak\" follows, it is better to render the clause,\" We were confident in our God to speak;\" or \"emboldened to speak\" (R.V., \"we waxed bold\"). This boldness or confidence was in our God, that is, on account of our fellowship or union with him. The gospel of God. The genitive of origin, denoting, not merely that God was the Object, but that he was the Author of the gospel. With much contention; or, in much conflict (R.V.), alluding to the peril and danger with which Paul preached the gospel in Thessalonica.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For our exhortation. This word has a twofold signification, denoting both \"exhortation\" and \"consolation;\" when it refers to the moral conduct it denotes exhortation, but when it is an address to a sufferer it denotes consolation. In the gospel these two meanings are blended together. Was not of deceit. Not in the sense of guile, which would be tantological, but simply \"error,\" without any direct evil intent; our gospel was not a delusion - we were not ourselves deceived. Nor of uncleanness; a word usually employed to denote sensuality, and in this sense the meaning is - We did not, like the heathen in their worship, give occasion to unclean practices: \"We have corrupted no man\" (2 Corinthians 7:2). The word, however, may be taken in a more general sense, as denoting impurity of disposition, impure motives: such as the impure desire of applause or of gain, to which the apostle afterwards alludes. Or of guile. As we were not ourselves deceived, so neither did we attempt to deceive others. The apostle did not adapt his religion, an. Mahomet, to suit the prejudices or passions of men; he did not employ any seductive or temporizing arts; but he boldly went in the face of the prevailing religions of the age, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But; in contrast. As; according as. We were allowed. The old English for \"approved.\" Of God. The word rendered \"allowed\" signifies tried, tested as gold is tested in the fire, and hence also the result of that trial, \"approved.\" As we were esteemed worthy to be put in trust with the gospel; entrusted with its publication. Even so; in this condition of approval and trust. We speak, not as pleasing men, but God, that trieth. The same verb that is rendered \"allowed\" in the first part of the verse; hence \"proverb,\" or \"approveth.\" Our hearts. Not a general statement, \"God who is the Discerner of the heart;\" but \"our hearts,\" namely, of us, the publishers of the gospel - Paul and Silas and Timothy; thus appealing to God, as the infallible Judge of their sincerity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For; confirming the statement that the preachers of the gospel did not seek to please men, but God. Neither at any time used we flattering words; endeavoring to gain you by flattery and praise; we did not pander to your feelings; we did not soften the demands of the gospel. As ye know, nor a cloak - or pretext - of covetousness. We did not use the gospel as a pretext to mask our real motive, which was covetousness, pretending to seek your spiritual good, whereas in reality we sought our own advantage. Paul could with perfect confidence appeal to his converts, and say, \"I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel\" (Acts 20:33). He was free from all sinister motives. \"He did not use words such as flattery uses, or pretexts such as covetousness\" (Jowett). God is witness. Paul appeals to the Thessalonians themselves that he had not used flattering words; so now he appeals to God that the motive of his conduct was not covetousness. Men can judge the external conduct, they can hear the flattering words; but God only can know the motive of action - he only can discern the covetousness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Nor of (or, from) men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome. These words admit of two meanings. The apostle may refer to his refusal to seek maintenance from the Thessalonians, and in this sense become a burden to them. But such a meaning does not suit the context; and besides: this refusal of maintenance is afterwards alluded to by the apostle. The reference here is not to maintenance, but to glory: we did not seek glory from you, when we might have been burdensome, when we might have done so. Hence the word is to be taken in the sense of honor, importance; when we might have claimed honor. As - in virtue of our character as - the apostles of Christ. Paul does not speak of himself alone, but he includes Silas and Timothy, and therefore the word \"apostles\" is to be taken, not in its restricted, but in its wider meaning.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - But. The apostle now describes iris conduct positively. We were gentle; a word used of the amiable conduct of a superior toward an inferior, as of a master toward a servant, a prince toward his subjects, or a father toward his children. \"The servant of God must not strive, but be gentle toward all men\" (2 Timothy 2:24). Some manuscripts read, \"We were babes among you\" - the difference being only the addition of another letter. Among you; in our intercourse with you. Even as a nurse; or rather, a nursing mother, for the children arc her own. Cherisheth; the word employed for birds warming and cherishing their young. Her children. A stronger expression of tenderness and love could hardly be made. Even as a nursing mother dedicates her life for her infant; so, says Paul, we are willing to dedicate ourselves for you. Some important manuscripts read the verse thus: \"But we were babes among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children;\" but this arises from an obvious error of the transcriber.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - So being affectionately desirous of you; a strong expression in the original: \"being filled with earnest love for you.\" We were willing. The word denotes a predetermination of the will: \"we esteemed it good.\" To have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls. An evident climax: not only were we willing to preach the gospel of God to you, but more than this, to sacrifice our own lives for your advantage. The word here rendered \"souls\" denotes lives; and the meaning is that the apostle was willing to submit to death for the sake of the Thessalonians. The plural \"we\" still implies Paul and Silas and Timothy. The thought is - As a nursing mother not only nourishes tier children, but is also ready to sacrifice her life for them; so the apostle not only nourished his spiritual children with the pure milk of the gospel, but was ready to sacrifice his own life for their spiritual maintenance; thus expressing in the strongest manner the womanly tenderness of the apostle toward his converts. Because ye were dear unto us.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For; a proof or confirmation of this dearness of the Thessalonians to the apostle. Ye remember, brethren; recalling to their recollection his conduct when he was with them. Our labor and travail. These two terms frequently occur together (2 Corinthians 11:27; 2 Thessalonians 3:8), and can hardly be distinguished; \"labor,\" or\" toil,\" is active, denoting exertion; \"travail\" is passive, denoting weariness or fatigue, the effect of the exertion. For laboring; in its strict meaning chiefly used of manual labor. Paul here refers to his working for his own support as a tent-maker. Night and day. Night precedes according to the Jewish mode of reckoning. It does not denote that the apostle made up by labor at night the loss of time during the day which his higher duties, as a preacher of the gospel, occasioned; that he wrought at his trade at night, and preached during the (lay; but the phrase, \"night and day,\" denotes incessantly, continually. Because we would not be chargeable to any of you. Not a proof of the poverty of the Church of Thessalonica; but the reason of this unselfish conduct of the apostle was that no hindrance should arise on his part to the spread of the gospel; that no imputation of selfishness or covetousness should be laid to his charge. As he had done at Thessalonica so the apostle acted in other places. Thus at the time he was writing this Epistle he was working for his support at Corinth (1 Corinthians 4:12; 2 Corinthians 11:9). And such was also his practice at Ephesus; for in his farewell address to the Ephesian elders he could appeal to them: \"Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me\" (Acts 20:34). We preached unto you the gospel of God. Thus freely, without charge.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Ye are witnesses, and God also; ye of the outward conduct, and God of the motives which actuated us. How holily and justly and unblamably; \"holily\" denoting the apostle's conduct to God, \"justly\" his conduct to man, and \"unblamably\" the negative side of both particulars. We behaved ourselves among you that believe. The apostle here refers to his own personal demeanor and to that of Silas and Timothy among them, in order that the Thessalonians might realize the purity of their conduct, and so might continue steadfast in their attachment to the gospel which they taught, He men-lions specially \"them that believe,\" not that He acted otherwise among those that did not believe, but because believers were cognizant of his conduct.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children. The translation of this verse is somewhat faulty; it ought to be, as in the R.V., as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying. Paul here changes the image from that of a nursing mother to that of a father; because then he was speaking of his tender care for his converts, whereas here he speaks of the instructions and admonitions which he gave them; as a mother he nourished their spiritual life, and as a father he superintended their spiritual education. \"Exhorting and comforting and charging;\" representing three modes of the apostle's instructions: \"exhorting\" denotes also encouraging and consoling; \"comforting\" denotes supporting and sustaining (\"Comfort the feeble minded,\" 1 Thessalonians 5:14); and \"charging\" denotes testifying or protesting - a solemn pressing home of the exhortation to the hearers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - That (or, to the end that) ye would walk worthy of God; so as to adorn the gospel of God. So in the Epistle to the Colossians: \"That ye would walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing\" (Colossians 1:10). Who hath called you; or, as the best attested manuscripts read, who calleth you. To his kingdom and glory. Not to be weakened as if it were a Hebraism for \"his glorious kingdom,\" or \"the kingdom of his glory;\" but the kingdom and glory are to be viewed as two different objects. \"God called you to Ms kingdom,\" namely, the Messianic kingdom which he has established on earth; and which will be completely realized at the advent. And \"God called you to his glory,\" namely, the glory which is in reserve for all the members of his kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - For this cause. Not because God has called you to his kingdom and glory, but, referring to what follows, because of your reception of' the gospel. We thank God. Although the reception of the gospel was in one sense the free and voluntary act on the part of the Thessalonians; yet in another sense it was the act of God who ordained them to accept the gospel; their belief was an operation of God in them. Without ceasing, because, when ye received the Word of God which ye heard of us; literally, because when ye receive, d from us the Word of hearing, which is of God. The gospel is called \"the Word of hearing,\" because it came by hearing; hence \"the Word heard,\" or \"the Word of the message\" (R.V.). It is further designated \"of God\" - the Word whose Author is God. Ye received it not as the word of men - as if it were of human origin - but as it is in truth, the Word of God - of Divine origin - which effectually worketh. The pronoun may refer to God, \"who effectually worketh,\" or better to the Word of God, as the principal subject of the sentence. Also in you that believe. The gospel was powerful as respects the preachers, and effectual as respects the hearers.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For ye, brethren, became followers; or rather, imitators, namely, in the endurance of suffering for the sake of the gospel, not in intention only, but in reality. Of the Churches Of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus. These Churches arc mentioned as being at this early period the most prominent. The special mention of persecution by the Jews has its origin in the fact that it was by the unbelieving Jews that Paul was persecuted at Thessalonica. For ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen. One of the proofs that the Church of Thessalonica was Gentile in its origin; as these countrymen were evidently Gentiles, being here distinguished from the Jews. From this it would seem that, after Paul and his companions had left Thessalonica, the persecution which arose against the Christians continued, and the Gentiles combined with the Jews in opposing the gospel. Even as they - the Churches of God in Judaea - have of the Jews. We learn from the Acts of the Apostles that the Jewish Christians in Judaea were exposed to severe persecution from their unbelieving countrymen: Stephen was put to death, and Paul himself, in his unconverted state, was a chief among the persecutors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - Who both killed the Lord Jesus; emphatic, to point out the greatness of their wickedness. And their own prophets; or, as some manuscripts read, and the prophets. This crime was often laid to the charge of the Jews: thus, by our Lord, \"Ye are witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets\" (Matthew 23:31); and by the protomartyr Stephen, \"Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?\" (Acts 7:25.) And have persecuted us; literally, driven us out, as Paul and Silos were expelled from Thessalonica. And they please not God, but are contrary to all men. The hatred and contempt which the Jews bore to other nations is noticed by Tacitus, Juvenal, and other heathen writers. Thus Tacitus writes of them: \"They are faithful to obstinacy, and merciful toward themselves, but toward all others are actuated by the most irreconcilable hatred (odium humani generis).\" And Juvenal says, \"They will not show the road to one who was not of their religion, nor lead the thirsty person if uncircumcised to the common spring.\" Perhaps, however, the apostle refers here, not to the enmity of the Jews to the human race in general, though perfectly cognizant of their bigotry and intolerance; as this enmity was a perversion of their peculiar distinction as he people of God; but rather to their opposition to his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles - to their extreme reluctance that the Gentiles along with themselves should be admitted into the kingdom of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTForbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Forbidding us - by contradicting, blaspheming, slandering, laying snares - to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved. Not that the Jews were averse to the proselytism of the Gentiles, provided they were circumcised -rod kept the Law of Moses; on the contrary, Judaism at this period was a proselytizing religion; but their great objection to the preaching of the gospel was that the preachers did not insist on the Gentiles becoming Jews before they became Christians. And, accordingly, we learn from the Acts of the Apostles that the unbelieving Jews were the most violent and implacable enemies of the gospel. Of the numerous persecutions mentioned in the Acts, there were only two, namely, those at Philippi and Ephesus, which were not occasioned by the Jews. To fill up their sins always; so that the measure of their iniquity became full to overflowing. Their forbidding the apostles to preach to the Gentiles was the last drop which caused the cup of their iniquity to overflow (cutup. Genesis 15:16, \"The iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full\"). The remark of Professor Jowett is well worthy of notice: \"In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents, and had the power of going on or of retreating. But as the crisis of their fate approaches, they are bound under a curse and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds is as though it were certain, and only a question of time how soon it is to be fulfilled.\" For the wrath; that wrath which was predicted and is merited by them. \"Wrath\" is here used for punishment, which is the effect of wrath. Is come upon them to the uttermost; literally, to the end. The apostle here refers to the judgments of God, which were impending on Jerusalem and the Jewish people; judgments which were fearfully executed in the awful sufferings they endured in the Jewish war, and in the destruction of their city by the Romans.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Here a new chapter ought to have commenced, passing on to another subject, the apostle's desire to visit the Thessalonians. But we, brethren, being taken from you; literally, being bereaved of you (R.V.). For a short time; literally, for the space of an hour. And yet it was several years before the apostle revisited Thessalonica; but he here speaks of the short period - a space of six months - which had already separated them; not, as some suppose, that his mind was so full of the ideas of eternity that he overlooked all divisions of time. In presence, not in heart. Similar expressions are common in Paul's Epistles, denoting his love for his converts; thus: \"Though I be absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit\" (Colossians 2:5). Endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire; because our separation has been so short. As has been well observed, \"Universal experience testifies that the pain of separation from friends and the desire to return to them are more vivid, the more freshly the remembrance of the departure is on the mind\" (Lunemann).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul. Paul distinguishes himself, because in all probability his companions, Silas and Timothy, had been at Thessalonica after he had left it. Once and again. Not used indefinitely, but referring to two separate attempts which Paul made to revisit the Thessalonians. But Satan hindered us; denoting, not the enemies of Christianity, but the devil, the author of all the hindrances in the kingdom of God. Paul here recognizes the personality of Satan, as the author of all evil, the great opponent of God and Christ. We are not informed by what instrumentality this hindrance of Satan took place. It may refer to the various persecutions against Paul, which prevented him returning to Thessalonica, and especially to that persecution raised against him in Beraea by the Jews of Thessalonica (Acts 17:13). In one sense, indeed, the hindrances arose in the way of God's providence, for under its direction all the journeys of Paul were placed, and Satan could not have hindered him from preaching the gospel in any quarter, unless by the Divine permission (comp. Acts 16:7; Romans 1:13).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? or, glorying. The apostle calls the Thessalonians his \"hope,\" not because he anticipates any reward from their conversion, or because their conversion would counterbalance his former persecution of the Christians, but because he hoped to meet them in glory; he calls them his \"joy,\" because he would rejoice with them in their final salvation; and he calls them his \"crown of rejoicing,\" because he regards them as trophies of the victory of the gospel which he preached. Similarly he calls the Philippians \"his joy and crown\" (Philippians 4:1). Are not even ye; or rather, are not ye also? - ye as well as other Christians? In the presence of - before - our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming; at the restoration of his Messianic kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians2:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye are our glory and joy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - For ye are our glory and joy. Some refer this verse to the present, and the former verse to the future; not merely at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but even now ye are our glory and joy. But there is no reason for this distinction; the words are merely confirmatory, and added from the fullness of the apostle's emotions.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Thess.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This verse is closely connected with the concluding verses of the last chapter, from which it should not be separated. Wherefore; on account of my affection toward you and my repeated vain attempts to see you. When we. Some refer the plural to Paul, Silas, and Timothy (1 Thessalonians 1:1); others to Paul and Silas, as Timothy had been sent to Thessalonica; but it is to be restricted to Paul, as is evident from 1 Thessalonians 2:38 and 1 Thessalonians 3:5, and inasmuch as Paul was left alone at Athens; the plural being here used for the singular. Could no longer forbear; could no longer restrain our longing and anxiety to know your condition. We thought it good; a happy translation of the original, expressing both \"we were pleased and resolved.\" To be left at Athens alone; an expression of solitude. Alone in Athens, in the very metropolis of idolatry. Compare with this the common saying, \"Alone in London.\" In the Acts of the Apostles we are informed that Paul came to Athens alone, and that there he waited for Silas and Timothy (Acts 17:14, ]5), and that these fellow-workers rejoined him at Corinth (Acts 18:5). Many expositors, however, from this and the next verse, infer that Timothy at least joined Paul at Athens, but was sent back by him to Thessalonica, to inquire into the condition of his converts in that city. Such is the opinion of Olshausen, Neander, De Wette, Lunemann, Hofmann, Koch, and Schott; and, among English expositors, of Macknight, Paley, Eadie, Jowett, Ellicott, and Wordsworth. There is no contradiction between this view and the narrative of the Acts. Luke merely omits to mention Timothy's short visit to Athens and departure from it, and relates only the final reunion of these three fellow-workers at Corinth. Indeed, Paley gives this coming of Timothy to Athens as one of the undesigned coincidences between this Epistle and the Acts of the Apostles. Still, however, we are not necessitated to suppose that Timothy joined the apostle at Athens. The words admit of the opinion that he was sent by Paul direct from Beraea, and not from Athens; and that he and Silas did not join Paul until they came from Macedonia to Corinth. Such is the opinion of Hug, Wieseler, Koppe, Alford, and Vaughan.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And sent Timotheus. This was a great act of self-sacrifice on the part of Paul; because to be without an assistant and fellow-laborer in the gospel in such a city as Athens, the very center and strong hold of heathenism, full of temples and idols, must necessarily have brought upon him many discomforts; and yet his anxiety for the Thessalonians overcame all motives of personal convenience. Our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow-laborer. The reading of manuscripts here varies. Some important manuscripts read, \"our brother and fellow-worker with God\" - a phrase which is elsewhere employed by the apostle: \"for we are laborers together with God\" (1 Corinthians 3:9). Retaining, however, the reading of the text, Paul here calls Timothy his brothel expressing his esteem and fraternal affection for him; \"a minister of God,\" expressing Timothy's official position and the honor conferred on him by Christ; and his \"fellow-laborer,\" expressing his laborious work in preaching the gospel, and reminding the Thessalonians of his labors among them. Different reasons have been assigned for this eulogy pronounced by Paul on Timothy. Some suppose that it was to show how eagerly he consulted the welfare of the Thessalonians, by sending to them a person of such importance and of such use to himself as Timothy (Calvin); others think that it was to recommend Timothy to the favorable regard of the Thessalonians in the absence of himself (Chrysostom); but it appears to be the natural outburst of affection for his favorite disciple. In the gospel of Christ. Timothy had labored with Paul and Silas in the publication of the gospel at Thessalonica, and was consequently well known to the Thessalonians, and favorably regarded by them. To establish you, and to comfort you; or rather, to exhort you, as the matter of exhortation follows. Concerning your faith; in order to the continuance and furtherance of your faith. The purpose of the mission of Timothy; namely, to confirm the Thessalonians in the faith, to exhort them to perseverance in Christianity, notwithstanding the persecutions to which they were exposed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This verse contains the object of the exhortation; the clause is an accusative to the verb. That no man should be moved (or, shaken) by; or rather in; expressing the position in which they were placed. These afflictions. The same word as \"tribulation\" in the next verse. For yourselves know. How they knew is explained, partly from the forewarnings of the apostle, and partly from their own experience. That we; not to be referred to Paul only, nor to Paul and his companions, Silas and Timothy, nor to Paul and the Thessalonians, but to all Christians in general; that we Christians. Are appointed thereunto; namely, by God. Our afflictions do not result from chance, but are the necessary consequence of our Christianity; they arise from the appointment and ordinance of God. Tribulation is the Christian's portion. Whatever truth there may be in the saying that prosperity is the promise of the Old Testament, affliction is certainly the promise of the New. We must be conformed to Christ in his sufferings. \"In the world,\" says our Lord, \"ye shall have tribulation\" (John 16:33). When our Lord called Paul to his apostleship, he showed him how great things he must suffer for his Name's sake (Acts 9:16). All the apostles suffered from persecution, and concerning Christians in general Paul asserts that it is only through tribulation that they can enter into the kingdom of God (Acts 14:22; see Revelation 7:14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - For; assigning the reason why they should not be moved by these afflictions. Verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we; here also Christians in general. Should suffer. Not a simple future, but denoting that it was thus appointed in the counsels of God - that their tribulation was the result of the Divine purpose. Tribulation (affliction); even as it came to pass, and ye know; that is, from your own experience. The affliction, then, was not some strange thing which had befallen them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - For this cause, when I could no longer forbear; no longer repress my anxiety, and endure my want of information concerning you. I sent to know your faith; to receive information concerning your spiritual condition. Lest by some means the tempter; a designation of Satan, used also by Matthew 4:3. Have tempted you, and our labor be in vain; that is, useless, without result (see on 1 Thessalonians 2:1; comp. also Galatians 4:11, \"I am afraid, lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain\"). The temptation to which the Thessalonians were exposed was that of apostasy from Christianity, through the fear or endurance of persecution. That the tempter had tempted them is probable - it was almost unavoidable; that he had succeeded in his temptation, and had thus rendered the apostle's labors among them useless, was uncertain - a contingency which might possibly have taken place.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - But now when Timotheus came from you unto us. Timothy, as we learn from the Acts, in company with Silas, joined Paul at Corinth (Acts 18:15), and brought him information concerning the state of the Thessalonian Church. And brought us good tidings; the same word which is elsewhere employed for preaching the gospel. The information which Timothy brought to the apostle was as it were a gospel to him (comp. Luke 2:10, \"Behold I bring you good tidings\"). Of your faith and charity. The good tidings which Timothy brought referred to the spiritual condition of the Thessalonians - their faith had not been shaken and their love had not waxed cold under the persecutions to which they were exposed; and along with their faith and love was the affection which they bore to the apostle, and their earnest desire to see him. And that ye have constant remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you. The affection between the Thessalonians and the apostle was mutual.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you - with reference to you - in all our affliction and distress. Some refer \"affliction\" to outward troubles, and \"distress\" to internal evils - referring the one to the persecutions arising from his Corinthian opponents, and the other to his bodily infirmity (Koch). Such a distinction is, however, precarious. The words do not refer to the apostle's anxiety on account of the Thessalonians, for that was removed by the coming of Timothy. Clearly some external trouble is denoted. Paul, when he preached the gospel at Corinth, and before he obtained the protection of Gallio, was exposed to much persecution and danger. The Jews had expelled him from their synagogue (Acts 18:6), and attempts had been made against him which at length broke out into an insurrection against him, when he was dragged before the Roman tribunal (Acts 18:12). His condition at Corinth when he wrote this Epistle was dark and gloomy. By your faith; by the steadfastness of your faith. The good news which Timothy brought of the faith and love of the Thessalonians comforted the apostle amid all the trials and difficulties and disappointments of his ministry (comp. with this passage 2 Corinthians 7:4-7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - For now we live. Not to be referred to the eternal and future life (Chrysostom); or to be weakened as if it merely signified, \"We relish and enjoy life notwithstanding our affliction and distress\" (Pelt); but the meaning is the good tidings which Timothy has brought have imparted new life unto us; \"we are in the full strength and freshness of life, we do not feel the sorrows and tribulations which the outer world prepares for us\" (Lunemann). The apostle considers his condition of affliction and distress as a kind of death: so, elsewhere he says, \"I die daily\" (1 Corinthians 15:31); and from which death he was now again raised to life. If; provided - a hypothetical assumption. Ye stand fast; continue firm in the faith of the gospel. In the Lord; the element of true life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For; assigning the reason of the declaration, \"now we live.\" What thanks can we render to God again for you. As their steadfastness in the faith was owing to God's grace, thanks was to be rendered to God on their behalf. For all the joy; joy in all its fullness (comp. James 1:2, \"Count it all joy\"). Wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God. Giving prominence to the purity of their joy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNight and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Night and day (comp. 1 Thessalonians 2:9) praying exceedingly. Denoting the intense earnestness and anxiety of the apostle for the spiritual welfare of the Thessalonians, that found vent to itself in incessant prayer for them. Now follows the subject-matter of his prayer. That we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith. The faith of the Thessalonians was not perfect; it was \"lacking\" in several respects. It was defective in extent; they were ignorant of many of the doctrines of the gospel, and had formed erroneous views of other doctrines, such as the second advent. It was defective in application; they had not yet renounced all the corrupt practices of their former heathen life, nor had they embodied all the precepts of the gospel into their actual life. The Thessalonians were as yet but novices. So also the reason which impelled Paul to wish to come to Rome was to supply that which was lacking in the faith of the Roman converts (Romans 1:11). Confirmation was a work in which the apostle delighted, being both important and desirable. In general, faith at first is weak and defective; it is only developed by degrees. Especially is it increased by every increase of spiritual knowledge. \"Add to your faith knowledge\" (2 Peter 1:5, 6). The remark of Calvin is worthy of attention: \"Paul is desirous of having the opportunity given him of supplying what is wanting in the faith of the Thessalonians, or, which is the same thing, completing in all its parts their faith which was as yet imperfect. Yet this is the faith which he had previously extolled marvelously. From this we infer that those who far surpass others are still far distant from the goal. Hence, whatever progress we may have made, let us keep in view our deficiencies, that we may not be reluctant to aim at something further.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Now God himself and our Father; or, as we would express it according to the English idiom, God himself, our Father, omitting the conjunction. And our Lord Jesus Christ. Some suppose that the three Divine Persons of the sacred Trinity are here expressly named: God the Holy Ghost, and the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ; but the words in the original will not bear this sense: \"God himself and our Father\" is the same Divine Person. Direct. It is to be observed that the verb \"direct\" is in the Greek in the singular, thus denoting a unity between God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. At all events, we have an express prayer directed to Christ, thus necessarily implying his Divine nature. Our way unto you.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians3:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - And the Lord.

Make you; literally, you may the Lord make, putting the emphasis on\" you.\" To increase and abound in love one toward another; toward your fellow-Christians. And toward all men; toward the human race in general. \"This is the character of Divine love to comprehend all; whereas human love hath respect to one man and not to another\" (Theophylact).

With all his saints. By \"saints\" or \"holy ones\" are by some understood the angels who shall accompany Christ to judgment; but although the term \"saints\" is used of the angels in the Old Testament, it is never so employed in the New.

Then; or rather, therefore; connecting this exhortation with the closing verses of the last chapter: In order that you may be established un-blamably in holiness at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, you must do your part, you must earnestly strive after holiness.

How ye ought to walk and to please God; how you ought to conduct yourselves so as to please God. The walking was the means of pleasing. The R.V., after these words, on the authority of manuscripts, adds, \"even as ye do walk.\" So ye would abound more and more. The apostle acknowledges their Christian walking; they had already entered upon the road; their conduct was sanctified; but he exhorts them to abound therein with still greater care and fidelity.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For ye know; appealing to their memory in confirmation of what he had said.

It is in this latter sense that the word is here employed. Even your sanctification; complete consecration; holiness taken in its most general so. use. Our holiness is the great design of Christ's death, and is the revealed will of God. Some (Olshausen, Lunemann) restrict the term to moral purity, and consider the next clause as its explanation (comp. Romans 12:1). That ye should abstain from fornication; a vice fearfully prevalent among the heathen, and which, indeed, they hardly regarded as wrong. Especially it was the great sin of Corinth, from which the apostle wrote, the patron goddess of which city was Venus.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - That every one of you should know how to possess. The word here rendered \"possess\" rather signifies \"acquire.\" The R.V. renders the clause, \"that each one of you know how to possess himself of;\" hence it admits of the translation, \"to obtain the mastery over.\" His vessel. This word has given rise to a diversity of interpretation. Especially two meanings have been given to it. By some it is supposed to be a figurative expression for \"wife,\" in which sense the word is used, though rarely, by Hebrew writers. Peter speaks of the wife \"as the weaker vessel\" (1 Peter 3:7). This is the meaning adopted by Augustine, Schott, Do Wette, Koch, Hofmann, Lünemann, Riggenbach; and, among English expositors, by Alford, Jowett, Ellicott, and Eadie. This meaning is, however, to be rejected as unusual and strange, and unsuitable to what follows in the next verse. The other meaning - \"one's own body\" - is more appropriate. Thus Paul says, \"We have this treasure,\" namely, the gospel, \"in earthen vessels\" (2 Corinthians 4:7; comp. also 1 Samuel 21:5). The body may well be compared to a vessel, as it contains the soul. This meaning is adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Grotius, Bengel, Olshausen, Meyer; and, among English expositors, by Macknight, Conybeare, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Yaughan. In sanctification and honor. What the apostle here requires is that every one should obtain the mastery over his own body, and that whereas, as Gentiles, they had yielded their members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, they should now, as Christians, yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness (Romans 6:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNot in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Not in the lust of concupiscence - not in the passion of lust (R.V.) - even as the Gentiles which know not God; and therefore from whom nothing better was to be expected. The moral sense of the heathen was so perverted, and their natures so corrupt, that they looked upon fornication as a thing indifferent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - That no man go beyond; or, transgress. And defraud; or, as it is in the margin of our Bibles, oppress, or, overreach; wrong (R.V.). His brother. Not an exhortation against dishonesty, or prohibition against all attempts to overreach in usual mutual intercourse, as the words would at first sight seem to imply, and as some consider it (Hofmann, Lunemann, Riggenbach); but, as is evident from the context, a continuation of the former exhortation, a prohibition against impurity. In any matter; or, more properly, in the matter, namely, that about which I have been discoursing. \"An example of the modest reserve and refined delicacy which characterize the holy apostle's language in speaking of things which the Gentiles did without shame, and thus, by a chaste bashfulness of words, commending the duty of unblemished purity in deeds\" (Wordsworth). Because the Lord is the Avenger of all such; either of all such as are thus defrauded or of all such sinful practices. As we also have forewarned you and testified.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For God hath not called us unto; or, for the purpose cf. Uncleanness; moral uncleanness in general (comp. 1 Corinthians 6:15). But unto; or, in; in a state of Holiness; or sanctification; the same word as in the third verse; so that holiness is the whole sphere of cur Christian life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHe therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - He therefore that despiseth; or, as it is in the margin, rejecteth (R.V.). What is rejected is either the above commands to moral purity, or the Christian calling to holiness, or, better still, Paul himself, as the organ of God. Despiseth; or, rejecteth. Not man; that is, not me, as if the commands were given from myself - were of mere human origin. But God; the Giver of these commands. So also Peter said unto Ananias, \"Thou hast not lied unto man, but unto God\" (Acts 5:4); and our Lord says, \"He that rejecteth you rejecteth me\" (Luke 10:16). Who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit. If this is the correct reading, then the apostle here again asserts his own inspiration, and that in the strongest and plainest terms. The best manuscripts, however, read, \"who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you\" (R.V.) - a strong enforcement of holiness, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit was given them for the express purpose of producing holiness within them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - The apostle now proceeds to a new exhortation. But as touching brotherly love. Brotherly love is the love of Christians to Christians, that special affection which believers bear to each other; a virtue which was carried to such perfection in the primitive Church as to call forth the admiration of their heathen adversaries. This virtue is often inculcated in Scripture (Hebrews 13:1; 1 John 3:14), and is distinguished from love in general (2 Peter 1:7). Ye need not that I write unto you; a delicate and gentle reproof. For ye yourselves are taught of God. We are not here to think of the new commandment of brotherly love given by the Savior, nor on the Divine compassion exciting us to love; but \"taught of God\" by the influences of the Spirit on their hearts and consciences to love one another.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia. Not only to those in Thessalonica, but to all believers in your country and neighborhood. But we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; that ye make progress in brotherly love - that it increase in purity, in warmth, and in extent.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - And that ye study; literally, that ye be ambitious. To be quiet; to avoid unrest, to live in peace. Worldly ambition excludes quietness and prompts to restlessness; so that the apostle's admonition really is, \"that ye be ambitious not to be ambitious.\" The unrest which disturbed the peace of the Thessalonian Church was not political, but religions; it arose from the excitement naturally occasioned by the entrance of the new feeling of Christianity among them. It would also appear that they were excited by the idea of Christ's immediate advent. This had occasioned disorders, and had caused several to neglect their ordinary business and to give themselves over to an indolent inactivity, so that Christian prudence was overborne (comp. 2 Thessalonians 3:6-12). Perhaps, also, the liberality of the richer members of the Church was abused and perverted, so as to promote indolence. And to do your own business; to attend to the duties of your worldly calling, to avoid idleness. And to work with your own hands. From this it would appear that the members of the Thessalonian Church were chiefly composed of the laboring classes. As we commanded you. A precisely similar exhortation is given in the Epistle to the Ephesians: \"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good\" (Ephesians 4:28).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThat ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - That ye walk honestly; that is, honorably; seemly. Toward them that are without; without the pale of the Christian Church, toward those who are not Christians, whether Jews or Gentiles, the unbelieving world. So also, in another Epistle, the apostle says, \"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without\" (Colossians 4:5). That ye may have lack of nothing; either neuter, of no thing; or perhaps rather masculine, of no man; that ye be under no necessity of asking assistance either from heathens or from fellow-Christians; inasmuch as working with your hands will put you in possession of what is necessary for life; whereas idleness necessarily involves poverty and dependence on others.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - With this verse the apostle proceeds to another subject, namely, to comfort those who were mourning the death of their friends. It would appear that the Thessalonians were in perplexity and distress concerning the fate of their deceased friends, fearing that these would miss those blessings which they expected Christ to confer at his advent. Their views of the time and nature of the advent and of the future state in general were confused. They expected that Christ would come immediately and establish his kingdom on earth; and consequently they feared that those who had died would be excluded from it. But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren; a phrase often used by the apostle, when he makes a transition to new and important matters (comp. Romans 1:13; Romans 11:25; 1 Corinthians 10:1; 1 Corinthians 12:1; 2 Corinthians 1:8). Concerning them which are asleep; or, are fallen asleep. The death of believers in the New Testament is frequently called \"sleep.\" \"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth\" (John 11:11). Of Stephen it is said that \"he fell asleep\" (Acts 7:60). \"Many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep\" (1 Corinthians 11:30). \"Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished\" (1 Corinthians 15:18). \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed\" (l Corinthians 15:51). \"He fell asleep\" is a common epitaph on early Christian tombstones. It is to be observed that it is not of the dead generally that the apostle speaks, but of the dead in Christ, and especially of those members of the Thessalonian Church who had died. That ye sorrow not. Some suppose that sorrow for our deceased friends is here utterly prohibited; inasmuch as if we had a firm belief in their blessedness we would rejoice and not mourn. But the sorrow here prohibited is a despairing and an unbelieving sorrow; we are forbidden to sorrow as those who have no hope, no belief in a blessed resurrection. The tears of Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus have authorized and sanctified Christian sorrow. \"Paul,\" observes Calvin, \"lifts up the minds of believers to a consideration of the resurrection, lest they should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death of their relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief, for this reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction. Those that abuse this testimony so as to establish among Christians stoical indifference, that is, an iron hardness, will find nothing of this nature in Paul's words.\" Even as others; literally, as the rest; namely, the heathen. Which have no hope; no hope of immortality beyond death, or no hope of the resurrection. The heathen, with very few exceptions, had no hope of a future life, and hence they mourned over the death of their friends as an irreparable loss. This disconsolate feeling is apparent in their writings (for examples, see Lunemann, Alford, and Jowett, in loco).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again. The apostle's argument proceeds on the supposition that Christ and believers are one body, of which Christ is the Head and believers are the members; and that consequently what happens to the Head must happen to the members. Our knowledge and belief of a future state, and especially of the resurrection, is founded on the resurrection of Christ (comp. 1 Corinthians 15:12-20). Even so them also which sleep in Jesus; or more literally, through Jesus. Will God bring with him; namely, with Jesus. These words are differently construed. Some read them thus: \"Even so them also which sleep will God through Jesus bring with him\" (De Wette, Lunemann); but this appears to be an awkward construction; as we must then render the clause, \"will God through Jesus bring with Jesus.\" It is, therefore, better to refer the words, \"through Jesus,\" to the first clause. It is through Jesus that believers fall asleep; it is he who changes the nature of death, for all his people, from being the king of terrors into a quiet and gentle sleep, from which they will awaken to eternal life.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord; or rather, by a word of the Lord. The apostle does not refer to those portions of the gospel which record our Lord's discourses concerning the last things; nor to some sayings of Christ preserved by tradition; but to a direct revelation made unto himself by the Lord. We know from Scripture that Paul had many such revelations imparted to him (comp. 1 Corinthians 11:23; Galatians 1:11, 12). That we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord. These words are the occasion of an important discussion. It has been affirmed that the apostle here asserts that he himself expected to be alive, with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord's advent; that, according to his expectation, Christ's second coming was close at hand. \"Those who are alive and remain\" are distinguished from \"those who are asleep,\" and in the former class the apostle includes himself and his readers. And a similar declaration is contained in the First Epistle to the Corinthians: \"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed\" (1 Corinthians 15:51). Such is the view adopted by Grotius, Olshausen, Koch, Neander, Lechler, Baur, Winer, Reuse, Lunemann, Riggenbach; and, among English divines, by Alford, Jowett, Stanley, and Conybeare. Some of them suppose that Paul changed his opinion on this point - that whilst in his earlier Epistles he taught the immediateness of the advent, in his later Epistles he renounced this hope and looked forward to his own departure. There does not seem to be any ground for this opinion. On the contrary, it would appear from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, written only a few weeks after this Epistle, that Paul did not expect the advent immediately, but mentions a series of events which would intervene before its occurrence (2 Thessalonians 2:1-3). And in this Epistle he represses the curiosity of the Thessalonians about the precise time of the advent by telling them that it was beyond the sphere of his teaching (1 Thessalonians 5:1, 2). We consider, then, that the apostle speaks here as a member of the Christian body, and uses a very common form of expression - that we Christians which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord; but not at all intending to express his confidence that he himself and his converts would be actually alive at the advent. \"He spake,\" says St. Chrysostom, \"not of himself, but of Christians who would be alive at the day of judgment.\" Such is the view adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Bengel, Hofmann, Lunge, Macknight, Ellicott, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Vaughan. At the same time, it must be remembered that the time of the advent was expressly concealed (Matthew 24:36; Acts 1:7), and that it might occur at any period; and, by reason of their proximity to the first advent, the primitive Christians would be deeply impressed with the possibility or even probability of its occurrence in their days. Christians were to be living always in readiness for this great event, and thus it became a matter of expectation. \"Strictly speaking, the expectation of the day of the Lord was not a belief, but a necessity in the early Church; clinging as it did to the thought of Christ, it could not bear to be separated from him; it was his absence, not his presence, that the first believers found it hard to realize\" (Jowett). Hence Paul might not regard the advent as far removed into the distant future, as wholly impossible to happen in his days, but as an occurrence which might at any time take place; but he did not teach anything definite or certain on the subject. Shall not prevent; go before or anticipate, obtain the preference over, get before, so that those that are asleep might be left behind and fail of the prize. Them that are asleep; those who are dead, so that they, the living, should be glorified before them, or perhaps hinder their glorification.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - For; assigning a reason for the above assertion, \"because.\" The Lord himself; not merely the Lord as the chief Person and Actor on that day, in contrast to his saints, but emphatic, \"the Lord himself,\" the Lord in his own proper Person. Shall descend from heaven; where the crucified and risen Jesus is now enthroned, seated at the right hand of God. With a shout; a word denoting a commanding shout as that of a leader to his host when he leads them into the battle, or of the army when it rushes to the fight. Some refer this shout to what follows - the voice of the archangel and the trump of God; but there are three particulars here mentioned. Others attribute it to Christ himself. With the voice of the archangel; or rather, of an archangel. There is only one archangel mentioned in Scripture (Jude 1:9); the word denotes, not \"chief angel,\" but \"chief or ruler of the angels.\" Accordingly, same suppose that Christ himself is here meant, as to him alone, it is asserted, does this title belong; but the Lord and the archangel are here evidently distinguished. Others strangely imagine that the Holy Ghost is here meant. Others fix on the archangel Michael (Jude 1:9). Christ is represented as accompanied by angels to the judgment; and it is futile to inquire who this leader of the angels is. And the trump of God; even as the trumpet sounded at the giving of the Law from Sinai. Also the advent of Christ to judgment is represented as heralded by the sound of a trumpet (Matthew 24:31; 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52). \"We are to recognize three particulars, following each other in rapid succession - the commanding shout of the King himself, the voice of the archangel summoning the other angels, and the trump of God which awakens the dead and collects believers\" (Riggen-bach). And the dead in Christ shall rise first. Some suppose that the reference here is to the first resurrection; that the righteous, \"the dead in Christ,\" shall rise before the wicked, \"the dead not in Christ;\" and that a thousand years, or the millennium, will intervene between the first and second resurrections (Revelation 20:4, 5). But this is an entirely erroneous supposition. All that is here asserted is that the dead in Christ shall rise before the living in Christ shall be changed; there is no contrast between the dead in Christ and the dead not in Christ, nor any allusion to the resurrection of the wicked.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Then we which are alive and remain; or, are left; that is, the saints who shall then be found alive on the earth. The apostle classes himself among the living, because he was then alive. Shall be caught up. The expression describes the irresistible power with which the saints shall be caught up, perhaps by the ministry of angels. Together with them; with the dead in Christ who are raised. In the clouds. Our Lord is described as coming to judgment in the clouds of heaven (Matthew 24:30; Revelation 1:7). According to the Old Testament representation, God is described as making the clouds his chariot (Psalm 104:3). To meet the Lord; in his descent from heaven to earth. In the air. Not that he shall fix his throne in the air, but that he passes through the air in his descent to the earth. And so shall we ever be with the Lord; shall share a blessed eternity in the vision and participation of his glory. The apostle does not here describe the solemnities of the judgment; but stops at the meeting of Christ and his risen saints, because his object was to comfort the Thessalonians under bereavement.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians4:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore comfort one another with these words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - Wherefore comfort one another with these words; on the ground of that Divine revelation which I have made unto you.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","1Thess.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - This verse is connected with what precedes. The apostle was comforting the Thessalonians under the loss of their deceased friends by the assurance that both the living and the dead would be gathered together at the advent. The question would naturally arise, \"When shall these things be?\" (Luke 21:7); and it would appear that the Thessalonians expected an immediate advent. The apostle represses their curiosity on this point by reminding them of the uncertainty of the time of the Lord's coming. But of the times and the seasons, brethren; that is, of the time and the precise period of the Lord's advent. \"Times\" and \"seasons\" are elsewhere united together (Ecclesiastes 3; Daniel 2:21; Acts 1:7). The word translated \"times\" denotes time absolutely without regard to circumstances; and the word rendered \"seasons\" denotes a definite point of time; not merely the day, but the hour (Mark 13:32). Ye have no need that I write unto you; literally, that ought be written unto you (R.V.); comp. 1 Thessalonians 4:9. The reason why it was not needful for the apostle to write unto them was, not because he regarded the information unprofitable or superfluous, or because he knew it to be impossible, but because he had already informed them when at Thessalonica that the time of the advent was beyond the sphere of his teaching. The apostle mentions this to repress that vain curiosity which is natural to man, and which was the occasion of so much disorder among the Thessalonians. Our duty is, not to pry into the times and seasons which the Father hath put in his own power (Acts 1:7), but to exercise constant watchfulness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For yourselves know perfectly; namely, not from Scripture, nor from oral tradition, but from the teaching of the apostle when in Thessalonica. That the day of the Lord. \"The day of the Lord\" is a common Old Testament expression, denoting the coming of the Divine judgments (Joel 1:15; Joel 2:1); and by the phrase here is meant, not the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the day of one's death, but the day of the Lord's advent, when Christ shall descend from heaven in glory for the resurrection of the dead and the judgment of the world. The idea of judgment is contained in the term \"day.\" So cometh as a thief in the night. The same comparison is used by our Lord himself (Matthew 24:43; Luke 12:39), and the very words are employed by Peter (2 Peter 3:10). The point of resemblance is evidently the unexpectedness and suddenness of the coming. The thief comes upon people in the night season, when they are asleep and unprepared; so, in a similar manner, when Christ comes, he will find the world unprepared and not expecting his advent. The ancient Fathers inferred from this passage that Christ would come to judgment in the night season, and hence they instituted vigils, or night watches. Some, still more precisely, fixed the coming on Easter night, from the analogy of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt on the paschal evening.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - For; the best manuscripts omit this conjunction; the description is continuous. When they shall say; namely, the unbelieving world. Peace and safety; peace denoting internal rest, and safety external security. Sudden destruction cometh upon them. When they thought themselves most secure, they were then in the greatest danger; when they were most off their guard, then the crisis came. As travail upon a woman with child. The primary point of resemblance is certainly the suddenness and unexpectedness of the event; as labor comes upon a woman suddenly, so sudden destruction cometh upon the ungodly world. Still, however, the unavoidableness of the judgment may also be here intimated; there is no possibility of escape: this is implied in the last clause, and they shall not escape.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - But ye, brethren; ye believers, in opposition to the unbelieving world. Are not in darkness; referring back to the night (ver. 2), when the thief comes. By darkness is here meant, not merely ignorance, but moral depravity - the darkness of sin. Ye are not in the ignorant and sinful condition of the unredeemed world, so as to be surprised by the day of the Lord. With you it is not night, but day; the light of the gospel is shining around you; and therefore the day of the Lord's coming will not surprise you in an unprepared state. That; a statement, not of result, but of purpose - \"in order that.\" That day; the day; namely, the day of the Lord. Should overtake you - surprise you - as a thief.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYe are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Ye are all the children of the light, and the children of the day. Hebraistic expressions denoting, Ye all belong to the light and to the day. An affirmation, strengthening the previous declaration. The light and the day are synonymous expressions - the day being the period of light, as opposed to the night and darkness. We are not of the night, nor of darkness; rendering the positive assertion more emphatic.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Therefore; because we are the children of the, light and of the day, because we have been enlightened and purified, we ought to be watchful and sober, so that we may not be unprepared for the day of the Lord. Privileges will avail us nothing, unless we use them and walk up to them. Let us not sleep. Sleep is here evidently used metaphorically to denote religious carelessness. As do others; the unbelieving and ungodly. But let us watch and be sober; evidently to be understood metaphorically of spiritual vigilance and sobriety: watchfulness denoting wakefulness from sleep, and sobriety freedom from intoxication. Both must be combined: we must be watchful, on our guard, and we must be sober, armed and prepared; \"for even by day,\" observes St. Chrysostom, \"if one watches, but is not sober, he will fall into numberless dangers.\" The same exhortation is given by Peter, but in the reverse order: \"Be sober, be vigilant\" (1 Peter 5:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - For; the reason of this exhortation. They that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunken are drunken in the night. Here not to be taken in a metaphorical sense, but a simple statement of fact - what occurs in ordinary experience. The night is the season in which sleep and drunkenness usually occur; whereas the day is the season of watchfulness, sobriety, and work. Both heathen and Jews considered it as eminently disgraceful for a man to be seen drunken in the day-time. Hence, when the Jews accused the believers on the day of Pentecost with being filled with new wine, Peter answered, \"We are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day\" (Acts 2:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - But; contrast to the conduct of those who are of the night: let us not only be watchful, but armed. The apostle now adopts a favorite figure, that of spiritual armor. The arms which he here mentions are only two - the breastplate to protect the heart, and the helmet to guard the head; they are both defensive weapons, because the reference here is not so much to the believer's conflict with evil, as to his defense against surprise. And by these spiritual weapons are denoted the three cardinal graces - faith, love, and hope (1 Thessalonians 1:3). Let us who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love. By \"faith\" is here meant faith in Christ; and by \"love,\" not so much love to God as love to man. These preserve the heart of a Christian against the assaults and influences of evil, as the breastplate guards the heart of the earthly warrior. And for a helmet, the hope of salvation. Salvation in its most comprehensive sense. The hope of salvation sustains our courage amid all the trials of life by holding out to us the prospect of eternal blessedness. Vigilance is of no avail unless armed by faith, hope, and love. In the Epistle to the Ephesians there is a still fuller enumeration of the Christian armor (Ephesians 6:14-18); and there is a slight difference in the description of the weapons. Here the apostle speaks of the breastplate of faith and love; there of the breastplate of righteousness and of the shield of faith. Here the helmet is called the hope of salvation; there the apostle speaks of the helmet of salvation. And besides these defensive weapons, other weapons of defense and the sword, a weapon of offence, are mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For. Not a new reason for watchfulness and sobriety, but referring to \"the hope of salvation,\" why we may with confidence put on such a hope as a helmet. God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain - or, to the acquisition of - salvation by - or, through - our Lord Jesus Christ. Not through the doctrine of Christ, nor even through faith in Christ, but through the Lord Jesus Christ himself, through what he has done for us, and especially through his atoning death. The appointment of God's grace is here mentioned as the efficient cause of our salvation; and the Lord Jesus Christ, as the Mediator through whom salvation is bestowed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Who died.

Here not to be taken in an ethical sense - whether we are spiritually awake or asleep, for those who are spiritually asleep will be surprised by the coming of the Lord; nor in a natural sense - whether he come in the night and find us taking our natural sleep, or in the day, when we are awake - which would be a mere trifling observation; but in a metaphorical sense - whether we are alive or dead. The apostle has just been speaking of those who are dead under the designation of those \"who are asleep\" (1 Thessalonians 4:13), and therefore it is natural to interpret the clause, \"whether we wake or sleep,\" of the condition of believers at the coming of the Lord. There is here certainly a change of metaphor: \"sleep\" in ver. 6 denotes religious carelessness; in ver. 7, natural sleep; and here, death. We shall live together - or, in one company - with him. The apostle is still continuing his consolatory address to those who were mourning over their deceased friends; and he tells them that at the advent there will be no difference between those who are then alive and those who sleep - both will live together with the Lord (comp. Romans 14:8, 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Wherefore; because, whether alive or dead, you will equally share in the blessings of the advent. Comfort yourselves together. The words refer back to the last verse of the preceding chapter (1 Thessalonians 4:18), and with them the apostle concludes his consolatory address to those who were mourning over the loss of their friends. And edify one another; or, build up. It was a favorite figure of the apostle to compare the Christian Church and each individual believer to a building.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - With this verse commences a new paragraph. The apostle adds in conclusion a few brief and somewhat miscellaneous exhortations. And we beseech you, brethren; an expression of earnestness and affection. To know; that is, to value, appreciate, and esteem. Them which labor among you. It was Paul's custom to organize the Churches which he had founded, and to appoint presbyters among them. Although the Church of Thessalonica had been so recently founded, yet it had its presbyters. And are over you. The presbyters, in virtue of their office, presided over the Christian assemblies. In the Lord; the sphere in which they were set over the Church; they were ordained to minister in sacred things. And admonish you. There are not three classes or orders of office-bearers here mentioned - those who labored among them, those who presided over them, and those who admonished them (Mac-knight); but all these duties belonged to one class, namely, the presbyters.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake; that is, both on account of their labors, and especially on account of the dignity of their office, for their work is the work of the Lord. Both love for their persons and respect for their authority are here enjoined. And; to be omitted, as not in the original. Be at peace among yourselves. A new exhortation, entirely independent of the preceding; it is not addressed to the presbyters, but to the members of the Church in general.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Now we exhort you, brethren; an exhortation also addressed to all. Warn them that are unruly; or, as in the margin, disorderly (R.V.). Different modes of treatment have to be adapted to different classes; the unruly have to be warned. The word here rendered \"unruly\" or \"disorderly\" was originally a military term expressing the character of those soldiers who would not keep their ranks - out of the ranks. It would seem from this and other intimations that disorders existed among the Thessalonians; and that, especially being impressed by a belief in the near approach of the advent, several of them neglected the common duties of life, and abstained from working. Comfort the feebleminded. By \"the feeble-minded\" are meant the desponding or faint-hearted; those who were agitated about the fate of their deceased friends, or those who despaired of the grace of God by reason of their sins. These were not to be reprimanded, but comforted and exhorted. Support the weak. By \"the weak\" are not meant those who are physically weak - the sick; but those who are spiritually weak, whose faith was feeble - those who were afraid of persecution, or were troubled with vain scruples. These were to be supported - confirmed in the faith, be patient toward all men; all men in general, whether believers or unbelievers; toward them patience and forbearance were to be exercised.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSee that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - See that none render evil for evil unto any. The prohibition of revenge is peculiarly Christian, neither corresponding to the spirit of heathenism, nor yet clearly revealed in Judaism. A precisely similar prohibition is given in Romans 12:17, \"Recompense to no man evil for evil.\" But ever follow; pursue after. That which is good; the good, the beneficial. Both among yourselves; your fellow-Christians. And to all men. The human race in general; the one being brotherly kindness and the other charity (2 Peter 1:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice evermore.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Rejoice evermore; or, rejoice always (R.V.). Joy is that feeling of delight which arises from the possession of present good, or from the anticipation of future happiness; and in both respects the believer has abundant reason for constant joy. He possesses the blessedness of forgiveness and the sure prospect of eternal life, and he has the consciousness that all things work together for good to them that love God (Romans 8:28). God wishes his people to be happy, and does not suffer them to be indifferent to their own peace. He commands them to rejoice, yea, to rejoice evermore. \"Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice\" (Philippians 4:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTPray without ceasing.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Pray without ceasing. The means of promoting religious joy is prayer. This prayer is to be \"without ceasing,\" implying constancy (Colossians 4:2) and perseverance (Romans 12:12; Ephesians 6:18; Luke 18:1). This is not a mere precept \"capable of fulfillment in idea, rather than in fact\" (Jowett); but it is an exhortation to live in a devotional frame of mind. It is impossible to be always on our bended knees, but we may be in the spirit of prayer when engaged in the duties of our earthly calling. Prayer may be without ceasing in the heart which is full of the presence of God, and evermore communing with him.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - In everything give thanks. In every circumstance - in joy and in sorrow; for everything - for prosperity and for adversity; in every place - in the house of God and on the bed of sickness; Christians should not only be engaged in constant prayer, but in constant thanksgiving; indeed, their prayers should partake largely of the nature of thanksgiving. For this; this thankful spirit. Is the will of God; his desire. In Christ Jesus; the sphere in which this will of God is displayed. Concerning you. God by the gift of his Son has laid us under the obligation of perpetual thanksgiving. Our whole lives ought to be one continued thank-offering for all the blessings of redemption.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTQuench not the Spirit.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Quench not the Spirit. The Spirit is here considered as a flame which may be extinguished (Matthew 3:11). The descent of the Spirit at Pentecost was in the form of cloven tongues like as of fire (Acts 2:3). By the Spirit here is usually understood the miraculous gifts of the Spirit - speaking with tongues or prophesyings; and it is supposed that the apostle here forbids the exercise of these gifts being hindered or checked. In the next verse the gift of prophesying is mentioned. But there is no reason to exclude the ordinary and still more valuable gifts of the Spirit, such as pure thoughts, holy actions, devout affections, which may be effectually quenched by a careless or immoral life. \"Quench not the Spirit.\" Do not those things which are opposed to his influences. Be on your guard against sin, as opposed to the work of the Spirit in the soul. In this sense the admonition is similar to that given by Paul in his Epistle to the Ephesians: \"Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God\" (Ephesians 4:30).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDespise not prophesyings.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Despise not prophesyings. This refers to the miraculous gift of prophecy possessed by the primitive Church. And by prophesyings here we are to understand, not the prediction of the future, but inspired discourse, conducive to the instruction and edification of the Church. \"By the term 'prophesying,'\" observes Calvin, \"I do not understand the gift of foretelling the future, but the science of interpreting Scripture, so that a prophet is an interpreter of the will of God.\" This useful gift, it would seem, was apt to be despised, and the inferior miraculous gift of tongues to be preferred before it (1 Corinthians 14:1-3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTProve all things; hold fast that which is good.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - Prove all things. This exhortation is closely connected with the preceding. \"Prove all things,\" namely, whatever was advanced by the prophets in their inspired discourses (comp. 1 John 4:1, \"Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God\"). \"Prove\" here means to test, as metals are tested in the fire; and hence the word frequently denotes the favorable result of the testing, or approval. There was a special gift of discerning spirits in the primitive Church (1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 14:29). But although the words primarily refer to the testing of prophetic utterances, yet they have a general application. We should not rest our faith on the authority of others. The right of private judgment is the characteristic and privilege of Protestantism. We ought thoroughly to examine all doctrines by the test of Scripture, and then, discerning their reasons, we shall be able to take a firmer hold of them. At the same time, the fundamental principle of rationalism, that reason as such is the judge of the doctrines of revelation, is not contained in these words, and cannot be inferred from them. Hold fast; retain. That which is good; the good, the beautiful, the honorable; a different word from that rendered \"good\" in ver. 15. We are to retain whatever is good in those \"all things\" which we are to prove or test, namely, in the prophesyings.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAbstain from all appearance of evil.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Abstain from all appearance of evil. This verse is connected with the last, and states negatively what is there stated positively. Test the declarations of the prophets; retain the good, and reject the evil. The word translated \"appearance\" has been differently rendered; it denotes form, figure, species, kind; so that the clause is to be rendered, \"Abstain from all form of evil\" (R.V.), or, \"of the evil,\" the word being an abstract substantive. The whole exhortation is similar to that given in Romans 12:9, only there the negative statement is put first: \"Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.\" Some suppose that the metaphor employed is from the practice of money-changers who tested the money offered to them, rejecting what was base and retaining what was genuine. Among the Fathers we meet with the phrase, \"Be ye experienced money-changers,\" as a traditionary saying of our Lord; and some suppose that the apostle refers to this saying, and give the following paraphrase: \"The good money keep; with every sort of bad money have nothing to do; act as experienced money-changers: all the money presented to you as good, test.\" Such a supposition is fanciful and far-fetched.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - And the very God of peace; the God who communicates peace; an expression frequently employed by Paul at the close of his Epistles (Romans 15:33; Romans 16:20; Philippians 4:9; 2 Corinthians 13:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:16). Sanctify you wholly; that is, perfectly, without anything wanting, referring to the entireness of the sanctification, which is presently expressed in detail. And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body; the adjective \"whole\" applies to all the three substantives. The apostle here divides human nature into three parts - spirit, soul, and body; and this threefold division is not a mere rhetorical statement: \"The apostle pouring forth from the fullness of his heart a prayer for his converts\" (Jowett); but a distinct statement of the three component parts of human nature. The \"spirit\" is the highest part of man, that which assimilates him to God; renders him capable of religion, and susceptible of being acted upon by the Spirit of God. The \"soul\" is the inferior part of his mental nature, the seat of the passions and desires, of the natural propensities. The \"body\" is the corporeal frame. Such a threefold distinction of human nature was not unknown among the Stoics and Platonists. There are also traces of it in the Old Testament, the spirit, or breath of God, being distinguished from the soul. Be preserved blameless. \"The spirit is preserved blameless at the advent when the voice of truth rules it, the soul when it strives against all the charms of the senses, and the body when it is not abused as the instrument of shameful actions\" (Lunemann). Unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:24VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFaithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 24. - Faithful is he that calleth you. Paul knows that he does not beseech God in vain. He who calls you to the Christian faith is faithful to fulfill his promises. God's calling is the commencement of a series which terminates in glorification (Romans 8:30). A similar appeal to the faithfulness of God is elsewhere made by the apostle (1 Corinthians 1:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:3). Who also will do it; namely, will preserve you blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:25VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBrethren, pray for us.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 25. - Brethren, pray for us; namely, that our apostolic work may be successful; that \"the Word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified\" (2 Thessalonians 3:1). The apostle, in almost all his Epistles, requests from his converts an interest in their prayers (Romans 15:30; 2 Corinthians 1:11; Ephesians 6:19; Colossians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 3:1; comp. Hebrews 13:18). Ministers and people need each other's prayers, and prayer is a duty which they owe to each other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:26VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTGreet all the brethren with an holy kiss.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 26. - Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss. That certain persons were enjoined to salute the other members of the Church is a proof that the Epistle was given into the hands of the presbyters. The reference is to the mode of salutation in the East. The kiss is called \"holy\" because it was the symbol of Christian affection. The same exhortation is made in other Epistles (Romans 16:16; 1 Corinthians 16:20; 2 Corinthians 13:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:27VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 27. - I charge you; namely, the presbyters. By the Lord; namely, Christ, an indirect proof of his Divinity, the adjuration being in his Name. The reason of this solemn charge was, not on account of any remissness on the part of the presbyters, but was occasioned by the earnestness of the apostle and by his consciousness that what he wrote was most important to the Thessalonians, and was the command of the Lord Jesus Christ. That this Epistle be read unto all the holy brethren; unto the Church of Thessalonica.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTART1Thessalonians5:28VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 28. - The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. A similar salutation is to be found at the close of all Paul's Epistles; indeed, in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, he states that this salutation was the token which he affixed to his Epistles (2 Thessalonians 3:17, 18). Amen. To be rejected, as not in the original.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE"}
