This is a good instance of how the use of the same names, though in different order, clung to a tribe or family through long periods. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-2.htm">1 Chronicles 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house, <i>to wit</i>, of Tola: <i>they were</i> valiant men of might in their generations; whose number <i>was</i> in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The six sons of <span class="cmt_word">Tola</span> given here are stated to be the six heads of the house <span class="accented">at the time of the census of David</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1-17</a>). The verse further states that the Tolaites had grown to number at that time <span class="cmt_word">twenty-two thousand six hundred</span>, and as this fact is not <span class="accented">stated</span> elsewhere, it is pretty clear proof that the compiler had other sources of information in addition to those possessed by us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-3.htm">1 Chronicles 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah; Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five</span>.

The Syriac, however, does not omit "and the sons of Izrahiah;" but alters the numeral "five" to "four." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-4.htm">1 Chronicles 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">And with them, by their generations, after the house of their fathers, <i>were</i> bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty thousand <i>men</i>: for they had many wives and sons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - The meaning of these verses, especially of the former of them, is not quite evident. This seems to say that as the Tolaites were in David's time twenty-two thousand six hundred, so the Uzzites taken from among them (or the "sons of Izrahiah," as the case may be) numbered thirty-six thousand additional. But were not the Uzzites included in the Tolaites? and did not the figure thirty-six thousand embrace the accumulated numbers, whilst the balance of fifty-one thousand necessary to make up the eighty-seven thousand of ver. 5, was drawn from all the other branches of the Issachar tribe? This is not the view, however, generally taken, and if the numbers of vers. 2 and 4 are distinct, the balance needful for ver. 5 will, of course, be twenty-eight thousand four hundred. It cannot be denied that this view is favoured by the special description applied to these Uzzites, or Izrahiahites, as bands of soldiers for war; their disposition and their training constituting possibly the reason of their being singled out for further description from among the sons of Tola. The statement of the total number of the tribe of Issachar in David's time is wonderfully corroborated by the two censuses of Moses - <a href="../../par/numbers/1-28.htm">Numbers 1:28, 29</a>, fifty-four thousand four hundred; and <a href="../../par/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23-25</a>, sixty-four thousand three hundred. The total of Issachar, <span class="cmt_word">four score and seven thousand</span>, is a good proportion of the aggregate total of all the tribes, given (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8, 9</a>) as eight hundred thousand. Grove, however, adds all the above numbers, and makes thereby Issachar's total (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:901 <span class="accented">b</span>) one hundred and forty-five thousand six hundred, which seems disfavoured by the numbers at the second census of Moses. At the time of this census Issachar came third of all the tribes, only Judah and Dan taking precedence. The <span class="cmt_word">bands of soldiers for war</span>. This expression culminates in the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) "bands," which is applied (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>) to Gad, and almost invariably to the irregular but special bodies of fighting men of the nations round (Authorized Version, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23</a> is incorrect, the Hebrew word being different). The examples are too numerous to quote, but some of the more important instances are <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-20.htm">2 Kings 13:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-9.htm">Hosea 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-1.htm">Hosea 7:1</a>.

We have four passages for our authorities as to the sons of Benjamin, and it is not altogether easy to bring them into verbal harmony. They are <a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a>; the present passage; and ch. 8. Our present passage mentions three sons, as though they were all, and immediately proceeds to their posterity. The list in Genesis mentions ten, of whom, however, we know (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-40.htm">Numbers 26:40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-3.htm">1 Chronicles 8:3, 4</a>) that three, Naaman, Ard, and Gem, were grandsons, being sons of Bela, under which circumstances the order in which the two former stand in Genesis is remarkable. Again, while Becher is given as the second son in both Genesis and our present place, he is not mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38-41</a> and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. Ashbel, who in Genesis is given as the third, is expressly called the second son. Among the Ephraimites, however (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>), a Becher, with his descendants the Bachrites, is mentioned, and it is not improbable that, by marriage, the family were at <span class="accented">that time</span>, for manifest reasons of inheritance and possession, reckoned in this tribe, though by blood of the tribe of Benjamin. This subject is skilfully discussed by Lord A. C. Hervey (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:175). Lastly, Jediael of this passage and ver. 10 is not found in Genesis, in Numbers, or in our ch. 8. This name seems to have superseded in our passage the name Ashbel in Genesis, though it is impossible to speak certainly. It cannot be supposed to designate the same person, but rather a descendant in the same branch, whose family had come to importance "in the days of David."

Bertheau takes the opportunity of urging, in connection with this name, that <span class="accented">Dan</span> is not entirely omitted in our work of Chronicles! But his foundation is surely far too slender to build upon. Bertheau and Zockler (in Lange, 'Alt.

In an order quite different from the otherwise parallel passages (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-24.htm">Genesis 46:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-48.htm">Numbers 26:48-50</a>), the tribe of Naphtali is taken. Naphtali was the second son of Rachel's handmaid Bilhah, and in order of birth the fifth sen of Jacob, and was of course more closely allied to Dan, Ephraim, and Benjamin. The family was distinguished for its spirit throughout its history. At the Sinai census it numbered fifty-three thousand four hundred fighting men (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-42.htm">Numbers 1:42, 43</a>); but at the close of the wanderings through the wilderness its numbers had become only forty-five thousand four hundred. Its territory in the north, largely mountainous, bounded by Asher, Zebulun, and Manasseh, was some of the finest, and covered the district afterwards called Galilee, "the cradle of the Christian faith, the native place of most of the apostles, and the home of our Lord" (Grove). The slight difference in the spelling of <span class="cmt_word">Jahziel</span> in Genesis, and of <span class="cmt_word">Shallum</span> in Numbers, may be noticed. The following are interesting references to Naphtali in one or another portion of its history: - <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-33.htm">Judges 1:33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-18.htm">Judges 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-19.htm">1 Chronicles 27:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-3.htm">Ezekiel 48:3, 4, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-6.htm">Revelation 7:6</a>.

The tribe of Manasseh has been partly treated of in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23-26</a>, viz. those of the tribe who inhabited Gilead and Bashan. Here those who inhabited this side Jordan are treated cf.

In these places six families, or heads of families, are noted to only two, or at most three here, viz.

The opening clause of this verse also is unmanageable as it stands. One way of reducing it to coherence would be to Supply the words "his wife" between whom and bars, the similarity of the Hebrew letters of which to those of the Hebrew for "whom" might possibly account for the loss of it. The parenthesis about the concubine would then read with emphasis. But there is not the slightest reason to suppose there was such a wife. Another way would be to read the concubine as the mother of Ashriel, and prefix a conjunction, and, to the second "bare;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> and she bare, or, she bare also Machir." But it seems pretty plain from Numbers and Joshua that Ashriel was not strictly a son, but only descendant of Manasseh; and, further, the irresistible impression is that Machir was the only son, strictly speaking (see especially <a href="../../par/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). The position of Ashriel in our present passage, first, is also very unsatisfactory in face of <a href="../../par/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a> and the other references already given.

The remaining two names, Ezer and Elead, may perhaps be two brothers of the first Shuthelah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> own sons of Ephraim. If it be so, these two must not be supposed to correspond with Becher and Tahan, called "sons of Ephraim" in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-35.htm">Numbers 26:35</a>; for it is evident that they were generations <span class="accented">succeeding</span> Shuthelah. Now, Ephraim was born in Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a>), so that, on the above showing, the actual sons of Ephraim must have made some incursion from Egypt into the territories of the settled or possibly aboriginal inhabitants of Gath, and met the fate over which Ephraim so mourned. Such excursions on the part of the Israelites out of Egypt have very little collateral evidence. But there would seem to be no impossibility in the matter, considering <a href="../../par/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13-23</a>. Next, vers. 23-27 seem to say that in his sorrow Ephraim has another son, whom he names Beriah, and of whose line in the ninth descent comes Joshua, the son of Nun. This also is very doubtful. It may very possibly be that the parenthesis continues to the end of ver. 23 or 24, and that vers. 25-27 carry on the generations from ver. 21. Meantime welcome light breaks in at the stage (ver. 26) at which Ammihud and Elishama are mentioned. For we find these immediate ancestors of the great Joshua repeatedly mentioned at the period of the Exodus (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-10.htm">Numbers 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/7-48.htm">Numbers 7:48</a>, etc.); yet none of these places assist us to say that he did or did not come through Beriah. It is impossible to solve with any certainty the involved question of chronology and genealogy presented by this section. The passage is evidently mutilated and corrupt, though vindicating a high antiquity. Avery original presentation of the whole section, as ingenious as it is conjectural, by Lord A.C. Hervey, may be found in the art. "Shuthclah," Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1305. It is well worthy of attention that a great point is made in bringing Joshua to the place of the eighth generation from Joseph, in near analogy with the numbers in so many other known cases, of the generations that intervened from the descent into Egypt to the entrance into Canaan. There also may be found the most and best that can be said against the literal reading of what is here written respecting the men of Gath and the cattle.

If the literal interpretation of this whole section be accepted, according to which both Ephraim and Beriah must have passed their lifetime in Egypt, the "daughter," strictly so called, of either the one or the other could not have been the founder of the places here mentioned.
