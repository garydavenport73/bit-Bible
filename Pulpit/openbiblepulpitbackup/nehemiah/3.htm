It is satisfactory to find Eliashib the high priest taking the part which befitted him on this occasion. Subsequently we find him "allied by marriage to Tobiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>), and guilty of a profanation of the temple (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 5). By the line of high priests given in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>, it appears that Eliashib was the son of Joiakim, and the grandson of the Jeshua who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his brethren</span>. The priests generally. Compare ver. 28, which shows that the priests undertook a portion of the eastern wall, besides the work here mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Builded the sheep gate</span>. The "sheep gate" appears to have been a gate in the eastern wall, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> of St. John (John %;2), which was close to the pool of Bethesda. By this gate were brought in the sheep needed for sacrifice, which were then washed in the adjoining pool, and conveyed from it into the temple area, whereon the pool abuts. The priests dwelt principally in this portion of the city. <span class="cmt_word">They sanctified it</span>. This appears to have been a dedication quite distinct from that which is described in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>. The priests, having completed the rebuilding of the sheep gate, and of the wall extending from it northwards as far as the tower of Hananeel, anticipated the general dedication by a special one, which "sanctified," or consecrated, their own portion of the wall Thus a sacred character was impressed on the work at the earliest possible moment, and it was placed under the protection of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Meah</span> (or rather Hammeah, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Hundred") and <span class="cmt_word">the tower of Hananeel</span> appear to have been situated almost at the same point of the wall. Perhaps they were opposite each other, like the towers in the walls of Babylon (Herod., 1:179).

There is no other similar omission. <span class="cmt_word">The fish gate</span>, which they built, was in the northern wall, towards its eastern extremity, and not far from the modern "Damascus gate." It is thought to be so called from being the gate through which fish were brought in from the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">The locks thereof</span> should rather be "the bars thereof"; and <span class="cmt_word">the bars</span>, "the sockets," or "catches," which held the bars.

It was a small place, and does not appear, either in the catalogue of those who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-20.htm">Ezra 2:20-35</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25-38</a>), or in the census list of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their nobles put not their necks to the work</span>. This imputation of blame has been thought out of harmony with the general narrative contained in the chapter, and various emendations have been proposed to remove the so-called difficulty. But it has really first to be shown that a difficulty exists. Surely it would have been more strange if there had been no opposition to Nehemiah's wishes - no withdrawal from the work, than if there were the amount of opposition that is recorded. And supposing opposition to be made, why should Nehemiah not notice it? In music, the force and value of harmonious notes is brought out by an occasional discord. A desire to do honour to those who deserved it would be quite compatible with a determination to brand with disgrace the undeserving. And the contrast would enhance the value of the praise. Thus, there is no reason for disturbing the existing text, nor for questioning its plain meaning. The upper classes at Tekoah, the <span class="accented">adirim</span> or "exalted, withdrew from the work, like oxen withdrawing their necks from the yoke, and stood aloof, leaving it to the common people to engage in it, or not, as they pleased. The common people were perhaps moved to the greater zeal by the defection of their natural leaders. They were among those who accomplished a double task, repairing a second portion of the wall (ver. 27) after having finished their first. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The old gate</span> must either have corresponded to the modern "Damascus gate" or have been in its near neighbourhood. It is not mentioned elsewhere.

Unto the throne of the governor on this side the river</span>. So the Septuagint; and, among moderns, Michaelis, Pool, and A. Clarke. Others translate - "the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor across the river." But this can scarcely have been the fact, since Gibeon is mentioned among the re-occupied cities in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25</a>, and if Bethel was Jewish, as we know that it was from <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, Gibeon and Mizpah, which were nearer Jerusalem, cannot have remained Syrian. Altogether, there is no reason to dispute the commonly received rendering, since Nehemiah again uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> in ver. 32, and the governor of Syria may well have had a "throne," or tribunal, at Jerusalem, which was usually under his jurisdiction, though exempted from his authority under the existing <span class="accented">regime</span>.

It seems to be almost impossible that women were pressed into the service, especially when it was one of so much danger (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-21</a>). By "daughters" we must therefore understand the villages contained in Shallum's district, which is agreeable to the use of the term in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25, 27, 28</a>.

We can scarcely suppose that the inhabitants had as much as <span class="cmt_word">a thousand cubits</span> of the wall assigned to them, since that is more than a quarter of a mile, and the entire circuit was under four miles. Bertheau suggests that Nehemiah merely means to note that the distance between the two gates, the Valley and the Dung gate, was a thousand cubits, and that he says nothing of the repairs because no repairs were needed.

The pool must always have been outside of the main wall of the city. It furnished water to the royal garden, which was at the junction of the Kidron and Hinnora valleys (Joseph. 'Ant. Jud.,' 7:11; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The stairs that go down from the city of David</span> may well be the flight of stone steps cut in the rock which is still to be seen on the western flank of Ophel, leading from the valley of the Tyropeeon in the direction of the temple (see Stanley, 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Third Series, p. 126; Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 190).

The construction is not free from difficulty, and the reading is somewhat doubtful (the Vulgate "in monte" showing a different one); but on the whole the translation of the A. V. may stand. Baruch has the high honour of being singled out for special praise, as having shown a burning zeal which deserved this recompense. He rapidly accomplished the task first set him, the mention of which must have accidentally fallen out (see the comment on ver. 11), and now undertook a "second piece," which extended from the north-western angle of the inner wall to the door of the high priest's house.

The "king's house" of this place can be nothing but the old palace of David, which was in this quarter, while Solomon's was on the opposite, or western, hill This palace, like Solomon s (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>), would naturally have its <span class="cmt_word">prison</span>, which would stand in its own <span class="cmt_word">court</span>. From this prison, the "prison gate" of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a> took its name. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto <i>the place</i> over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Nethinims dwelt in Ophel</span>. Ophel was "the long, narrowish, rounded spur or promontory which intervenes between the central valley of Jerusalem (the Tyropoeon) and the Kidron, or Valley of Jehoshaphat" (Grove). The Nethinims, who had their dwellings on this spur, were set to fortify a portion of the eastern circuit, but apparently restored not so much their own wall as that which lay north of it, at the edge of the present Haram area. Here must have been <span class="cmt_word">the water gate</span>, which carried off the superfluous water from the temple reservoirs; and here was <span class="cmt_word">the great tower that lieth out</span>, whose foundations have been recently discovered. It stood at the southeastern angle of the great platform on which the temple was built. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a></div><div class="verse">After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Tekoites repaired another piece</span>. Compare ver. 5. Their "second piece" appears to have extended from the "great tower" to the wall built by Shallum on the western side of the spur which reached as far as the pool of Siloam (ver. 15). This is here called "the wall of Ophel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a></div><div class="verse">From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From above the horse gate</span>. This was a gate in the eastern wall (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>) through which horses could enter the city. It probably adjoined the old palace, being at or near the "turning of the wall" mentioned in vers. 24, 25. Nehemiah seems here to return to the point quitted in ver. 26, and to proceed thence northwards in order to complete the entire circuit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-29.htm">Nehemiah 3:29</a></div><div class="verse">After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah</span> is very possibly the descendant of David mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a>. He must have been an old man, as his son, Hattush, had returned to Jerusalem with Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2, 3</a>); but still he may have taken part in the work. That he was <span class="cmt_word">keeper of the east gate</span> does not militate against this hypothesis, for that post was an honourable one, and it is not to be supposed that all the descendants of David were in flourishing circumstances. By "the east gate"we are perhaps to understand "the water gate towards the east" of ver. 26. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-30.htm">Nehemiah 3:30</a></div><div class="verse">After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After him</span>. The traditional text gives "after me;" and it has been supposed that Nehemiah assigned himself a certain portion of the wall and repaired it, but suppressed his own name through modesty. But, as general superintendent of the whole (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-23</a>), he could scarcely take any special work; and the argument that might have been founded upon a single occurrence of the expression "after me" is deprived of all force by its double occurrence, here and in ver. 31. <span class="cmt_word">Another piece</span>. A Hanun has been mentioned (ver. 13) among the leaders of the working parties, and also a Hananiah (ver. 8); but they were not coupled together; and it may well be questioned whether either is identical with his namesake of this verse. Probably we have here another instance of the incompleteness of our present text of this chapter (see the comment on ver. 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a></div><div class="verse">After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Malchiah the goldsmith's son</span>. Or "the son of Hazzorephi." But the mention of goldsmiths (<span class="accented">zorephim</span>) in ver. 32 lends support to the rendering of the A. V., which is accepted by most critics. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the place of the Nethinims</span>. Rather, "the house." The exact position cannot be fixed; but <span class="cmt_word">the gate Miphkad</span> must have been situated in the east wall, a little to the south of the sheep gate. <span class="cmt_word">The going up of the corner</span> may have been an "ascent," like Solomon's (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a>), which was probably a flight of steps; or the word translated "going up" may mean "an upper chamber" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> a chamber situated over the gate.

Compare ver. 1. The circuit is completed, and the point reached from which the commencement was made. <span class="cmt_word">The goldsmiths and the merchants</span> were required to repair the piece of wall immediately to the south of the sheep gate, for which no individual had volunteered. Probably they had houses in the neighbourhood. They consented; and thus the entire wall was taken in hand, and the great work, which Nehemiah had conceived in his heart while still in Susa, was inaugurated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../nehemiah/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Nehemiah 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../nehemiah/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Nehemiah 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Nehemiah 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
