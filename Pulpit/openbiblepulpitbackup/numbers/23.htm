The number seven was especially connected with the revelation of the tree God, the Creator of the world, and was probably observed here for this reason. The sacrifices were offered no doubt to Jehovah.

It might be concluded from <a href="../../par/numbers/24-1.htm">Numbers 24:1</a> that Balaam went only to look for "auguries," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, for such natural signs in the flight of birds and the like as the heathen were wont to observe as manifestations of the favour or disfavour of God, the success or failure of enterprises. It seems clear that it was his practice to do so, either as having some faith himself in such uncertainties, or as stooping to usual heathen arts which he inwardly despised. But from the fact that God met him (we know not how), and that such supernatural communication was not unexpected, we may conclude that Balaam's words meant more for himself than the mere observance of auguries, whatever they may have meant for Balak. To an high place. Rather, "to a bald place" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> - compare the meaning of "Calvary"), from which the immediate prospect was uninterrupted.

Balaam's utterances were in the highest degree poetical, according to the antithetic form of the poetry of that day, which delighted in sustained parallelisms, in lofty figures, and in abrupt turns. The <span class="accented">"mashal"</span> of Balaam resembled the "burden" of the later prophets in this, that it was not a discourse uttered to men, but a thing revealed in him of which he had to deliver himself as best he might in such words as came to him. His inward eye was fixed on this revelation, and he gave utterance to it without consideration of those who heard. Aram, i.e., Aram-Naharaim, or Mesopotamia (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>). Defy, or "threaten,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with the wrath of Heaven. Jacob. The use of this name as the poetical equivalent of Israel shows that Balaam was familiar with the story of the patriarch, and understood his relation to the people before him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/23-8.htm">Numbers 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, <i>whom</i> the LORD hath not defied?</div><div class="comm">

It was not the outward isolation on which his eye was fixed, for that indeed was only temporary and accidental, but the religious and moral separateness of Israel as the chosen people of God, which was the very secret of their national greatness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth <i>part</i> of Israel?

The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, apparently from an incorrect reading. The Samaritan and the older versions, followed by the Vulgate, render it "progeny,'" but this meaning is conjectural, and there seems no sufficient reason to depart from the common translation. <span class="cmt_word">Let me die the death</span>  <span class="cmt_word">of the righteous.</span> The word "righteous" is in the plural (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>): it may refer either to the Israelites as a holy nation, living and dying in the favour of God; or to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, the promises made to whom, in faith of which they died, were already so gloriously fulfilled. If the former reference was intended, Balaam must have had a much fuller and happier knowledge of "life and immortality" than the Israelites themselves, to whom death was dreadful, all the more that it ended a life protected and blessed by God (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10-12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). It is hardly credible that so singular an anticipation of purely Christian feeling should really be found in the mouth of a prophet of that day, for it is clear that the words, however much inspired, did express the actual emotion of Balaam at the moment. It is therefore more consistent with the facts and probabilities of the case to suppose that Balaam referred to righteous Abraham (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) and his immediate descendants, and wished that when he came to die he might have as sure a hope as they had enjoyed that God would bless and multiply their seed, and make their name to be glorious in the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Let my last end be like his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (last end) is the same word translated "latter days" and "latter end" in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14, 20</a>. It means the last state of a people or of a man as represented in his offspring; the sense is not incorrectly expressed by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>.

Both the meaning of the nouns and the tense of the verb are disputed. By some <span class="accented">"e ephes katsehu"</span> (the end of the last of them) is held equivalent to "the whole of them," which seems to contradict the next clause even if defensible in itself. The ordinary rendering is favoured by the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and by the Targums. On the other hand, some would read the verb in the present tense, and understand Balak's words to refer to the place they were leaving. This is in accordance with the statement in <a href="../../par/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, and it would certainly seem as if Balak and Balaam moved each time nearer to that encampment which was for different masons the center of attraction to them both.

Balaam does not say whom or what he is going to meet, but from the use of the same term in chapter 24. I it is evident that he employed the language of soothsayers looking for auguries.

If it is God, according to the A.V., then it means that God in his mercy shut his eyes to the evil which did exist in individuals, and for his own sake would not impute it to the chosen nation.

It is evident, however, from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a> and other passages that the teem had two hems, and that its horns were its most prominent feature. It would also appear from <a href="../../par/job/39-9.htm">Job 39:9-12</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a> that, while itself untameable, it was allied to species employed in husbandry. The reem may therefore have been the aurochs or urus, now extinct, but which formerly had so large a range in the forests of the old world. There is some doubt, however, whether the urns existed in those days in Syria, and it may have been a wild buffalo, or some kindred animal of the bovine genus, whose size, fierceness, and length of horn made it a wonder and a fear.

The rising of a lion from its covert was one of the most common of the more striking phenomena of nature in those regions, and the imagery it afforded was in constant use; but in truth it is evident that these similes are borrowed from Jacob's dying prophecy concerning Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>), in which the word "prey" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, a torn thing) is also found.

From Peer, therefore, the whole encampment, in all its length and breadth, would lie beneath their gaze. Jeshi-men. See on Numbers 21:20.
