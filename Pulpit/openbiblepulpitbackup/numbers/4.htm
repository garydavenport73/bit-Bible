In the wilderness a larger number of the men might be required to attend to their own camps, and their own families; but the explanation may probably be found in the unusually large proportion who were at this time between the ages of thirty and fifty. The Septuagint has altered thirty into twenty-five to make it agree with <a href="../../par/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>. Thirty years became among the Jews the perfect age at which a man attained to full maturity, and entered upon all his fights and duties (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the host.</span> Not the military ranks, but the <span class="accented">militia sacra</span> of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">To do the work.</span> Literally, "to war the warfare."

The Targum of Palestine, and the Septuagint, both render it "a covering of hyacinthine skin." The later Jews would have no knowledge of the marine animals common on the shores of the Red Sea. <span class="cmt_word">A cloth wholly of blue.</span> This was the distinctive outer, and therefore Visible, covering of the <span class="accented">most</span> sacred thing, the ark. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal.</span> Rather, "the plates, the bowls, the wine pitchers, and the chalices for pouring out," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the drink offerings.

It would therefore be natural to suppose that the staves had all been taken out while the various coverings were put on. On the other hand, it is expressly directed in <a href="../../par/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a> that the staves of the ark shall "not be taken from it." Two explanations are possible. Either the former command does not contemplate the necessity of wrapping up the ark, and only applies to all times when it was at rest, or in movement; or else the latter direction only means, in the case of the ark, that the staves should be adjusted for the purpose of bearing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-9.htm">Numbers 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Snuff-dishes.</span> Some render this word "extinguishers," but it could hardly bear that meaning, since it also signifies censers in chapter Numbers 16:6, and fire-pans in <a href="../../par/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>. They were evidently shallow metal pans available for many different purposes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-10.htm">Numbers 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put <i>it</i> upon a bar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon a bar</span> - i.e., a bearing-frame. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint; "upon a rest," Targum of Palestine.

They are not packed up with it, but separately, in a blue cloth and a skin covering of their own. Probably they include all the vessels and utensils used inside the tabernacle which have not been previously mentioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-13.htm">Numbers 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the ashes.</span> This is omitted by the Septuagint. The Hebrew word for "ashes is of somewhat doubtful meaning, being only used here and in <a href="../../par/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> (see margin). Being connected with the word "fat," it may perhaps mean the grease or dripping from the burnt offerings. The Targum of Palestine renders it "cinders." As the altar was hollow, and was filled with earth or stones when used, there would be no need to cleanse it from ashes; if this be the meaning of the word, the command would rather have been to collect the living embers before the altar was removed, in order to keep alive the sacred fire. That this fire was never allowed to go out may be looked upon as certain. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-14.htm">Numbers 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, <i>even</i> the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.</div><div class="comm">

Anyhow, the omission is very remarkable, and may have been accidental. It is supplied by the Septuagint and the Samaritan text in the following addition to verse 14: "And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot, and they shall put it into a hyacinthine cover of skin, and put it on bars." The burdens of the Kohathites were six, not counting the laver and its foot: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the ark; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the table of shewbread; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the candelabrum; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the golden altar; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> "instruments of ministry;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the frame of the brazen altar.

On him was laid the oversight of and the responsibility for all the material appliances of Divine worship, and in especial it devolved upon him to see to the oil, the incense, and the chrism, and the materials for the daily meat offering. No doubt it is intended, although not precisely expressed, that the Kohathites were specially under his orders. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-17.htm">Numbers 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-18.htm">Numbers 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites.</span> The word tribe (<span class="accented">shebet</span>) is used in an unusual way here, not in the sense of <span class="accented">tribus</span>, but of <span class="accented">stirps.</span> Perhaps as Levi was himself a microcosm of all Israel, so his families ranked as tribes; and no doubt they remained more distinct than the families of any other tribe. The meaning of the command is plainly this, "Take care that the Kohathites are not cut off through any negligence or want of consideration on your part; and the form of the command, "cut ye not off," conveyed most emphatically the warning, that if any mischief befell the Kohathites which the priests could have prevented, they would be responsible for it in the sight of God. No doubt, as a fact, the Kohathites would take their cue from the conduct of the priests: if <span class="accented">they</span> were irreverent and careless, the Levites would be the same, and would sooner or later presume, and, presuming, would die. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-19.htm">Numbers 4:19</a></div><div class="verse">But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus do unto them,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, exactly as commanded in verses 5-15. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/4-20.htm">Numbers 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered.</span> This translation is disputed. The word rendered "are covered" is the Piel infinitive from <span class="accented">bala</span>, to swallow, and so to destroy. It may signify the extreme rapidity with which the most holy things were hidden from sight and removed from touch, so as to become, as it were, non-existent for the time. So the Syriac, Arabic, Samaritan, and the Targums of Onkelos and Palestine. On the other hand, it may be a proverbial expression, "in a swallow, at a gulp," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "for an instant," as in <a href="../../par/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>. And so the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and most modern scholars. Whichever way, however, we take it, the phrase, "they shall not go in to see," seems to limit the prohibition under pain of death to the deliberate act of entering the tabernacle out of curiosity during the process of packing up the holy things. The case of the men of  Bethshemesh, therefore (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>), does not fall within the letter of this law, although it does within its spirit. The command, thus limited, is no doubt an addition to the previous command not to touch, but it is altogether in keeping with it. If it was the will of God to hedge about these sacred symbols of his presence and his worship with an awful sanctity, it is obvious that he was as much bound to defend them against the irreverent prying of the eye as against the irreverent touch of the hand; and the prying here prohibited would have been distinctly willful and inexcusable.

No doubt it <span class="accented">was</span> carried out with extreme solicitude, as made for a purpose especially sacred and important. The results are remarkable in more ways than one. The following table presents the numbers in each family above one month, and between the ages of thirty and fifty. Kohath, 86002750percent 32<br />Gershon, 75002630 <span class="accented"></span><span class="accented"> </span>35<br />Merari, 62003200 5122,800858038The first conclusion which naturally arises from these figures is, that after all the numbering must have been made by tens, and not by individuals. As it was impossible that 3000 persons could be employed in carrying the various portions of the tabernacle, it may be that each group of ten undertook a unit of responsibility. The second consideration is, that the average of men between thirty and fifty in all Levi is higher than modern statistics show (it is said to be twenty-five per cent. now in the whole population), although not very materially. The third is, that this average is very unequally distributed, rising to a most remarkable proportion in the case of Merari. It is quite clear that something must have disturbed the relative numbers as between the Merarites and the other families. It has been suggested that the small number of male Levites generally, and the small number of male Kohathites, between thirty and fifty especially, may have been caused by heavy losses incurred in carrying out the Divine sentence upon the worshippers of the golden calf (<a href="../../par/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>). But - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The slow increase of Levi continued to be very observable down to the time of David; while the other tribes grew from 600,000 to 1,300,000, he only increased to 38,000 (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The average of males over thirty is already higher among the Kohathites than might have been expected; it is the largeness of the number, not the smallness, which needs to be explained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It is Merari, and not Kohath, that is markedly distinguished from the other two: there is little difference between Kohath and Gershon. It is evident that something must have happened to the tribe of Levi, and in especial to the family of Merari, to reduce very greatly the number of births within the last thirty years. We do not know what the causes were, or why they should have pressed much more heavily on one tribe, or one family, than on another; but it is easy to see that many such causes may have acted, and acted unequally, under the cruel tyranny of Pharaoh. The children may have been systematically slaughtered, or marriages may have largely ceased, while Moses was in the land of  Midian. If this were generally the case, it would much diminish the estimated total of the nation, and still more the estimated difficulties of the march.
