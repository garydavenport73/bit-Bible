These women would appear to have been in the eighth generation from Jacob, which hardly accords with the 470 years required by the narrative; some links, however, may have been dropped.

It does not appear why they should have thought it necessary to make this statement, unless they felt that the fact of his having died without sons might raise suspicion against him as one who had greatly provoked the wrath of God. <span class="cmt_word">But died in his own sin.</span> This cannot mean that Zelophehad was one of those who died in the wilderness  in consequence of the rebellion at Kadesh (see the next note). Apparently his daughters meant to acknowledge that they had no complaint against the Divine justice because of their father's death, but only against the law because of the unnecessary hardship which it inflicted upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/27-4.htm">Numbers 27:4</a></div><div class="verse">Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son?

The request assumes that the "brethren" of Zelophehad would receive an inheritance in the promised land, either personally or as represented by their sons; hence it seems clear that Zelophehad was not of the elder generation, which had forfeited all their rights and expectations in Canaan, but of the younger, to whom the inheritance was transferred (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-32</a>). This is confirmed by the consideration that these women were not married until some time after this (<a href="../../par/numbers/36-11.htm">Numbers 36:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/17-8.htm">Joshua 17:8, 4</a>), and must, therefore, according to the almost invariable custom, have been quite young at this time. It is reasonable to suppose that the heads of separate families to whom the land was distributed would be at this time men of from forty-five to sixty years of age, comprising the elder half of the generation which grew up in the wilderness. Zelophehad would have been among these, but that he was cut off, perhaps in the plague of serpents, or in the plague of the Arboth Mesh, and left only unmarried girls to represent him.

The Mosaic law of succession followed the same lines as the feudal law of Europe, equally disallowing disposition by will, and discouraging, if not disallowing, alienation by grant. Upon the land was to rest the whole social fabric of Israel, and all that was valued and permanent in family life and feeling was to be tied as it were to the landed inheritance. Hence the land was in every case so to pass that the name and fame, the privilege and duty, of the deceased owner might be as far as possible perpetuated. <span class="cmt_word">Unto his daughter.</span> Not for her maintenance, but in order that her husband might represent her father. In most cases he would take her name, and be counted as one of her father's family. This had no doubt already become customary among the Jews, as among almost all nations. Compare the cases of Sheshan and Jarha (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-34.htm">1 Chronicles 2:34, 35</a>), of Jair (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>), and subsequently of the Levitical "sons of Barzillai" (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a>). The question, however, would only become of public importance at the time when Israel became a nation of landed proprietors.

Abarim was apparently the range behind the Arboth Moab, the northern portion of which opposite to Jericho was called Pisgah (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a>), and the highest point Nebo (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>), after the name of a neighbouring town (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And see the land.</span> Moses had already been told that he should not enter the promised land (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>), yet he is allowed the consolation of seeing it with his eyes before his death.

The Urim of this passage and of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a> seems identical with the Urim and Thummim of <a href="../../par/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>.
