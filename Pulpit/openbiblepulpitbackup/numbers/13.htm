<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send thou men, that they may search the land.</span> If this account of the mission of the spies be compared with that given in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20-25</a>, it may be seen in a striking instance how entirely different a colour may be put upon the same circumstances by two inspired narratives. No one indeed will affirm that the two records are contradictory, or even inconsistent, and yet they leave an entirely different impression upon the mind; and no doubt were intended to. It is important to note that the Divine inspiration did not in the least prevent two sacred authors (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a> with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>), or even the same author at different times, from placing on record very distinct and even strongly contrasted aspects of the same facts, according to the point of view from which he was led to regard them. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, Moses reminds the people that on their arrival at Kadesh he had bidden them go up and take possession; that <span class="accented">they</span> had then proposed to send men before them to examine the land; that the proposal had pleased him so well that he had adopted it and acted upon it. It is unquestionably strange that facts so material should have been omitted in the historical Book of Numbers. It is, however, to be considered - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That there is no contradiction between the two accounts. We may be certain from many a recorded example that Moses would not have acted on the popular suggestion without referring the matter to the Lord, and that it would be the Divine command (when given) which would really weigh with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the recital in Deuteronomy is distinctly <span class="accented">ad populum</span>, and that therefore their part in the whole transaction is as strongly emphasized as is consistent with the truth of the facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the narrative of Numbers is fragmentary, and does not profess to give a full account of matters, especially in such particulars  as do not directly concern the Divine government and guidance of Israel. It is not, therefore, a serious difficulty that the record only begins here at the point when God adopted as his own what had been the demand of the people. If we ask why he so adopted it, the probable answer is that he knew what secret disaffection prompted it, and to what open rebellion it would lead. It was better that such disaffection should be allowed to ripen into rebellion before they entered their promised land. Miserable as the desert wandering might be, it was yet a discipline which prepared the nation for better things; whereas the invasion of Canaan without strong faith, courage, and self-restraint (such as they showed under Joshua) could but have ended in national disaster and destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man.</span> This was not part of the original proposition (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22</a>), but was agreeable to the general practice in matters of national concern, and was no doubt commanded in order that the whole people might share in the interest and responsibility of this survey. Every one a ruler among them. This does not mean that they were to be the tribe princes (as the names show), for they would not be suitable in respect of age, nor could they be spared for this service. They were "heads of the children of Israel" (verse 3), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, men of position and repute, but also no doubt comparatively young and active, as befitted a toilsome and hazardous excursion.

The order of the tribes is the same as in ch. 1, except that Zebulun is separated from the other sons of Leah, and placed after Benjamin, while the two sons of Joseph are separated from one another. In verse 11 "the tribe of Joseph" is explained to be "the tribe of Manasseh;" elsewhere it is either common to both, or confined to Ephraim (see <a href="../../par/revelation/7-8.htm">Revelation 7:8</a>, and cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>). No spy was sent for the tribe of Levi, because it was now understood to have no territorial claims upon the land of promise, and to stand altogether by itself in relation to the national hopes and duties.

It is possible that Jephunneh may have been connected by descent or otherwise with this race; it is more likely that the similarity of name was accidental.

It was afterwards contracted into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span> (Jeshua; cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>), and has come to us in its current form through the Vulgate. The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, and so the name appears in the New Testament. It is an obvious difficulty that Joshua has already been called by his new name at <a href="../../par/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>, and in every other place where he has been mentioned. In fact he is only once elsewhere called Hoshea, and that in a place (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-44.htm">Deuteronomy 32:44</a>) where we should certainly not have expected it. There are two ways of explaining the difficulty, such as it is. We may suppose that the change of name was really made at this time, as the narrative seems (on the face of it) to assert; and then the previous mentions of Joshua by his subsequent and more familiar name will be cases of that anticipation which is so common in Scripture (cf., <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a> with <a href="../../par/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a>). Or we may suppose, what is perhaps more in harmony with the course of Joshua's life, that the change bad been already made at the time of the victory over Amalek. In that case the Vav consec. in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (and...  called) must be referred to the order of thought, not of time, and a sufficient reason must be shown for the interpolation of the statement in this particular place. Such a reason may fairly be found in the probable fact that the names of the spies were copied out of the tribal registers, and that Joshua still appeared under his original name in those registers. As to the significance of the change, it is not easy to estimate it aright. On the one hand, the sacred syllable entered into so many of the Jewish names that it could not have seemed a very marked change; on the other hand, the fact that our Saviour received the same name because he was our Saviour throws a halo of glory about it which we cannot ignore. In the Divine providence Hoshea became Joshua because he was destined to be the temporal saviour of his people, and to lead them into their promised rest.

The Negeb, meaning literally "the dryness," was the south-western district of Canaan, which bordered upon the desert, and partook more or less of its character. Except where springs existed, and irrigation could be carried out, it was unfit for settled habitation.

There seems to be but one marked natural feature which could have been chosen for that purpose - the broad sandy depression called the Wady Murreh, which divides the mountain mass of the Azazimeh from the Rakhmah plateau, the southern extremity of the highlands of Judah. The plain of Kudes communicates with it at its upper or western end, and maybe counted a part of it. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x3bf;&#x1f78;&#x3b2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;</span>. Hamath, now Hamah, was in Greek times Epiphaneia, on the Orontes, outside the limits of Jewish rule. The southern entrance to it lay between the ranges of Libanus and Anti-libanus (see note on Numbers 34:8). The Rehob here mentioned is not likely to have been either of the Rehobs in the territory of Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28-30</a>), but the Beth-rehob further to the east, and near to where Dan-Laish was afterwards built (<a href="../../par/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>). It lies on the route to Hamath, and was at one time a place of some importance in the possession of the Syrians (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>).

The Beni-Anak (Beni-Anakim in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>; Anakim in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>, &c.) were a tribe whose remote and perhaps legendary ancestor was Anak son of Arba (see on Joshua 14:15). These three chiefs of the Beni-Anak are said to have been expelled from Hebron fifty years later by Caleb (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-14.htm">Joshua 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-20.htm">Judges 1:20</a>). The gigantic size which the Anakim shared with the Emim and Rephaim, other remnants of the aboriginal inhabitants, may have been accompanied by remarkable longevity; or they may have been quite young at the time of this visit; or, finally, they may not have been individuals at all, but families or clans. <span class="cmt_word">Now Hebron was built seven years before Zean in Egypt.</span> Hebron was in existence at the time of Abraham. Zoan was Tanis, near the mouth of the eastern branch of the Nile (see on Psalm 78:12, 43). If it be true that the Pharaoh of the exodus had his royal residence at Zoan, Moses may have had access to the archives of the city, or he may have learnt the date of its foundation from the priests who gave him his Egyptian education. That there was any real connection between the two places is extremely problematical, nor is it possible to give any reason for the abrupt insertion here of a fragment of history so minute and in itself so unimportant. There is, however, no one but Moses to whom the statement can with any sort of likelihood be traced; a later writer could have had no authority for making the statement, and no possible reason for inventing it.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a></div><div class="verse">The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Amalekites.</span> These descendants of Esau (see on Genesis 36:12) formed wild roving bands, which (like the Bedouins of the present day) infested rather than inhabited the whole country between Judaea and Egypt, including the Negeb. They are not numbered among the inhabitants of Canaan proper. <span class="cmt_word">The Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</span> It is not easy to say in what sense the word "Canaanites" is used here. At one time it is the name of one tribe amongst many, all descended from Canaan, the son of Ham, which dwelt in the land of promise; at another time it is apparently synonymous with "Amorites," or rather includes both them and the allied tribes (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/judges/1-9.htm">Judges 1:9</a>). It is possible, though far from certain, that "Canaanites" in this place may mean "Phoenicians," since Sidon was the first-born of Canaan (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), and the northern portion of the maritime plain was certainly in their possession, and probably the upper part of the Ghor, or coast of Jordan. It would appear that the Philistines had not at this time made themselves masters of the plain, although they dwelt in some parts of it (see on Exodus 13:17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a></div><div class="verse">And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Caleb stilled the people.</span> That Caleb alone is named here, whereas Joshua is elsewhere joined with him in the matter (as in chapter Numbers 14:6, 30), has been considered strange; but it is not difficult to supply a probable explanation. Joshua was the special companion and minister of Moses, his <span class="accented">alter ego</span> in those things wherein he was employed: for that reason he may very well have given place to Caleb as a more impartial witness, and one more likely to be listened to in the present temper of the people; for it is evident from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, that that temper had already declared itself for evil (see on Numbers 14:24). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31</a></div><div class="verse">But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they <i>are</i> stronger than we.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they are stronger than we.</span> In point of numbers the enormous superiority of the Israelites over any combination likely to oppose them must have been evident to the most cowardly. But the existence of numerous walled and fortified towns was (apart from Divine aid) an almost insuperable obstacle to a people wholly ignorant of artillery or of siege operations; and the presence of giants was exceedingly terrifying in an age when battles were a series of personal encounters (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11, 24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a></div><div class="verse">And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, <i>is</i> a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it <i>are</i> men of a great stature.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof.</span> This cannot mean that the people died of starvation, pestilence, or other natural causes, which would have been contrary to facts and to their own report. It must mean that the population was continually changing through internecine wars, and the incursions of fresh tribes from the surrounding wastes. The history of Palestine from first to last testifies to the constant presence of this d anger. The remarkable variation in the lists of tribes inhabiting Canaan may be thus accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">All the</span> <span class="cmt_word">people... are men of great stature,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "men of measures.

The Nephilim are, without doubt, the primaeval tyrants mentioned under that name in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>. The renown of these sons of violence had come down from those dim ages, and the exaggerated fears of the spies saw them revived in the gigantic forms of the Beni-Anak. There is no certainty that the Nephilim had been giants, and no likelihood whatever that the Beni-Anak had any real connection with them. As grasshoppers. We have no means of judging of the actual size of these men, unless the height assigned to Goliath (six cubits and a span) be allowed to them. Probably men of this stature were quite exceptional even among the Anakim. The report of the spies was thoroughly false in effect, although founded on isolated facts. </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../numbers/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Numbers 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../numbers/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Numbers 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
