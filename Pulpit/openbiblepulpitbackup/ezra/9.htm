Ezra reached Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>), rested three days (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>), and on the fourth day of the same month made over the vessels to the temple authorities. It was not till the seventeenth day of the ninth month that, on Ezra's motion, the matter of the mixed marriages was taken in hand (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-8.htm">Ezra 10:8, 9</a>). Yet we cannot suppose that action was long delayed after the matter came to Ezra's knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">The princes</span>. The civil heads of the community, whom Ezra found at the head of affairs on his arrival, and whose authority he did not wholly supersede (see <a href="../../par/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the lands.</span> The idolatrous nations inhabiting the districts adjoining Palestine: Egyptians and Amorites on the south; Moabites and Ammonites on the east; Canaanites probably towards the north and the north-west. <span class="cmt_word">Doing according to their abominations.</span> Rather, "in respect of their abominations." The complaint was not so much that the Jews had as yet actually adopted idolatrous functions, as that they did not keep themselves wholly aloof from them. The foreign wives would introduce idolatrous rites into their very houses.

The "seed of Israel," however much it polluted itself by transgressions, was still "holy" by profession, by call, by obligation, by prophetic announcement. They were "a kingdom of priests, a holy nation" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>); bound to be "separated from all the people that were on the face of the earth" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-16.htm">Exodus 33:16</a>), and to keep themselves a "peculiar people." When they <span class="cmt_word">mingled themselves with the people of the</span> lands, they not only broke a positive command (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), but did their best to frustrate God's entire purpose in respect of them, and to render all that he had done for them of no effect. <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in the trespass.</span> "Princes and rulers" are here opposed to people of the middle and lower ranks. The upper classes, whether clerical or lay, had been the chief offenders (see <a href="../../par/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>); and compare the similar defection of Jews of the upper classes in Nehemiah's time (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4, 28</a>). EZRA'S ASTONISHMENT AND HORROR (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3, 4</a>). In Babylonia, whence Ezra had come, the inclination to intermarry with the heathen had not, it would seem, shown itself. Exiles in a foreign land naturally cling to each other under their adverse circumstances, and, moreover, being despised by those among whom they sojourn, are not readily accepted by them into social fellowship, much less into affinity and alliance. Thus the thing was to Ezra a new thing. His familiarity with the Law, and, perhaps we may add, his insight into the grounds upon which the Law upon this point was founded, caused him to view the matter as one of the gravest kind, and to feel shocked and horror-struck at what was told him respecting it. He showed his feelings with the usual openness and <span class="accented">abandon</span> of an Oriental: first rending both his outer and his inner garments, then tearing his hair and his beard, and finally" sitting down astonied," motionless and speechless, until the time of the evening sacrifice. Such a manifestation of horror and amazement was well calculated to impress and affect the sympathetic and ardent people over whom Providence had placed him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rent my garment and my mantle.</span> Rending the clothes was always, and still is, one of the commonest Oriental modes of showing grief. Reuben rent his clothes when his brothers sold Joseph to the Midianites, and Jacob did the same when he believed that Joseph was dead (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>). Job "rent his mantle" on learning the death of his sons and daughters (<a href="../../par/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>); and his friends "<span class="accented">rent</span> every one his mantle when they came to mourn with him and comfort him" (<a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11, 12</a>). Rent clothes indicated that a messenger was a messenger of woe (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>), or that a man had heard something that had greatly shocked him, and of which he wished to express his horror (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>). Ezra's action is of this last kind, expressive of horror more than of grief, but perhaps in some degree of grief also. <span class="cmt_word">And plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard.</span> These are somewhat unusual signs of grief among the Orientals, who were wont to shave the head in great mourning, but seldom tore the hair out by the roots. The practice is not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, excepting in the apocryphal books (1 Esdras 8:71; 2 Esdras 1:8; Apoc. <a href="../../par/esther/4-2.htm">Esther 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sat down astonied.</span> Compare <a href="../../par/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>, where the same verb is used in the same sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/9-4.htm">Ezra 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then were assembled unto me.</span> The open manifestation by Ezra of his grief and horror produced an immediate effect. A crowd assembled around him, attracted by the unusual sight - partly sympathizing, partly no doubt curious. <span class="cmt_word">Every one came</span> <span class="cmt_word">that trembled at the words of the God of Israel;</span> by which is meant not so much all God-fearing persons (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>) as all who were alarmed at the transgression of the commands of God (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-3.htm">Ezra 10:3</a>), and at the threats which the Law contained against transgressors (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of the transgression of those that had been carried away.</span> The transgression of "the children of the captivity" (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1</a>) - of those who had been removed to Babylon and had returned under Zerubbabel. <span class="cmt_word">I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.</span> As morning is the time for business in the East, we may assume that the princes had waited upon Ezra tolerably early in the day - before noon, at any rate - to communicate their intelligence. The evening sacrifice took place at three in the afternoon. Ezra must, therefore, either from the intensity of his own feelings or with the view of impressing the people, have "sat astonied" - speechless and motionless - for several hours. EZRA'S CONFESSION AND PRAYER TO GOD (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5-15</a>). The most remarkable feature of Ezra's confession is the thoroughness with which he identifies himself with his erring countrymen, blushes for their transgressions, and is ashamed for their misconduct. All their sins he appears to consider as his sins, all their disobedience as his disobedience, all their perils as his perils. Another striking feature is his sense of the exceeding sinfulness of the particular sin of the time (see vers. 6, 7, 10). He views it as a "great trespass" - one that "is grown up into the heavens" - which is equivalent to a complete forsaking of God's commandments, and on account of Which he and his people "cannot stand before" God. This feeling seems based partly on the nature of the sin itself (ver. 14), but also, and in an especial way, on a strong sense of the ingratitude shown by the people in turning from God so soon after he had forgiven their former sins against him, and allowed them to return from the captivity, rebuild the temple, and re-establish themselves as a nation. If after their deliverance they again fell away, the sin could not but be unpardonable; and the punishment to be expected was a final uprooting and destruction from which there could be no recovery (vers. 13, 14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness.</span> The time of sacrifice was the fittest time for prayer, especially for a prayer in which acknowledgment of sin was to form a large part. Sacrifice symbolized expiation; and Ezra probably felt that his supplication would be helped by the expiatory rite which was being performed at the time. He <span class="cmt_word">rent his garment and his mantle</span> a second time, as a renewed indication of sorrow, and with the view of impressing the people who "were assembled unto him" (ver. 4) the more, and stirring them up to penitence.
