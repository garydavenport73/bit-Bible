It is sufficient to understand the phrase as signifying that the measurements noted had a special relation to the entire breadth of the temple, here styled "tabernacle," or "tent," to indicate the covered portion of the edifice, which, in this respect, and in respect of its being the place of meeting between Jehovah and Israel, resembled the ancient sanctuary of the wilderness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the breadth of the door <i>was</i> ten cubits; and the sides of the door <i>were</i> five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breadth of the door</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the opening from the porch, was <span class="cmt_word">ten cubits</span>; whereas the door into the porch was eleven cubits (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>).

First, that of <span class="cmt_word">the post of the door</span> (the singular for the plural, meaning the post on either side of the doorway) <span class="cmt_word">two cubits</span>. Next, that of the door itself, which is given first as <span class="cmt_word">six</span> and second as <span class="cmt_word">seven cubits</span>. Kliefoth and Keil take the six as the height and the seven as the breadth of the entrance into the holy of holies; but as no other measurement of height occurs throughout this description, Dr. Currey regards "six" as the distance from "pest" to "post," and "seven" as the actual width of the door, each post projecting half a cubit beyond the hinge of the door, which opened inward. Ewald and Villalpandus, after the LXX., read, "the entrance six cubits and the flanks of the entrance seven cubits;" and these figures, 7 + 6 4- 7, certainly make up the breadth of the interior; only it is impossible to extract this meaning from the Hebrew without tampering with the text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-4.htm">Ezekiel 41:4</a></div><div class="verse">So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This <i>is</i> the most holy <i>place</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The holy of holies was an exact square of twenty cubits, as in the temple of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>), and to the measuring-man, who had turned himself round, lay along the whole breadth of the temple or holy place.

Its great thickness, six cubits, corresponded with and even surpassed the colossal proportions of architecture in the ancient East. The walls of Solomon's temple, though not mentioned in either Kings or Chronicles, could hardly have been less than four cubits thick (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>), and were probably more (Schurer). Like the Solomonic (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5-10</a>), the Ezekelian temple had <span class="cmt_word">side chambers</span>, which, like those of the earlier building, served as storehouses for priests' clothing, temple utensils, and temple treasures (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-1.htm">2 Chronicles 5:1</a>), and measured four cubits broad in the clear.

It is not needful to alter the text, as Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, and Ewald propose to do, in order to make it read, with the LXX., "chamber against chamber, thirty and (this) three times," on the ground that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is the preposition, because in Ezekiel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> often stands for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). How the chambers were arranged along the three sides is not stated; but most likely there were twelve threes on each of the longer sides, the north and the south, and six threes on the shorter or western side. Like the chambers in Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). those in Ezekiel's were not fastened to "the wall of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the temple proper; the only question is whether they were built against the temple wall, as Kliefoth, Keil, Smend, and Schroder suppose, or, as Ewald and Dr. Currey seem to think, against another wall, five cubits thick (ver. 9), which ran parallel to the temple wall, and which, having been built expressly for the support of the side chambers, might properly enough be said to be "of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> belonging to it. In the former case the chambers would doubtless be fastened to the temple wall by means of "ledges," "holds," "rebates," as in the temple of Solomon: in the latter case, as Ewald translates, there would be "a light passage between the wall of the house and the side chambers around." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-7.htm">Ezekiel 41:7</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>there was</i> an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house <i>was still</i> upward, and so increased <i>from</i> the lowest <i>chamber</i> to the highest by the midst.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In the side chambers <span class="cmt_word">an enlarging</span> took place as they went up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the floorage of the second story exceeded that of the first, and the floorage of the third that of the second; though how this was effected can only be conjectured. If the chambers were built against the temple wall, then probably the wall at each story went in, say a cubit or a cubit and a half from the outside, so as to admit the beams; or, if the chambers were built against an outside wall, a similar recession of the wall from the inside may have taken place. In either ease, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (interior) <span class="cmt_word">breadth of the house</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the side chambers, would be <span class="cmt_word">upward</span>, and would increase from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. Plumptre, after Kliefoth, suggests that the increasing size of the chambers in the three stories may have been due to projecting galleries. Ewald, taking "house" as "the temple," supposes that it gradually became bigger. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> broader, as it rose, which could be the case only if the side chambers were built against the temple wall, and the increased width of the stories was scoured By projecting galleries or corridors. Greater obscurity attaches to the second clause, <span class="cmt_word">and a winding about still upward to the side chambers</span>, which the Authorized Version and some expositors regard as an indication that Ezekiel's temple had a spiral staircase like that in Solomon's temple (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>); and probably some such mode of passing from story to story did exist in Ezekiel's temple; yet the clause, when properly rendered, does not refer to this. The Revised Version reads, "And the side chambers were broader as they encompassed <span class="accented">the house</span> higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house <span class="accented">continued</span> upward; and so one went up (most likely by a spiral stair) from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Ezekiel 41:8</a></div><div class="verse">I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers <i>were</i> a full reed of six great cubits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> explains that "the house" did not stand upon the level ground, but, like many temple buildings in antiquity (see Schurer, in Riehm's 'Handworterbuch,' art. "Tern. pel Salerno"), <span class="cmt_word">upon a height</span> - or, <span class="accented">raised basement</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">round about</span>, which agrees with the statement in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> that the temple was approached by means of a stair. In consequence of this, the foundations of the side chambers were <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">full reed of six great cubits</span>; or, <span class="accented">of six cubits to the joining</span> (Revised Version); "six cubits to the story" (Ewald); literally, <span class="accented">six cubits to the armpit</span>. This can hardly mean six cubits each equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, which would be a new definition of the length of the reed; but as Havernick and Kliefoth propose, must be taken as an architectural term indicative of the point where one portion of the building joined on to another. Accordingly, by most interpreters the six cubits are considered to be a statement of the height of the ceiling above the floor in each story, which would give an elevation of eighteen cubits for the three stories; but probably they mark only the height of the temple and side chamber basis above the ground. Kliefoth includes both views, and obtains an altitude of twenty-four cubits from the ground to the temple roof. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-9.htm">Ezekiel 41:9</a></div><div class="verse">The thickness of the wall, which <i>was</i> for the side chamber without, <i>was</i> five cubits: and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> left <i>was</i> the place of the side chambers that <i>were</i> within.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers on the outside</span>, is next mentioned as having been <span class="cmt_word">five cubits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the same as the breadth of the wall of the porch (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>), but one cubit thinner than that of the temple (ver. 5). The clause which follows is obscure. By <span class="accented">that <span class="cmt_word"></span>which</span> <span class="accented">was <span class="cmt_word"></span>left</span>, the Authorized and Revised Versions understand <span class="cmt_word">the place of the side chambers that were within</span> - or, <span class="accented">that belonged to the house</span> (Revised Version)  - without intending to assert that the whole space left, which was five cubits (ver. 11), was occupied by the side chambers, which were only four cubits broad (ver. 5). Accepting these measurements, Kliefoth and Keil regard the free space as a walk of five cubits broad on the outside of the side chambers. Ewald, and Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' place the five cubits between the temple wall and the side chambers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-10.htm">Ezekiel 41:10</a></div><div class="verse">And between the chambers <i>was</i> the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Ewald and Smend, following the LXX., combine vers.; 9 and 10 thus: "And that which was left between the side chambers of the house and the cells (along the inner court wall) was twenty cubits round about the house on every side." Interpreters who reject this combination of the verses explain ver. 10 as a statement of the distance between the outside wall of the side chambers and the cells of the inner court.

The corridor into which the chambers opened - whether between them and the house (Ewald, Currey) or between them and an outside wall (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Keil) - was five cubits broad.

Behind Solomon's temple lay a similar space (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-18.htm">1 Chronicles 26:18</a>), with buildings upon it and a separate way out; and as the name gizrah appears to convey the <span class="accented">notion</span> of something that required to be kept apart and removed from the sacred precincts, the opinion of Kliefoth is probably correct that "this space with its buildings was to be used for the reception of all refuse, sweepings, all kinds of rubbish - in brief, of everything that was separated or rejected when the holy service was performed in the temple, and that this was the reason why it received the name of 'the separate place.'

Each cherub had two of its four faces exhibited (since four could not be conveniently represented on a plain surface)  - a man's face (symbolizing the rational creation) directed towards the palm tree on one side, and a young lion's face (symbolizing the irrational creation) turned towards the palm tree on the other side. This particular style of ornamentation was employed <span class="cmt_word">from the ground unto above the door</span>, which Plumptre interprets as an indication of the height of the palm trees and cherubic figures, but which probably meant the same thing as the preceding clause, "through- all the house round about." Cherubic figures formed part of the adornment of the tabernacle curtains (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/36-8.htm">Exodus 36:8</a>).

The remaining clauses ought to read as in the Revised Version, "As for the face of the sanctuary, the appearance <span class="accented">thereof</span> was as the appearance <span class="accented">of the temple</span>," the sanctuary being the holy of holies as distinguished from the holy place or the house as a whole, The precise force of the last words, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">appearance as the appearance</span>, is supposed by Kliefoth and Keil to be that the sanctuary door, like that of the temple, had square pests; by Ewald, that it appeared to be what it really was; by Plumptre, that the appearance was like that he (Ezekiel) had formerly described: by Currey, that the appearance in this vision was the same as in the other visions, and as in the actual temple (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>). Something can be said for each of these attempts to elucidate a dark phrase. Smend and Hitzig, follow the LXX. in connecting the last clause of ver. 21 with ver. 22 in this fashion, "And in front of the holy place was an appearance like the sight of a wooden altar." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a></div><div class="verse">The altar of wood <i>was</i> three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, <i>were</i> of wood: and he said unto me, This <i>is</i> the table that <i>is</i> before the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The altar.</span> This was the altar of incense (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>, etc.), which stood in the holy place in contradistinction to the altar of burnt offering, which was located in the outer court. The altar of burnt offering in Solomon's temple was of brass (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), and in the tabernacle of shittim wood (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>); the altar of incense in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>) and in Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>) was constructed of wood overlaid with gold, but in this temple only of wood. Plumptre, commenting on this, writes, "Possibly Ezekiel shared the feelings of Daniel (Daniel 9:25), that the rebuilding would be 'in troublous times,' and did not contemplate an abundance of gold as likely to be the outcome of the scant offerings of an impoverished people." The dimensions of this altar in the tabernacle were two cubits high and one cubit long and broad; in the Solomonic temple, though not stated, they were probably the same as in the tabernacle; in Ezekiel's temple they were three cubits high, two cubits long (and probably two cubits broad). <span class="cmt_word">The corners of the altar</span> were most likely "the horns, or horn-shaped points projecting at the cornets." <span class="cmt_word">The length.</span> Ewald, Keil, Smend, and others, after the LXX., change into "base," "stand," or "pedestal," on the  ground that the length has been already mentioned, and that one does not usually speak of a length being of wood; but it does not strike one as peculiarly objectionable to say that the altar had corner pieces, a length, and walls (or sides) of wood, meaning thereby to intimate that it was wholly constructed of timber. When the prophet's attention had been directed to it, the guide <span class="accented">who</span> accompanied him observed, <span class="cmt_word">This is the table that is before the Lord</span>, not because, as Bottcher conjectured, the altar was regarded as including the table of showbread, but because in the Law the offerings laid upon the altar had been spoken of as the bread of God (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6, 8, 17, 21, 22</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>); and because in this vision table and altar appear to be used inter-changeably (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>).

Again as in the Solomonic edifice (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>, etc.), the holy place and the holy of holies had two doors; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> each had one door composed of two turning (or, folding) leaves, ornamented, like the walls of the house, with carvings of cherubim and palms. On the face of the porch without were <span class="cmt_word">thick planks</span>, by which Ewald understands "foliage" or "leafwork," but which, with greater likelihood, were either as Keil renders, "moldings of wood" for the threshold; or "cornicings," as Kliefoth translates; if not, as Smend suggests, projecting beams to afford shelter to one standing in the porch; or as Hengstenberg and Plumptre say, "steps." The last verse states that narrow or closed (as in ver. 16) windows admitted light into the porch, while carvings of palm trees adorned its walls on each side. The cherubic figures, Plumptre hints, were absent, because the porch was a place of less sanctity than the temple. Hengstenberg notes that the words, "thick planks," "thick beams," or "steps," as he translates, fitly close this description, "as placing the extreme east over against the extreme west with which it began." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
