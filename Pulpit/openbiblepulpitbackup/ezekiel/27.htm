The dirge over the merchant-city that follows, the doom <span class="accented">sic transit gloria mundi</span>, worked out with a fullness of detail which reminds us of the Homeric catalogue of ships ('Iliad,' 2:484-770), is almost, if not altogether, without a parallel in the history of literature. It can scarcely have rested on anything but personal knowledge. Ezekiel, we must believe, had, at some time or other in his life, trod the sinful streets of the great city, and noted the mingled crowd of many nations and in many costumes that he met there, just as we infer from  Dante's vivid description of the dockyards of Venice ('Inf.,' 21:7-15) that he had visited that city. Apart from its poetic or prophetic interest, it is for us almost the <span class="accented">locus classicus</span> as to the geography and commerce of that old world of which Tyre was in some sense the center. We may compare it, from that point of view, with the ethnological statements in <a href="../../par/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>; just as, from the standpoint of prophecy, it has to be compared with Isaiah's "burden" against Babylon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13, 14</a>.), and with St. John's representation of Rome as the spiritual Babylon of the Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, <i>which art</i> a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <i>am</i> of perfect beauty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - We begin with the picture of the city, <span class="cmt_word">situate at the entry</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">entries</span>), or harbors of the sea. Of these Tyro had two - the northern, known as the Sidonian; the southern, as the Egyptian. There she dwelt, <span class="cmt_word">a merchant of the peoples</span>, that came, in the wider sense of the word (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>), from the <span class="cmt_word">isles</span> of the Mediterranean. <span class="cmt_word">I am perfect in beauty.</span> The boast here put into the mouth of the city appears afterwards as the utterance of its ruler, or as applied to him (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2, 15-17</a>). We are reminded of Genoa, <span class="accented">la superba</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a></div><div class="verse">Thy borders <i>are</i> in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the seas</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the heart</span> (Revised Version). The words were true of the island-city, but Ezekiel has already present to his thoughts the idealized picture of the city under the figure of its stateliest ship. The builders are ship-builders, and in the verses that follow we have a picture of the Bucentaur of the Venice of the ancient world. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a></div><div class="verse">They have made all thy <i>ship</i> boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fir trees of Senti</span>. The name appears in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> and <a href="../../par/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> as <span class="accented">Shenir</span>; in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a> it is spelt as here. From <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> we learn that it was the Amorite name for Hermon, as Sirion was the Sidonian name. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a> Hiram King of Tyro appears as supplying Solomon with the fir and cedar timber mentioned here for the erection of his palace, the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>). The fir tree was more commonly used for ships, the cedar for houses (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:444). The Hebrew for "boards" is unique in its form as a plural with a dual form superadded to indicate that each plank had its counterpart on the other side of the ship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Of</i> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <i>of</i> ivory, <i>brought</i> out of the isles of Chittim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The high plateau of Bashan, the region east of the sea of Galilee and the Jordan, now known as the Hauran, was famous then, as it is now, for its oak forests and its wild cattle (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The company of the Ashurites</span>, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood</span>. The Authorized Version follows the present Hebrew text, but the name of the nation there is not the same as that of the Assyrians, and corresponds with the Ashurites of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9</a> - an obscure tribe of Canaanites, possibly identical with the Geshurites. A difference of punctuation or spelling (<span class="accented">Bithasshurim</span> for <span class="accented">Bath-asshu-rim</span>) gives the meaning which the Revised Version follows; <span class="accented">thasshur</span> being used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a> and Isaiah 60:13 for the box tree, or perhaps cypress, or larch, as forming part of the glory of Lebanon. The use of ivory in ship or house building seems to have been one of the arts for which Tyre was famous. So we have the ivory palace of Ahab, after he had married his Sidonian queen (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>) and those of the monarch who had married a Tyrian princess in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a> (see also <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). For the use of such inlaid wood in later times, see Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:137. Either the ivory or the wood is said to come from <span class="cmt_word">the isles of Chittim</span>. The word was about as wide in its use as the "Indies" in the time of Elizabeth. Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) identifies it with Cyprus, which perhaps retains a memorial of it in Citium. The Vulgate, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>, identifies it here with Italy, and in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> translates the "ships of Chittim" as <span class="accented">trieres et Romani</span>, while in 1 Macc. 1:1, it is used of Greece as including Macedonia. In <a href="../../par/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> the Kittim appear as descended from Javan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are classed as Greeks or Ionians. The ivory which the Tyrians used probably came from Northern Africa, and may have been supplied through Carthage or other Phoenician colonies. A supply may have come also from Ethiopia through Egypt, or from the Red Sea ports, with which the Phoenicians carried on a trade with Arabia. Inlaid ivory-work, sometimes in wood, sometimes with enamel, is found both in  Egyptian and Assyrian remains ('Dict. Bible,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. "Ivory"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a></div><div class="verse">Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the fine linen of Egypt</span>, the Byssus famous in its commerce, see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/26-36.htm">Exodus 26:36</a>. This, which took the place of the coarse canvas of the common <span class="accented">ships</span>, was made more magnificent by being embroidered with purple or crimson, with gold borders. The ship of Antony and Cleopatra had purple sails, which, as they swelled out with the wind, served as a banner. The ancient ships had no flags or pennons. So the Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">of fine linen, was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign</span>. The word for "sail" in the Authorized Version is rendered" banner" in <a href="../../par/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>, and "ensign" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The isles of Elishah.</span> The name appears in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> as one of the sons of Javan. It has been identified, on the ground chiefly of similarity of sound, with Ells, Hellas, or AEolia. Laconia has been suggested as being famous for the murex which supplied the purple dye. The Targum gives Italy. Sicily also has been conjectured. The murex is common all over the Mediterranean, but Cythera and Abydos are named as having been specially famous for it. Probably, as in the case of "Chittim," the word was used with considerable latitude. The latter clause of the verse describes the awning over the deck of the queenly ship. Was Ezekiel describing what he had actually seen in the state-ship of Tyro? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a></div><div class="verse">The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise <i>men</i>, O Tyrus, <i>that</i> were in thee, were thy pilots.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The two cities are named as tributaries of Tyro from which she drew her sailors, the Tyrians themselves acting as captains and pilots. <span class="cmt_word">Zidon</span> (now <span class="accented">Saida</span>) is named in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a> as the firstborn of Canaan, and was older than Tyre itself (<a href="../../par/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Arvad</span> is identified with the Greek Aradus, the modern <span class="accented">Ruad</span>, an island about two miles from the coast, about two miles north of the mouth of the river Eleutheros (<span class="accented">Nahr-el-Kebir</span>). It is scarcely a mile in circumference, but was prominent enough to be named here and in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-16.htm">1 Chronicles 1:16</a>. Opposite to it on the mainland was the town of Antaradus. <span class="cmt_word">For mariners</span>, the Revised Version gives <span class="accented">rowers</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a></div><div class="verse">The ancients of Gebal and the wise <i>men</i> thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ancients of Gebal</span>. The word is used in the sense of "elders" or "senators," the governing body. Gebal, for which the LXX. gives <span class="accented">Biblii</span>, is identified with the Greek Byblus. The name appears in <a href="../../par/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a> in connection, among other nations, with Tyre and Asshur, as allied with them against Israel; in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a> as near Lebanon and Hermon; in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a> (margin Revised Version) as among the stonemasons who worked with Hiram's builders. Byblus was situated on an eminence overlooking the river Adonis between Beirut and Tripoli. Its modern name, <span class="accented">Gebail</span>, retains the old Semitic form, and its ruins abound in marble and granite columns of Phoenician and Egyptian workmanship. The work of the <span class="cmt_word">caulkers</span> was to stop the chinks of the ship, and the men of Gebal appear to have been especially skilful in this. We note that the metaphor of the ship falls into the background in the latter clause of the verse, and does not appear again. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a></div><div class="verse">They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Persia</span>. The name does not meet us in any Old Testament book before the exile, Elam taking its place. It was just about the time that Ezekiel wrote that the Persians were becoming conspicuous through their alliance with the Modes. So we find it again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-28.htm">Daniel 5:28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-20.htm">2 Chronicles 36:20, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-5.htm">Ezra 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>. Here they are named as mercenaries in the Tyrian army. <span class="cmt_word">Lud</span>. The LXX. and the Vulgate, led by the similarity of sound, give <span class="accented">Lydians</span>. In <a href="../../par/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13</a> the Ludim appear as descendants of Mizraim, while Lud in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a> is joined with Elam and Asshur as among the sons of Shem. Its combination with "Phut" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Libya) here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> is in favor of its referring to an African nation (comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Phut</span>. Both the LXX. and the Vulgate give <span class="accented">Libyans</span>. In <a href="../../par/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a> the name is joined with Cash and Mizraim. The Lubim (Libyans) are named as forming part of Shishak's army in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>, and in <a href="../../par/nahum/3-9.htm">Nahum 3:9</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> as closely allied with the Egyptians. Ezekiel names Phut again as sharing in the fall of Tyre (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>), and as serving in the army of Gog (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-5.htm">Ezekiel 38:5</a>). Mr. R. S. Peele is inclined to identify them with the Nubians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a></div><div class="verse">The men of Arvad with thine army <i>were</i> upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - (For <span class="cmt_word">Arvad</span>, see Ver. 8.) <span class="cmt_word">Gammadim</span>. The LXX. translates "guards" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Pygmies</span>, probably as connecting the name with <span class="accented">Gamad</span> (equivalent to "a cubit"). The Targum gives "watchmen;" Gesenius, "warriors:" Hitzig, "deserters." The name probably indicates that they were the flower of the Tyrian army - the life-guards (like the "Immortals" of the Persians) of the merchant-city. On the whole, we must leave the problem as one that we have no data for solving. The grouping with Arvad, however, suggests a Syrian or Phoenician tribe. <span class="cmt_word">They hanged their shields</span>. The custom seems to have been specially Phoenician. Solomon introduced it at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>). The sight of the walls thus decorated, the shields being sometimes gilt or painted, must have been sufficiently striking to warrant Ezekiel's phrase that thus the beauty of the city was "made  perfect" by it. The custom reappears in 1 Macc. 4:57. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a></div><div class="verse">Tarshish <i>was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all <i>kind of</i> riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tarahish</span>. The description of the city is followed by a <span class="accented">catalogue raisonnee</span> of the countries with which she traded. Here we are on more certain ground, there being a general consensus that Tarshish, the Greek Tartessus, indicates the coast of Spain, which was pre-eminent in the ancient world for the metals named (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>). The ships of Tarshish (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>) were the larger merchant-vessels that were made for this distant traffic. Like all such names, it was probably used with considerable latitude, and it is worth noting that both the LXX. and the Vulgate give <span class="accented">Carthaginians</span>. Probably the chief Phoenician colonies in Spain, notably, of course, Carthago Nova, were offshoots from Carthage, in which, by the way, we trace the old Hebrew <span class="accented">Kirjath</span> (equivalent to "city"). <span class="cmt_word">Traded in thy fairs</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">traded for thy wares</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they bartered their mineral treasures for the goods brought by the Tyrian merchants. The same Hebrew word appears in Vers. 14, 16, 19, 22, 23, but is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, and may have been a technical word in Tyrian commerce. The LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">nundinae</span>, which seems to have suggested the Revised Version.

The two names probably represented the tribes on the southeast coast of the Black Sea. Here the chief traffic was in slaves, the Tyrian traders probably buying them in exchange for their manufactured goods, and selling them to the cities of Greece as well as Phoenicia. In Greek history the names appear as Tibaroni and Moschi (Herod., 3:94; Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 5:5. 2, <span class="accented">etal</span>.). In Joel 4:6 Tyriaus are represented as selling Israelites as slaves in Greek cities (Hebrew "sons of Javan").
