All was human and of the earth. Not a single fact in the future, not a single eternal law governing both the future and the past, was brought to light by it. To one who was conscious that he had a message which he had not devised himself, and which he had not been taught by men (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>); that he had no selfish by-ends in what he said and did; that he was risking peace, reputation, life itself, for the truth revealed to him, - nothing could be more repulsive than this claim to have seen a vision of Jehovah, by men who bad in reality <span class="cmt_word">seen nothing</span>.

So the false prophets were crafty, laid waste the vineyard of the Lord of hosts (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>), made their profit out of the ruin of Israel, and made that ruin worse. The 'Reineke Fuchs,' in satirizing the monks and priests of the sixteenth century under the same comparison, presents a curious, though probably unconscious,  analogue. In <a href="../../par/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a> wolves appear as the types of the false prophet.

The hedge of the vineyard of Israel had been broken through (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5</a>), and they had done nothing to restore it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>). The day of battle, the day of the Lord, had come, and they were betraying the people instead of helping.

What had been a statement appears as a question to which there could be but one answer. The prophet, as it were, cross examines his rivals. Could they deny the charge? Was not every word of it true? Then, after the statement of the sin of the false prophets, comes the proclamation of the punishment. The hand of Jehovah would be upon them for evil and not for good. <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of my people.</span> The Hebrew word indicates not a large popular gathering, but a secret council of those who deliberate together to carry out their plans (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). The prophets who had acted together, and been looked up to by the people as forming such a council, should lose that position of authority. The words that follow point to a yet lower degradation. They should be in the strictest sense of the word excommunicated. The city of Jerusalem, perhaps every city of Judah, had its register of citizens. In such a register were inscribed also the names of proselytes of other races (<a href="../../par/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>), and so men came to think of a like register as kept by the King of kings, containing the names of those who were heirs of the "life" of the true Israel (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). In neither of those registers, the earthly and the heavenly (but stress is probably laid upon the former), shall the false prophets find a place. <a href="../../par/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a> gives an example of the use made of such registers on the return from the Captivity. One notes the contrast between the "<span class="accented">my</span> people" which recognizes Israel as still the heritage of Jehovah, and the "<span class="accented">thy</span> people" used in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a> of the rebellious house of the Captivity. For the false prophets there should be no return to the <span class="cmt_word">land of Israel</span> such as that which the prophet anticipated for the faithful and the penitent (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). Here there is no specific mention of the name being struck out. The prophet contemplates a new register, in which their names will never even have appeared.

Some scheme is devised, an Egyptian alliance or the like, to which the people look for safety. It is, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, a "slight wall," such as was used for partition walls inside houses. They make it do duty as an outside wall (<span class="accented">kir</span> in ver. 12). It has no sure "footings," and materials and workmanship are alike defective. The false prophets would smear it over <span class="cmt_word">with untempered</span> mortar (the Hebrew word is found only here and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-28.htm">Ezekiel 22:28</a>, and is probably an example of Ezekiel's acquaintance with the technical vocabulary of his time) - with a stucco or plaster, which is hardly better than whitewash (compare the "whitened" or plastered wall or sepulchre of <a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), used to hide its detects and give it a semblance of solidity.

And when the disaster comes men will turn to those who professed to be master builders and repairers of the breach, with derision, and ask, "Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed?" And then men shall see that through all this it is Jehovah's hand that has been working. It is he who "rends" the wall; he who "brings it down to the ground;" he who "accomplishes his wrath" (vers. 13-15). That shall be the end of the false "visions of peace."

The section which follows (vers. 17-23) throws an interesting side light on the position of women in the religious life of Israel. For good as for evil, their influence was stronger there than in most other nations. Miriam had led the way (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>), and had been followed by Deborah (<a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). Huldah had been almost as prominent in Josiah's reformation as Hilkiah the high priest (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14-20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>). It was but natural that there should be women on the other side also, guiding their own sex; and it is probable that Ezekiel had in his thoughts some special leaders who headed the women of Jerusalem in their opposition to Jeremiah, as afterwards at Pathros (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>). So, later on, we have the prophetess Noadiah heading the opposition to Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and in the New Testament, on the one hand, Anns (<a href="../../par/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) and the daughters of Philip (<a href="../../par/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), and on the other, the ill-regulated prophetesses of Corinth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>) and the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the <i>women</i> that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls!

In both cases there are the difficulties inseparable from the fact that he had seen what he describes, and that we have not; and that he uses words which were familiar enough then, but are now found nowhere else. so that (as in the case of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>) we have to guess their meaning. The picture which he draws of a false prophetess is obviously taken from the life, and the dress, we can scarcely doubt, was one that belonged to her calling. The word for "sew" meets us in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>; and the English is an adequate rendering. For the word rendered "pillows," the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">pulvilli</span> (equivalent to "cushions"). The word here obviously denotes an article of dress, something fastened to the arms. For <span class="cmt_word">arm-holes</span> <span class="accented">read joints of the two hoods</span>, which may mean either knuckles, wrists, or (as in the Revised Version) elbows. Possibly these may have been, like the phylacteries of <a href="../../par/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>, cases containing charms or incantations, and used as amulets. Something analogous to, if not identical with, these ornaments, is found in the "seeress wreaths," and "divining garments" of Cassandra (AEsch., 'Agamemnon,' 1237-1242), and in the "garlands" or "fillets" of the Pythian priestess in AEsch., 'Eumeu.,' 39. By some writers (Havernick) the word has been taken, as, perhaps, in the Authorized Version, for "pillows" in the larger sense, either literally as used in wanton luxury, like the "tapestry" of <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, or figuratively, like the "wall" of the preceding section, for counsels that lulled the conscience into the slumber of a false security. Strangely enough, the Hebrew noun rendered "arm-holes" has the pronominal suffix "<span class="accented">my</span> arms<span class="accented"></span>," or "<span class="accented">my</span> hands." Keil accepts this rendering, and explains it as meaning that the prophetesses sought to "bind the arms," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to restrain the power of Jehovah. On the whole, it is safer to follow Ewald and Hitzig, as I have done above. <span class="cmt_word">Make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature.</span> The word for "kerchiefs" is again unique, but is, perhaps, a variant of the word in <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, and rendered "wimples" in the Authorized Version. There is a fair consensus of interpretations that it means, as "kerchief" means, some covering for the head, a veil that hangs down over it, like the Spanish mantilla. Its use is, perhaps, explained by the words that follow, which suggest that the veils were not worn by the prophetesses themselves, but by those who came to consult them. The former had, as it were, a whole wardrobe of such veils adapted to persons of various heights, so that in all cases it shrouded their whole form. We may, perhaps, read between the lines the thought that their utterances, like their veils, were adapted to suit every age and every taste. Analogous usages present themselves in the <span class="accented">tallith</span> of later Judaism, and the veil worn by the Roman augurs. Ezekiel paints, we may believe, what he had seen. And in those veils he had seen a net cast over the victims of the false prophetesses, a snare from which they could not escape. <span class="cmt_word">Will ye hunt,</span> etc.? The question (that form is preferable to the affirmative of the margin of the Revised Version) is one of burning indignation. Omitting the words, "that come" (which have nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to them), the second clause will run, "Will ye make your own souls live?" and the question is explained by what follows. The prophetesses were living upon the credulity of the victims over whom they cast their nets.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a></div><div class="verse">And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear <i>your</i> lies?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will ye pollute me</span>, etc.? rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">ye have profaned</span>, the interrogative form not being continued in the Hebrew. The prophet dwells with scorn on the miserable pay for which the prophetesses were guilty of so great a sin. Not for rewards of divination, like those of Balsam (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>), but for gifts like those bestowed on the harlot or the beggar (l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread</span> - they plied their wretched trade. For examples of the lower gifts in kind offered to prophets, compare those of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a>), of Jeroboam's wife (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>), the false prophets in <a href="../../par/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>. And they did this in direct opposition to the will of Jehovah. They "slew," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> drew on to destruction, the souls that were meant for life. They "saved the souls alive," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "their own, which were worthy of death." That was the outcome of their "lying" divinations.

So the threat that follows, that the amulets should be torn off and the veil rent, is practically equivalent to the promise that the victims should be "delivered out of the snare of the fowler" (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>). They should no longer he in the power of those who traded on their credulity. They too shall know that he who speaks is indeed Jehovah.
