<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put forth a riddle,</span> etc. Again there is an interval of silence, till another theme is suggested to the prophet's mind and worked out elaborately. This he describes as a "riddle" (same word as the "dark speeches" of <a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>, the "hard questions" of <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>). It will task the ingenuity of his hearers or readers to interpret it, and so he subjoins (vers. 12-24) the interpretation. That interpretation enables us to fix the occasion and the date of the prophecy. It was the time when Zedekiah was seeking to strengthen himself against Nebuchadnezzar by an Egyptian alliance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The eagle with <span class="cmt_word">great wings and long pinions</span> (Revised Version) probably the golden eagle, the largest species of the genus - stands for Nebuchadnezzar, as it does in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> the "ravenous bird" represents Cyrus. Possibly the eagle head of the Assyrian god Nisroch (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>) may have impressed the symbolism on Ezekiel's mind. A doubtful etymology gives "the great eagle" as the meaning of <span class="accented">Nisroch</span>. The <span class="cmt_word">divers colours</span> indicate the variety of the nations under the king's sway (<a href="../../par/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>: 4:1). If the cedar was chosen to t,e the symbol of the monarchy of Judah, then it followed that Lebanon, as the special home of the cedar, should take its place in the parable. Possibly the fact that one of the stateliest palaces of Solomon was known as the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17, 21</a>) may have made the symbolism specially suggestive. The word for highest branch is peculiar to Ezekiel (here and in ver. 22). The branch so carried off was carried into "a land of traffick" (Hebrew, LXX., and Vulgate, "a land of Canaan," the word being generalized  in its meaning, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to Babylon, as pre-eminently the merchant city of the time. This, of course, refers to Nebuchadnezzar's deportation of Jeconiah and the more eminent citizens of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8-15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed <i>it</i> by great waters, <i>and</i> set it <i>as</i> a willow tree.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seed of the land</span> is Zedekiah, who was made king by Nebuchadnezzar in Jeconiah's place. The imagery of the <span class="cmt_word">willow</span> (the Hebrew word occurs here only) seems suggested by Ezekiel's surroundings. No tree could stand out in greater contrast to the cedar of Lebanon than the willows which he saw growing by the waters of Babylon (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>, though the word is different). The choice of the willow determined the rest of the imagery, and the <span class="cmt_word">fruitful field</span> and the great or "many" (Revised Version) waters represent Judah, possibly with reference to its being in its measure a "land of brooks of waters," of "fountains and depths," of "wheat and barley and wine" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10-12</a>). The kingdom of Zedekiah, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, was left with sufficient elements for material prosperity. That prosperity is indicated in ver. 6 by the fact that the willow became a vine. It was of "low stature," indeed, trailing on the ground. It could not claim the greatness of an independent kingdom. Its branches turned toward the planter (ver. 6); its roots were under him. It acknowledged, that is, Nebuchadnezzar's suzerainty, and so, had things continued as they were, it might have prospered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-7.htm">Ezekiel 17:7</a></div><div class="verse">There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The other</span> <span class="cmt_word">great eagle</span> is, of course, Egypt, then under Apries, or Pharaoh-Hophra (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>). We note the absence of the "long pinions" and the "many colours" of the first eagle. Egypt was not so strong, nor did her sway extend over so great a variety of nations as Babylon. To that eagle the vine bent its roots, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, as in ver. 15, Zedekiah courted the alliance of Pharaoh (Apries), and trusted in his chariots, he was to <span class="cmt_word">water the vine,</span> which so turned to him <span class="cmt_word">from the beds of her plantation</span> (Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-8.htm">Ezekiel 17:8</a></div><div class="verse">It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Ezekiel repeats, as justifying Nebuchadnezzar's action, that his first intention had been to leave Zedekiah under conditions which would have given his kingdom a fair measure of prosperity. The vine might have borne fruit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The prophet, like his contemporary Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>), like his predecessor Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>), is against this policy of an Egyptian alliance. The question which he asks, as the prophet of Jehovah, implies an answer in the negative. The doom of failure was written on all such projects. The <span class="cmt_word">he</span> of the next question is not Nebuchadnezzar, but indefinite, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For leaves of her spring,</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">fresh springing leaves</span>; or, <span class="accented">the leaves of her sprouting</span>. The Authorized Version and the Revised Version of the last clause seems to assert that Nebuchadnezzar would have an easy victory. It would not take <span class="cmt_word">great power or much</span> <span class="cmt_word">people</span> to pluck up such a vine from its roots. I adopt, with Keil and Hitzig, the rendering, <span class="accented">not with great power or much people will men be able to raise it up from its roots</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. no forces of Egypt or other allies should be able to restore Judah from its ruins. Its fall was, for the time, irretrievable (comp. ver. 17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, behold, <i>being</i> planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The question, <span class="cmt_word">Shall it prosper?</span> comes with all the emphasis of iteration. The east wind is, as elsewhere, the symbol of scorching and devastating power (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>). For <span class="cmt_word">furrows</span>, read <span class="accented">beds</span>, with Revised Version. In the case of the Chaldeans, who came from the east, there was a special appropriateness in the symbolism. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-11.htm">Ezekiel 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">

Ezekiel, after the pause implied in ver. 11, now becomes its interpreter. And that interpretation is to be addressed to the "rebellious house" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3, 6</a>) among whom he lived. Probably even among the exiles of Tel-Abib there were some who cherished hopes of the success of the Egyptian alliance, and of the downfall of the power of Babylon as its outcome. The tenses are better in the indefinite past - "came," "took," "brought," and so on in ver. 13. The history of Jeconiah's deportation and of Zedekiah's oath of fealty (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>) is recapitulated. He dwells specially on the fact that the <span class="cmt_word">mighty of the land</span> had been carried off with Jecoutah. It was Nebuchadnezzar's policy to deprive the kingdom of all its elements of strength - to leave it "bare." Even masons. smiths, and carpenters were carried off, lest they should be used for warlike preparations (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>). It could not lift itself up. It was enough if "by keeping its covenant" it was allowed to stand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a></div><div class="verse">And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-14.htm">Ezekiel 17:14</a></div><div class="verse">That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, <i>but</i> that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a></div><div class="verse">But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such <i>things</i>? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they might give him horses.</span> The "chariots and horses" of Egypt seem, throughout its whole history, to have been its chief element of strength. See for the time of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>), of Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>), of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>: 36:9). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he prosper?</span> What had been asked in the parable is asked also, in identical terms, in the interpretation. Ezekiel presses home the charge of perfidy as well as rebellion. Like Jeremiah, he looks on Nebuchadnezzar as reigning by a Divine right. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place <i>where</i> the king <i>dwelleth</i> that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, <i>even</i> with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Ezekiel repeats the prediction of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>. The prison in Babylon, under the eye of the king against whom he had  rebelled; this was to be the outcome-of the alliance with Egypt. The prophecy was probably written when the hopes of Zedekiah and his counsellors were at their highest point, when the Chaldeans had, in fact. raised the siege in anticipation of the arrival of the Egyptian army (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-11</a>). Ezekiel, like Jeremiah (<span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.), declared that the relief would be but temporary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shall Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By casting up mounts,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">when they cast up mounts</span>. The words describe the strategical operations, not of the Egyptians against the Chaldeans, but of the Chaldeans, when they recovered from their first alarm, against Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>). The Egyptians, Ezekiel predicts, would be powerless to prevent that second and decisive siege. In vers. 18, 19 the prophet emphasizes the fact that this would be the just punishment of Zedekiah's perfidy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these <i>things</i>, he shall not escape.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; <i>As</i> I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-20.htm">Ezekiel 17:20</a></div><div class="verse">And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The words receive a special significance as being identical with those which Ezekiel had uttered in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>, with the addition that the sin against Nebuchadnezzar as the vicegerent of Jehovah, was a sin against Jehovah himself as the God of faithfulness and truth. There, in Babylon, the real character of his sin should be brought home to the conscience of the blind and captive king. What follows in ver. 21, in like manner, reproduces <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14, 15</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a></div><div class="verse">And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set <i>it</i>; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant <i>it</i> upon an high mountain and eminent:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - From the message of deserved chastisement the prophet passes to the promise of restoration. The cedar of Israel is not dead. Jehovah would, in his own time, take the highest branch, tender and slender though it might be, the true heir of David's house, and deal with it far otherwise than the Chaldean conqueror had done. The latter had carried off the branch to the "land of traffick" - <span class="accented">sc</span>. had brought Jeconiah to Babylon. Jehovah would plant his branch upon the "mountain of the height of Israel" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>). It was not to be as a willow in a low place, but to flourish, true to its origin as a cedar, so that "all fowl of every wing" should dwell in the shadow of its branches (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>, where the same imagery is used of Assyria; and <a href="../../par/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>). As with like prophecies in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a> and Isaiah 53:2 (where the "tender one" finds a parallel), the words paint an ideal never historically realized, but finding a partia1 fulfilment in Zerubbabel and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple, merging in the still unfulfilled vision of the kingdom of the Messiah and the restoration of Israel. To Ezekiel, as to other prophets, it was not given to know the times and the seasons, or even the manner of the fulfilment of his hopes; and when he uttered the words, the vision may have seemed not tar off, but nigh at hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a></div><div class="verse">In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</div><div class="comm">

The thought, which reproduces that of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a>, finds an echo in <a href="../../par/luke/1-51.htm">Luke 1:51, 52</a>. Another echo of the words may, perhaps, be traced in the "green tree" and the "dry" of <a href="../../par/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>. Here then, also, as in ch. 16, the utterance which begins with judgment, ends in mercy. Behind the picture of the blind, discrowned king the prophet sees that of the Divine ideal King in the fulness of his majesty and power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
