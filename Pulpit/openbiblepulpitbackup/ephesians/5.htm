In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a> he had urged the example of God in one very momentous matter; he now urges it in a more general sense and on another ground. We ought to forgive men because God has forgiven us - all admit that; but moreover, we ought to imitate our Father in his forgiveness and in his loving spirit, be-because beloved children should always imitate, and will always strive to imitate, what is good in a beloved father. Forgiving love is one of the great glories of our Father; it has been made peculiarly attractive in our eyes, because it has been exercised by him towards us; every consideration, therefore, ought to induce us to show the same spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And walk in love.</span> Taking up anew the exhortation of <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>. Let your ordinary life be spent in an atmosphere of love. Drink it in from heaven, as plants drink in the sunshine; radiate it forth from eyes and face; let hands and feet be active in the service; let looks, words, and acts all be steeped in it. <span class="cmt_word">Even as Christ also loved us.</span> The passing from the Father to the Son as our Example is not a new departure; for the Son reveals the Father, the Son's love is the counterpart of the Father's, made visible to us in the way most fitted to impress us. Though Christ's love, like his Father's, is eternal, the aorist is used, to denote that specific act of love which is immediately in view. <span class="cmt_word">And gave himself for us.</span> The Pauline phrase (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>), simple, but very comprehensive: "himself"  - all that he was as God, all that he became as Man, a complete self-surrender, a whole burnt offering. "For us," not merely on our behalf, but in our room (after verbs of giving, dying, etc.); this, indeed, being implied in the idea immediately following of a <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, which, alike to the Jewish and pagan mind, conveyed the idea of a life given in room of another. <span class="cmt_word">An offering and a sacrifice to God.</span> Offering and sacrifice are nearly synonymous, but the first probably includes the whole earthly career of Christ incarnate - his holy life, blessed example, gracious teaching, loving companionship, as well as his atoning death, which last is more precisely the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, sacrifice. The offering and sacrifice were presented to God, to satisfy his justice, fulfill the demands of his law, and glorify his holy and righteous government. <span class="cmt_word">For a sweet-smelling savor.</span> Allusion to Noah's sacrifice of every clean beast and of every fowl - " the Lord smelled a sweet savor;" that is, the whole transaction, not the offering merely, but the spirit in which it was offered likewise, was grateful to God. The whole work of Christ, and the beautiful spirit in which he offered himself, were grateful to the Father, and procure saving blessings for all who by faith make the offering their own. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-21.</span> - THE WALK SUITABLE TO THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. Another of the remarkable contrasts of this Epistle; the fumes of lust are doubly odious in contact with the sweet savor of Christ's offering. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication and all impurity, or covetousness.</span> The combination of covetousness with sins of the flesh, occurring several times in the apostle's writings (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>), is rather unexpected. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, covetousness, means the desire of having more, which is peculiarly true of sensual sins; but it is not coupled with them by a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, but disjoined by an <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;</span>, indicating something of another class. In the mind of the apostle, sensuality was inseparable from greed, unnatural craving for more, dissatisfaction with what was enough; hence the neighborhood of the two vices. <span class="cmt_word">Let it not be even named among you, as becometh saints.</span> The practice of such sins was out of the question; but even speaking of them, as matters of ordinary conversation, was unsuitable for saints; the very conversation of Christians must be pure. The exhortation bears on Christians in their social relations; had the apostle been treating of the duty of the individual, he would have urged that such sins should never be admitted even to the thoughts or the imagination. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-4.htm">Ephesians 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And filthiness</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, implying that such things are disgraceful, ugly, revolting, the opposite of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, fair, comely, attractive. <span class="cmt_word">And foolish talking or jesting, which are not becoming.</span> This would be well understood in sensual, frivolous Ephesus; a light, bantering, jesting kind of talk, seasoned with <span class="accented">double entendres</span> and obscene allusions, very pernicious in its moral effect. There is no reason to suppose that the apostle meant to condemn all play of humor, which is a Divine gift, and which in moderation has its own useful place as a means of refreshing and invigorating the spirit; it was the jesting associated with ribaldry that drew his reproof. <span class="cmt_word">But rather giving of thanks.</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is somewhat similar in sound to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, jesting: the reason for putting the one in opposition to the other is not very apparent; the meaning seems to be that, in place of giving vent to lively feelings in frivolous talk and jesting, it is better for Christians to do so by pouring out their hearts in thanksgivings to God for all his goodness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this ye know well</span>; an appeal to their own consciences, made confidently, as beyond all doubt. <span class="cmt_word">That no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom.</span> Covetousness, the twin-brother sin of uncleanness, is denounced as idolatry. It is worshipping the creature more than the Creator, depending on vast stores of earthly substance in place of the favor and blessing of God. It must receive the doom of the idolater; instead of inheriting the kingdom, he must die the death. The doom in this verse is not future, but present - not <span class="accented">shall have</span>, but <span class="accented">hath</span>, inheritance, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11, 18</a>). The lust of greed overreaches itself; it loses all that is truly worth having; it may have this and that - lands, houses, and goods - but it has not one scrap in the kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Of Christ and God.</span> The two are united in the closest way, as equals, implying the divinity of Christ and his oneness with the Father in the administration of the kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no man deceive you with empty words.</span> No man, whether pagan or nominal Christian: the pagan defending a life of pleasure as the only thing to be had with even a smack of good in it; the Christian mitigating pleasant sins, saying that the young must have an outlet for their warm feelings, that men in business must put all their soul into it, and that life must be brightened by a little mirth and jollity. As opposed to what the apostle has laid down (ver. 5), such words are empty, destitute of all solidity or truth. <span class="cmt_word">For on account of these things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.</span> The sophistry is swept away by an awful fact - the wrath cometh, is coming, and will come too in the future life. It comes in the form of natural punishment, Nature avenging her broken laws by deadly diseases; in the form, too, of disappointment, remorse, desolation of soul; and in the form of judgments, like that which befell Sodom and Gomorrah, or the sword which never departed from David's house. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-7.htm">Ephesians 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</span> If you are partakers of their sins, you must be of their punishments too. Refuse all partnership, therefore. Your natural instincts recoil from partnership in punishment; let your spiritual instincts recoil from partnership in sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i>are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord.</span> Another expressive "but." To make the contrast more emphatic, it is not said, "ye were in darkness, but are now in light;" but, "ye were darkness itself, and are now light itself," and this last is explained by the usual formula, "in the Lord." There was a celebrated Ephesian philosopher, Alexander, who was called "The Light;" but not from that source had the light come. The idea of <span class="accented">light-giving</span> is also involved in their being light. "Arise, shine, for thy light is come." <span class="cmt_word">Walk as children of light.</span> Another expressive image, denoting close connection with light, as if they were actually born of it; hence their lives should be full of it. The figure connecting darkness with sin and light with purity, common to all languages, underlies the exhortation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">(For the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the fruit of light is [shown] in all goodness and righteousness and truth.</span> The exhortation is confirmed by this statement of what is the natural result of light - goodness, the disposition that leads to good works; righteousness, rectitude, or integrity, which is most careful against all disorder and injustice, and renders to all their due, and especially to God the things that are God's; and truth, meaning a regard for truth in every form and way - believing it, reverencing it, speaking it, acting according to it, hoping and rejoicing in it, being sincere and honest, not false or treacherous. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-10.htm">Ephesians 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</span> A general rule applicable to the whole walk. To prove is to ascertain by test and experiment. Our whole walk should be directed to finding out what things are pleasing to Christ, rejecting at once everything that is not so, and clinging to all that is. We are not to follow the tradition of our people, and not to take a vague view of duty; we are to prove the matter, to put it to the test. For the supreme practical rule of the Christian's life must be to please Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.</span> The point of this exhortation is in the adjective "unfruitful." The works of darkness are unfruitful; they produce no goodness, give rise to no satisfaction, to no moral results that are "a joy forever;" or, if fruit they have, it is shame, remorse, despair. Contrast this with the renovating, satisfying, joy-producing, fruits of righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">But rather even reprove them.</span> Do not be content with a passive attitude towards them, but take the aggressive and expose their wickedness, whether in public or in the domestic circle. A testimony has to be lifted up against ways that are so shameful and that bring down the wrath of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-12.htm">Ephesians 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the things that are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.</span> The groves of Ephesus were notorious for the shamefulness of lust. To speak of such deeds was not only wrong, but shameful; so extreme is the delicacy which Christianity fosters. Too much pains cannot be taken, by parents, masters of schools, and others, to foster this delicacy among the young - to exclude from conversation the faintest touch of what is unbecoming. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-13.htm">Ephesians 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light.</span> As, for instance, when our Lord reproved the hypocrisy of the Pharisees - their practices had not seemed to the disciples very evil before, but when Christ threw on them the pure light of truth, they were made manifest in their true character - they appeared and they still appear, odious. A just reproof places evil in a light that shows its true character. <span class="cmt_word">For everything which is made manifest is light.</span> Literally, this is a truism; anything shone on is no longer dark, but light. The nearest approach to <span class="accented">this</span>, morally, is that light has a transforming power; when the light of the gospel shines on anything dark or evil, it transforms it into what is light or good. This is not uniformly true; all the light of heaven turned on hell would not make it morally light; but it is the general property and tendency of moral light to transform. The exhortation would thus mean - Use your light to reprove what is evil or dark, for not only will the true character of the evil thereby be made apparent, but your light will have a transforming power. But if this were the meaning, we should expect in the end of the verse, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, to denote this transformation. The rendering of A.V., giving to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> an active meaning ("whatsoever doth make manifest is light"), is rejected by most grammarians, as not being consistent with the usage of the word. The meaning which that rendering gives is this: "Light is the element which makes all clear." We should thus have in the latter clause a proposition, affirming as universal what in the former clause is affirmed of one particular case; "things reproved are made manifest by the light, for it is only light that makes things clear." The exhortation to reprove would thus be confirmed by the consideration that the only way of making immoral things appear in their proper character is to let in on them the light of the gospel. The great practical point is that <span class="accented">Christians ought to let in and diffuse the light</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</span> This is evidently intended to give an additional impulse to the Ephesians to walk as children of the light; but a difficulty arises as to the source of the quotation. There is no difficulty with the formula, "he saith," which, like the same expression in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>, is clearly to be referred to God. But no such words occur in the Old Testament. The passage that comes nearest to them is <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>," Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord hath risen upon thee." The simplest and best explanation is, not that the apostle quoted from any lost book, but flint he did not mean to give the words, but only the spirit of the passage. This is evident from his introducing the word "Christ." It must be owned that the apostle makes a very free use of the prophet's words. But the fundamental idea in the prophecy is, that when the Church gets the light of heaven, she is not to lie still, as it' she were asleep or dead, but is to be active, is to make use of the light, is to use it for illuminating the world. The apostle maintains that the Ephesian Church had got the light of heaven; she, therefore, was not to sleep or loiter, but spring forth as if from the grave, and pour light on the world. The changes which the apostle makes on the form of the prophecy are remarkable, and show that it was to its spirit and substance rather than to its precise form and letter that he attached the authority of inspiration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15</a></div><div class="verse">See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take heed then how ye walk strictly.</span> The construction is somewhat peculiar, combining two ideas - see that you walk strictly, but consider well the kind of strictness. Do not walk loosely, without fixed principles of action; but make sure that your rules are of the true kind. Many are strict who are not wisely strict; they have rules, but not good rules. <span class="cmt_word">Not as unwise, but as wise.</span> This rendering brings out the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x1f76;</span>: "fools" (A.V.) is rather strong, for it is not utter folly that is reproved, but easy-mindedness, want of earnest consideration in a matter so infinitely vital, so as to know what is truly best. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a></div><div class="verse">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil</span>; or, <span class="accented">buying up for yourselves the opportunity</span>, the idea being that of a merchant who, knowing the value of an article and the good use to which he can put it, buys it up. The opportunity is the opportunity of spreading the light and acting according to it; and the reason assigned, "because the days are evil," indicates that, owing to the prevalence of evil, there is much need for the light over which the Christian has control. It may be hinted likewise that the prevalence of evil is apt to cool the love and diminish the zeal of the Christian; hence the need for special eagerness of spirit in the matter - he must greedily watch for his opportunity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-17.htm">Ephesians 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <i>is</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what is the will of the Lord.</span> The "wherefore" bears on all the preceding argument: because ye are children of light; because light is so valuable and so indispensable; because your whole circumstances demand so much care and earnestness. "Unwise" is equivalent to senseless; "understanding," to both knowing and laying to heart, as in parable of sower: "When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and <span class="accented">understandeth</span> it not," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does not consider or ponder it, "then cometh the wicked one," etc. The will of the Lord is the great rule of the Christian life; to know and in the deeper sense understand this, is to walk wisely and to walk surely. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be not intoxicated with wine, wherein is dissoluteness.</span> Drunkenness is suggested because it is a work of darkness; it is the foe to vigilance and earnestness, and it leads all who yield to it to act unwisely. It is the <span class="accented">social</span> aspect of drunkenness the apostle has in view - the exhilarating influence of wine in company, giving a rush of high spirits. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, the opposite of savingness, wastefulness, dissoluteness, or the process of being dissolved, involving perdition. Spoken of the prodigal son, "riotous living;" <span class="accented">the habit which sends everything to wreck and ruin</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But be filled with the Spirit.</span> Instead of resorting to wine to cheer and animate you, throw your hearts open the Holy Spirit, so that he may come and fill them; seek the joy that the Spirit inspires when he makes you to sit with Christ in heavenly places, so that, instead of pouring out your joyous feelings in bacchanalian songs, you may do so in Christian hymns. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-19.htm">Ephesians 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speaking to one another.</span> Literally, this would denote antiphonal singing, but this is rather an artificial idea for so simple times. It seems here to denote one person singing one hymn, then another another, and so on; and the meetings would seem to have been for social Christian enjoyment rather than for the public worship of God. In the Epistle to the Colossians it is, "Teaching and admonishing one another with psalms," and this has more of the idea of public worship; and if it be proper to express joyful feelings in the comparatively private social gatherings of Christians, it is proper to do the same in united public worship. <span class="cmt_word">In psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.</span> The precise meaning of these terms is not easily seen; "psalms" we should naturally apply to the Old Testament psalms, but the want of the article makes the meaning more general, equivalent to "songs with the character of the psalms;" hymns, songs celebrating the praises of the Divine Being, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; "spiritual songs" or odes of a more general cast, meditative, historical, hortatory, or didactic. But these must be "spiritual," such as the Holy Spirit would lead us to use and would use with us for our good. The two clauses correspond: "be filled with the Spirit;" "speaking in spiritual songs." Receive the Spirit - pour out the Spirit; let your songs be effusions sent forth from your hearts with the aroma of the Holy Spirit. Singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Lord Jesus. Some have argued that while <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> denotes singing, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> means striking the musical instrument. But <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> is so frequently used in a more general sense, that it can hardly be restricted to this meaning here. The great thought is that this musical service must not be musical only, but a service of the heart, in rendering which the heart must be in a state of worship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Giving thanks always for all things</span>; this being not only a most Christian duty, but an excellent way to keep the heart in good tone, to keep up happy feelings - the duty not being occasional, but "always," and not for things <span class="accented">prima facto</span> agreeable only, but "for all things" (see <a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father.</span> God the Father is the proper Object of thanksgiving, as of prayer generally; but the thanks are to be given in the Name of Christ. That is, through him who has brought in the economy of grace, whereby for wrath we get blessing, for suffering we get reward, for misery glory; whereby, in short, the whole aspect of life is brightened, and even the greatest trials and sorrows turned into real blessings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span> The last of the participial exhortations depending on the general exhortation of ver. 15 to walk strictly, Most commentators connect it with the three immediately preceding participles (speaking, singing, giving thanks), but are unable to find a link of connection. Better connect with ver. 15. Mutual subjection is part of a wise, circumspect <span class="accented">walk</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> mutual recognition of each other's rights and of our obligations to serve them. In some sense we are all servants, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> we are bound to serve others; the very father is, in this sense, servant of his child. So in the Christian Church we are all in a sense servants ("By love serve one another," <a href="../../par/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15, 16</a>). This view is in harmony with the <span class="accented">humble</span> spirit of the gospel. Pride leads us to demand rigorously from others what we fancy they owe to us; humility, to give to others what Christ teaches that we owe to them. The one feeling is to be discouraged, the other exercised and strengthened. In the verses following we have this precept split up into its constituent filaments. The reading of R.V., "in the fear of Christ," has more authority than A.V., "in the fear of God." It brings to our mind the wonderful example of Christ in this clement of character (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-51.htm">Luke 2:51</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>). Reverential regard for him should inspire us with the same spirit (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).

Parallel to this arrangement is the relation of Christ to the Church. In words, at least, all admit the headship of Christ, and the subordination of the Church to him. The Christian household, on a much lower level, should exemplify the same relation. <span class="cmt_word">Being himself savior of the body.</span> This is not said by way of contrast, but still by way of parallel. The very saviorship of Christ should find an analogy in the Christian husband. The husband should be the ever-vigilant and self-denying protector, guardian, deliverer, of his family, though his saving power can never come near the high level of Christ's A husband reckless of these obligations virtually ceases to have any claim on the subjection of the wife and the family. The very comparison of the husband to the Savior implies that, while there is a certain analogy, there is a still greater contrast. This is implied in the first word of the following verse. Between the lines we read this thought: "Not that the parallel between Christ's saving function and the husband's extends to the highest things." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives <i>be</i> to their own husbands in every thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span> [it exists so far as to enforce this exhortation] <span class="cmt_word">as the Church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their husbands in everything.</span> Let there be a subjection in the one case parallel to that in the other, for such is the Divine will and purpose. Any subjection due to the husband must be modified by what is due to God, for as the husband may not require for himself, so the wife may not give to him, what is God's: God's will is paramount over all. Of the three wills that may be in collision, viz. God's, the husband's, and the wife's - the duty of the wife is to take them in this order, having regard first to God's, next to her husband's, and last to her own. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a></div><div class="verse">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for her.</span> The husband's duty to the wife is enforced by another parallel - it ought to correspond to Christ's love for the Church. This parallel restores the balance; if it should seem hard for the wife to be in subjection, the spirit of love, Christ-like love, on the part of the husband makes the duty easy. Christ did not merely pity the Church, or merely desire her good, but loved her; her image was stamped on his heart and her name graven on his hands; he desired to have her for his companion, longing for a return of her affection, for the establishment of sympathy between her and him. And he gave himself for her (comp. ver. 2), showing that her happiness and welfare were dearer to him than his own - the true test of deep, real love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a></div><div class="verse">That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word.</span> The immediate object of Christ was to cleanse her, and for this end he used the Word as a purifying agent, washing her by means of it. The difference between selfish and unselfish love is seen here: a selfish lover cares for his wife in his own interest - like Samson, desires to have her simply because she pleases him, and, in his converse with her, thinks, not of her good, but of his own enjoyment; but the love of an unselfish lover constrains him to seek her good, to do nothing that will hurt her and damage her in any manner of way, but to do everything that he believes will advance her well-being, especially in the highest sense. He finds her polluted (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>.), and his great instrument of cleansing is "the Word" (comp. <a href="../../par/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>) - the Word in all its searching, humbling, rebuking, correcting, informing, stimulating, refreshing, consoling power.

Christ both gives and takes the bride; he presents her to himself - the day of his espousals being in the state of glory (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and all the training of this life being designed to fit her for that condition. She becomes glorious at last through assimilation to himself (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</span> The idea is that of a body perfectly free from blemish, typical of a soul perfectly delivered from sin - of a character perfected in all grace and goodness. <span class="cmt_word">But that it should be holy and without blemish.</span> The same truth expressed in positive form, which in the preceding clause is expressed in the negative. Nothing could more clearly denote perfection of character - the full development of the character with whatever of variety may arise from differences in natural gifts and constitution, or convey a more glorious idea of the destiny of redeemed humanity. To be, as it were, the bride of Christ is a high destiny in point of <span class="accented">condition</span>; but it would be miserable if character did not tally with condition; this agreement, however, is secured, for the Church is to be holy and without blemish. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28</a></div><div class="verse">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies.</span> A new illustration is introduced here to throw light on the bearing of the husband to his wife, and the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> seems to refer, not to what goes before, but to what follows (comp. in ver. 33). <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth his own wife loveth himself.</span> His wife is part of himself, so that not to love her as himself is not only a sin against law, but a sin against nature.

In this aspect of the case, too, the sharp eye of the apostle finds an analogy between the relation of the wife to the husband and that of the Church to Christ, expanded in the next verso.

The reference is to the original formation of woman as narrated in <a href="../../par/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>. Her very name indicated that she was "taken from man." She was taken from him and given to him. So the Church is taken from Christ and given to him. Taken from his body, sprung from his incarnation and his crucifixion and resurrection, the spiritual offspring of his humanity, and then given to him, to be his servant, nay, above a servant, his companion, friend, and confidant for evermore. If it had not been for the body of Christ (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5</a>) the Church could have had no existence. No bride fit for the King of heaven could have sprung from the earth. As Eve came from the opened side of Adam, so figuratively the Church springs from the pierced side of Jesus.

It seems to be introduced simply to show the closeness of the relation between man and wife; it is such as in a sense to supersede that between parent and child. The apostle (as appears from the next verse) has in view, at the same time, the parallel truth - the closeness of the relation between Christ and the Church; it too in a sense supersedes the relations of nature (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>).

It is called a mystery, and it is not said, as is said of another mystery, referred to before (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>), that it has been completely explained. Some light has been thrown upon it, but that is all. It is implied that there is something of mystery in many of the relations between things natural and things spiritual, but that in the depth and grandeur of the subject, the mystery connected with the marriage relation is pre-eminent - it is "a great mystery" The analogy of the wind to the Holy Spirit; the springing up of plants to the resurrection; the melancholy sounds of nature to the prevalence of sin; and many other analogies, present vague shadows of truth, the clear, full forms of which we cannot see. When the day breaks and "the shadows flee away," such things will appear in a clearer light.

The relation of Sarah to Abraham may again be referred to as indicating the true ideal of the relation of the wife to the husband. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ephesians/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ephesians 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ephesians 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ephesians/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ephesians 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ephesians 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
