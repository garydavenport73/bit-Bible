It is difficult to say with certainty which rendering is right, but on the whole the latter seems most probable. Although Gilead does lie north-east of Ephraim, it hardly seems a natural description of the Ephraimite movement to say they "went northwards;" whereas if they marched to Zaphon the phrase would be precise. The previous phrase, <span class="cmt_word">gathered themselves together</span>, means <span class="accented">mustered for battle</span>, as in <a href="../../par/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We will burn thine house</span>, etc. - the same savage threat as the Philistine youths made use of to induce Samson's wife to discover and reveal his riddle (<a href="../../par/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>), and as the Philistines actually put in practice upon her and her father in revenge for the destruction of their corn (<a href="../../par/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Passedst thou over</span>, as in <a href="../../par/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-2.htm">Judges 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I called you</span>. This incident is not mentioned in the previous narrative. Probably Jephthah asked the help of Ephraim when he was first made chief of the Gileadites, and they refused partly because they thought the attempt desperate, and partly because they were offended at Jephthah's leadership. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when I saw that ye delivered <i>me</i> not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?</div><div class="comm">

The obscurity arises partly from verses 5 and 6 being merely an amplification, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a narrative in detail of what is more briefly related in ver. 4; and from the insertion of the explanatory words, "Gilead lies in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh," in ver. 4. The literal translation of the two verses is as follows: - <span class="accented">And</span> <span class="accented">the men of Gilead smote Ephraim</span> (at the fords of Jordan), <span class="accented">for</span>, <span class="accented">said they</span>, <span class="accented">ye are fugitives of Ephraim.</span> (<span class="accented">Gilead lies in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between Manasseh and Ephraim, so that in coming from Manasseh, where they had taken refuge, to return to Ephraim they were obliged to pass through Gilead, <span class="accented">and the Gileadites had taken the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites</span>; <span class="accented">and it was so</span>, <span class="accented">that when the fugitives of Ephraim said</span>, <span class="accented">Let me pass over</span>, <span class="accented">that the men of Gilead said</span>, <span class="accented">Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said</span>, <span class="accented">Nay</span>, <span class="accented">then said they unto him</span>, <span class="accented">Say now Shibboleth</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they put him to the test of pronunciation; and if they found by his pronunciation of the word Shibboleth, viz., Sibboleth, that he was an Ephraimite, in spite of his denial, <span class="accented">then they took him and slew him</span> (killed him in cold blood) <span class="accented">at the passages of Jordan.</span> ) <span class="accented">And there fell at that time</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> The direct narrative goes on here from ver. 4. Omitting the long explanatory parenthesis from the latter part of ver. 4 to the latter part of ver. 6, the narrative runs (ver. 4), <span class="accented">And the men of Gilead smote Ephraim</span>, <span class="accented">for</span>, <span class="accented">said they</span>, <span class="accented">ye are fugitives of Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</span> The parenthesis explains why the Ephraimites had to pass through Gilead, and how the Gileadites ascertained in each case whether a man was an Ephraimite or not. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was <i>so</i>, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, <i>Art</i> thou an Ephraimite?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce <i>it</i> right.

A similar difference exists at the present day between the pronunciation of the inhabitants of different parts of Germany. What the Hanoverians call <span class="accented">stein</span>, a stone, the other Germans call <span class="accented">shtein. Shibboleth</span> means both <span class="accented">an ear of corn</span> and <span class="accented">a stream. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Forty and two thousand</span>. It is possible that the war between Jephthah and the Ephraimites may have lasted a considerable time, though only the single incident of the slaughter at the fords of Jordan is mentioned, so that the large number of 42,000 men may be less improbable than it seems at first sight. There is, however, always some doubt as to the correctness of numbers (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-7.htm">Judges 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in <i>one of</i> the cities of Gilead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Six years</span>. Perhaps his sorrow for his daughter shortened his life. <span class="cmt_word">Then died Jephthah the Gileadite</span>. Better, <span class="accented">And Jephthah the Gileadite died.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In one of the cities</span>. His exact burial-place was perhaps unknown, and therefore the general phrase <span class="accented">in the cities of Judah</span> was used, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12</a>. Lot is said to have dwelt <span class="accented">in the cities of the plain</span>, and in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-2.htm">Nehemiah 6:2</a> San-ballat asked Nehemiah to meet him <span class="accented">in the villages of the plain.</span> Still the phrase is not what you would expect here, and it seems unlikely that Jephthah's burial-place should be unknown. The Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions read, "in his city Gilead," as if Gilead had been the name of Jephthah's paternal city. Another conjecture is that there might have been an <span class="accented">Ar of Gilead</span> as well as the well-known Ar of Moab, or there might have been a collection of towns called Arey- Gilead (the towns of Gilead), after the analogy of Havoth-jair (<a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), but there is no evidence in support of these conjectures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 12:8-15 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-8.htm">Judges 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ibzan of Bethlehem</span>. It is uncertain whether Bethlehem of Judah is meant, or Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebu-lun, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>. Josephus says that Ibzan was of the tribe of Judah, and of the city of Bethlehem, and some have supposed a connection between the names of Boaz and Ibzan. ' But as Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah is generally called Bethlehem of Judah, or Bethlehem-Ephratah, and as Elon and Abdon were judges in North-East Israel, it is perhaps more probable that Bethlehem of Zebulun is meant. Dr. Robinson has identified it with a village - a "very miserable one" - called <span class="accented">Beit Lahm</span>, six miles west of Nazareth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-9.htm">Judges 12:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, <i>whom</i> he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He had thirty sons</span>, etc. From no record of Ibzan's judgeship being preserved, except this domestic incident, we may infer, as in the case of Jair, that no important events took place in his time. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-10.htm">Judges 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then died</span>, etc. Render, <span class="accented">And Ibzan died</span>.

Not Aijalon in the tribe of Dan, mentioned <a href="../../par/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>, but another city, only spoken of here, whose name is probably preserved in the ruins of <span class="accented">Jalun</span>, four hours east of Akka. It is remarkable that the two names <span class="accented">Elon</span> and <span class="accented">Aijalon</span> are identical in Hebrew as far as the consonants are concerned. It looks as if Aijalon, which is not mentioned among the Zebulonite cities in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10-16</a>, was named from Elon, its possessor.

The <span class="accented">Pharathon</span> which is mentioned in 1 Macc. 9:50, and by Josephus, following its authority, as fortified by Jonathan the brother of Judas may have been the same, though its collocation between Titans and Tekoah rather suggests a more southern position; and the <span class="accented">Ferata</span> found by Robinson between two and three hours from Samaria, south-south-west, on the way to Jerusalem, seems certainly to represent <span class="accented">Pirathon.</span>

This name points to some incident of which the memory is lost, though, with the usual tenacity of names, the name which once recorded it survives. It may have been some ancient settlement of the Amalekites, who were a very wandering, wide-spread race, which gave the name; or it may have been some great defeat and slaughter which they suffered from the Israelites, whose land they invaded (<a href="../../par/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3, 33</a>), just as the rock Oreb and the wine-press of Zeeb (<a href="../../par/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>) commemorated the victory over those princes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
