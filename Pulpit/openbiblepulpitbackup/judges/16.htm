It should be and. There is nothing to show when the incident occurred. It may have been many years after his victory at hal-Lechi, towards the latter part of his twenty years' judgeship. <span class="cmt_word">Gaza</span>, now <span class="accented">Ghuzzeh</span>, one of the five chief cities of the Philistines, once a strong place, but now a large open town. It was the last town in South-West Palestine on the road from Jerusalem to Egypt (<a href="../../par/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26, 27</a>). It played an important part in history in all ages - in the times, of the Pharaohs, the Seleucidae, the Maccabees, the Romans, the Khalifs, and the Crusaders. It was within the limits of the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>). It is first mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>, as the south-west border of the Canaanites. Its real transliteration from the Hebrew is Azzah, as it is actually expressed in the A.V. of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>. Gaza is the Greek form. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-2.htm">Judges 16:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And it was told</i> the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed <i>him</i> in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was told</span>. These words have no doubt accidentally fallen out of the Hebrew text, but they are necessary to the sense, and are expressed in all the ancient versions. We have no clue as to the motive of Samson's visit to Gaza, whether he was meditating its conquest, or an assault upon its inhabitants, or whether he came merely in the wild spirit of adventure, or upon civil business. We only know that he came there, that, with his usual weakness, he fell into the snare of female blandishments, that the Philistines thought to have caught him and killed him, but that he escaped by his supernatural strength. Gaza is about thirteen hours' march from Thimnathah. <span class="cmt_word">They compassed him in</span>. The Hebrew does not express this idea, nor is it what the Gazites did. It should be rendered, <span class="accented">They went about and lay in wait for him.</span> Instead of attacking him directly, they took a round-about course, and set an ambush for him in the city gates, probably in the guard-room by the side of the gate, intending when he came forth unsuspectingly in the morning, at the hour of opening the gates, to rush upon him and kill him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-3.htm">Judges 16:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put <i>them</i> upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that <i>is</i> before Hebron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Samson arose at midnight</span>. Possibly the woman had learnt the plot, and gave Samson warning, after the manner of Rahab; or she may have been his betrayer, and reckoned upon retaining him till the morning; anyhow he arose at midnight, when the liers in wait were sleeping securely, and tearing up the two gate-pests, with the gates and the cross-bar attached to them, walked off with them "as far as the top of the hill that is before Hebron." <span class="cmt_word">Took the doors</span>, etc. Rather, <span class="accented">laid hold of.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">went away with them</span>, translate <span class="accented">plucked them up.</span> It is the technical word for plucking up the tent pins. <span class="cmt_word">Bar and all</span>, or, <span class="accented">with the bar.</span> The bar was probably a strong iron or wooden crossbar, which was attached to the posts by a lock, and could only be removed by one that had the key. Samson tore up the posts with the barred gates attached to them, and, putting the whole mass upon his back walked off with it. <span class="cmt_word">The hill that is before Hebron</span>. Hebron "was about nine geographical, or between ten and eleven English, miles from Gaza, situated in a deep, narrow valley, with high hills on either side." It is approached from Gaza over a high ridge, from the top of which Hebron becomes visible, lying in the valley below at fifty minutes' distance. This spot would suit very well the description, "the hill that is before Hebron." Some, however, think that the hill called <span class="accented">el Montar</span>, about three-quarters of an hour from Gaza, on the road to Hebron, is here meant, and that the plain <span class="accented">before Hebron</span> merely means <span class="accented">towards</span>, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-4.htm">Judges 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name <i>was</i> Delilah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sorek</span>. See <a href="../../par/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>, note. The name has not yet been discovered as applied to any existing spot; but Eusebius in the 'Onomasticon' speaks of a village <span class="accented">Caphar-sorek</span> as still existing near Zorah. The term <span class="accented">valley</span> (<span class="accented">nachal</span>) describes a <span class="accented">wady</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a narrow valley with a stream.

The whole sum promised by the five lords would be no less than 5500 shekels, equal to about &pound;620 of our money. The curious notation, <span class="accented">eleven hundred pieces</span>, occurs again <a href="../../par/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a>. The reason of it is unknown. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength <i>lieth</i>, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.</div><div class="comm">

As regards the word rendered <span class="accented">withs</span>, it is not certain whether strings of cat-gut are not meant In <a href="../../par/psalms/11-2.htm">Psalm 11:2</a> the same word is used of a bow-string. The word rendered <span class="accented">green</span> means <span class="accented">fresh</span> or new, and might be equally applied to catgut strings or withs.

The word for <span class="accented">liers in wait</span> is in the singular number, but is to be taken collectively, as in <a href="../../par/judges/20-33.htm">Judges 20:33, 36-38</a>. In <a href="../../par/judges/20-37.htm">Judges 20:37</a> it is joined to a plural verb. It is to be presumed that through some concerted signal the liers in wait did not discover themselves. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-10.htm">Judges 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith</span>, or rather, as in ver. 8, <span class="accented">by what means.</span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-13.htm">Judges 16:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seven locks</span>, by which we learn that his mass of hair as a Nazarite was arranged in seven locks or plaits. His resistance was becoming weaker, and he now approached the dangerous ground of his unshorn hair. <span class="cmt_word">With the web</span>. This must mean the <span class="accented">warp</span>, which was already fastened in the loom, and across which Samson s locks were to be woven as the woof. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-14.htm">Judges 16:14</a></div><div class="verse">And she fastened <i>it</i> with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines <i>be</i> upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she fastened it with the pin</span>. The Septuagint and many commentators understand that she used the pin (it is the common word for a tent pin) to fasten the loom or frame to the ground, or to the wall. But a good sense comes out if we understand the phrase to mean, <span class="accented">So she struck with the shuttle</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she did what Samson told her to do, viz., wove his locks into the warp which was already prepared. This was done by successive strokes of the shuttle, to which the hair was fastened. <span class="accented">To strike with the peg or shuttle</span> may have been the technical phrase for throwing the shuttle with the woof into the warp; and it is a strong argument in favour of this interpretation that it makes her action the simple fulfilment of his directions. He said, "Weave my locks into the warp. So she struck with the shuttle." <span class="cmt_word">With the pin of the beam, and with the web</span>. The Hebrew word '<span class="accented">ereg</span> cannot mean <span class="accented">the beam</span>, as it is here translated; it is the substantive of the verb <span class="accented">to weave</span> in ver. 13. Its obvious meaning, therefore, is <span class="accented">the woof.</span> The pin of the woof, therefore, is the shuttle with the woof attached to it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Samson's hair, which was firmly woven into the <span class="accented">warp.</span> He went away with. This is the same word as was applied in ver. 3 to his <span class="accented">plucking up</span> the gateposts. Now, with the strength of his neck, he tore up the shuttle which fastened his hair to the warp, and so dragged the whole solid frame along with it. However, as we do not know the technical term of the art of the weaving among the Hebrews and Philistines, nor the precise construction of their looms, some obscurity necessarily attaches to this description.

Both the male and female divinities seem to have had the head and breast and hands human, and the rest of the body fish-shaped (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>). The fish was a natural emblem of fertility and productiveness, especially to a maritime people. The fish-shaped idol is found upon old Phoenician coins, and also on the monuments of Khorsabad, and on some Assyrian gems in the British Museum. One of the chief temples of Dagon was at Gaza. Several towns bore the name of Dagon, as <span class="accented">Beth-dagon</span> in Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>) and in Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), <span class="accented">Caphar-dagon</span> near Diospolis, etc., showing that the worship of Dagon was widespread.

Not on the occasion of his being brought into the temple as mentioned in ver. 25, but after his capture, and whenever they saw him grinding or elsewhere. It was this universal ascription of praise to Dagon that led to the celebration of this great feast. This praise of Dagon is also dwelt upon to show that God, in what happened, vindicated the glory of his own great name, which was blasphemed by the servants of Dagon when they thus made him superior to Jehovah. So Milton makes Samson say, "All the contest is now 'Twixt God and Dagon .... He, be sure, will not connive or linger, thus provoked, but will arise, and his great name assert." Generally, the 'Samson Agonistes' is an excellent commentary on the history of Samson.

It is not certain whether the idea conveyed is that of the A.V., that Samson was brought there to be as it were baited by the populace, jeered and jested at, reviled and reproached, perhaps struck or pelted; or whether the words do not simply mean to <span class="accented">dance with music</span>, which is certainly the meaning of the latter verb (he made sport before them, A.V. and margin) in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a> (<span class="accented">played</span>, A.V.; see ver. 6); <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They set him between the pillars</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he had done dancing; because he must have been dancing outside the house for the people on the roof to see him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-26.htm">Judges 16:26</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Suffer me</span>, or it may be rendered, <span class="accented">Let me rest.</span> He pretended to be tired, and asked to be allowed to rest a few minutes and lean against the pillars. <span class="cmt_word">That I may feel</span>, or, literally, <span class="accented">and make me feel.</span> He adds his motive for making the request -  <span class="cmt_word">that I may lean upon them</span> - to rest himself after the severe exercise of dancing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-27.htm">Judges 16:27</a></div><div class="verse">Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines <i>were</i> there; and <i>there were</i> upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the house was full</span>, etc. We do not know what was the construction of Philistine temples or houses of amusement; but from the description here given it seems that the interior was ranged like an amphi- theatre, with seats for the lords and principal people, and with an open front, so as to command a view of the stage just outside, and that front supported by pillars on which the beams of the roof, both the transverse beam and the longitudinal ones running into it, rested. The roof itself was fiat, and had the weight of 3000 people upon it, throwing a great strain upon the beams which rested upon the pillars. The sudden removal of the pillars would bring the roof down at that end, crowded as it was with the people, and would inevitably drag the whole mass in the same direction one over another, while the swaying of the people would bring the whole roof down upon the heads of those beneath, who would be crushed by the heavy timbers and stones and bodies of men falling upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-28.htm">Judges 16:28</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson called unto the Lord</span>. This is the first mention we have of Samson praying since the memorable occasion when he gave the fountain the name of <span class="accented">En-hakkoreh</span> (<a href="../../par/judges/15-19.htm">Judges 15:19</a>, note). Perhaps we may see in this an evidence that his affliction and shame had not been without their effect, in bringing him back to God humbled and penitent. The language is very earnest. "O Lord, Jehovah, remember me  strengthen me only this once, O God!" The threefold name by which he addresses the Almighty implies great tension of spirit. <span class="cmt_word">That I may be at once avenged</span>. Meaning <span class="accented">at one stroke</span>  - he would take one vengeance so terrible that it would be sufficient for his two eyes, which makes very good sense if the Hebrew will bear it. The literal translation would be, <span class="accented">that I may be avenged with a vengeance of one</span> stroke. Others take it, <span class="accented">that I may be avenged with a vengeance for one of my two eyes</span>, which it is not easy to understand the meaning of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-29.htm">Judges 16:29</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The two middle pillars</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-30.htm">Judges 16:30</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.

He knew it was certain death to himself, but he did not shrink from it. His last act should be to destroy the oppressors of his country. <span class="cmt_word">So the dead which he slew,</span> etc. The words sound like the snatch of some song or proverb in which Samson's death was described. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a></div><div class="verse">Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought <i>him</i> up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father.

But the Hebrew use of the word <span class="accented">brethren</span> is so wide, applied to cousins, or members of the same house of fathers, or of the same tribe, that it is by no means a certain inference. Here <span class="accented">his brethren</span> might mean the Danites generally, and <span class="accented">all the house of his father</span> those who were more nearly related, as belonging to the house of his father. His father was probably dead, and indeed the mention of his father's <span class="accented">burying-place</span>, or rather <span class="accented">sepulchre</span>, makes it certain that he was, so that Milton was in error in making him alive. <span class="cmt_word">Zorah and Eshtaol</span>. See above, <a href="../../par/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2, 25</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">And he judged Israel</span>. See <a href="../../par/judges/15-20.htm">Judges 15:20</a>. The parallel between Samson and Hercules is in many respects very remarkable, and has been drawn out by Serdrius and others. The supernatural strength of each, the slavery to women ("Quem non mille for, quem non Sthenellius hostis, Non potuit Mayors vincere, vicit amor." Ovid), the tearing asunder of the lion, the violent death of each, partly voluntary and partly forced, are all points of strong general resemblance. But one of the most remarkable is the connection of Hercules with two pillars. The "pillars of Hercules" on each side the straits of Gibraltar, Mount Abila and Mount Calpe, were said to have been rent asunder by the strength of Hercules' arms. And Herodotus relates that in the temple of Hercules at Tyre were two remarkable pillars, one of refined gold, the other of smaragdus, some green stone like an emerald (2:44). But the account given of a visit of Hercules to Egypt is still more remarkable, as compared with the history of the binding of Samson and the slaughter of the Philistines, as related in ch. 15. The following are the words of Herodotus: - "The Greeks say that when Hercules went down to Egypt, the Egyptians surrounded him, and led him in a procession to sacrifice him to Jupiter; that he kept quite still for a time, but that when they were commencing the sacrifice at the altar" (the first act of which was cutting off the hair) "he turned in self-defence, and by his prowess slew them all." On which Herodo. tus remarks, "How was it possible for him, being but one, and being only a man, to slay many myriads?" The prevalence of the worship of Hercules among the Phoenicians, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, at Tyre and Thasos, a Phoenician colony, and the close connection of Egypt with Gaza, where the prowess of Samson was so well known, are points not to be omitted in considering the probability of some of the legends of Hercules being drawn from the history of Samson. So also is the title of the Phoenician Hercules, the saviour or deliverer, as compared with <a href="../../par/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
