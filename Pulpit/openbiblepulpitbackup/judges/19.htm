It appears from <a href="../../par/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27, 28</a> that the events narrated in these three last chapters of the Book of Judges happened in the lifetime of Phinehas, and while the ark was at Shiloh (see <a href="../../par/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). Phinehas evidently outlived Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29, 33</a>), though there is no evidence to show how long. The events in these chapters must have occurred in the interval between the death of Joshua and the death of Phinehas. <span class="cmt_word">A certain Levite</span>, etc. It is a curious coincidence that both the Levite whose sad story is here told, and the Levite the son of Gershom of whom we read in the preceding chapters, were sojourners in the hill country of Ephraim, and also closely connected with Bethlehem-judah. Perhaps the legitimate inference (see ver. 18, and <a href="../../par/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26, 27</a>) is that in both cases the Levites were drawn to Ephraim by the ark being at Shiloh, and also that there was a colony of Levites at Bethlehem-judah. Whether there was any connection between the presence of Levites at Bethlehem and the annual sacrifice at Bethlehem which existed in David's time, and which argues the existence of a high place there, can only be a matter of conjecture (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>, and 1 Samuel 20:29). All we can say is that there was the universal prevalence of high-place worship during the time of the judges, and that the services of Levites were sought after in connection with it (<a href="../../par/judges/17-13.htm">Judges 17:13</a>). On the side. Hebrew, sides. In the masculine form the word means the hip and upper part of the thigh; in the feminine, as here, it is applied only to inanimate objects, as a house, the temple, a cave, the north, a pit, a country, etc., and is used in the dual number (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a>, etc.). It means the innermost, hindmost, furthermost parts. Its application here to the northern side of Ephraim seems to imply that the writer wrote in the south, probably in Judah. <span class="cmt_word">A concubine</span>. An inferior wife, who had not the same right for herself or for her children as the <span class="accented">wife</span> had (see <a href="../../par/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/19-2.htm">Judges 19:2</a></div><div class="verse">And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Played the whore</span>, etc. Perhaps the phrase only means that she revolted from him and left him. Her returning to her father's house, and his anxiety to make up the quarrel, both discourage taking the phrase in its worst sense. <span class="cmt_word">Four whole months</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">days</span>, <span class="accented">four months</span>; meaning either <span class="accented">a year</span> and <span class="accented">four months</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7</a>, where, however, the and is expressed; or <span class="accented">days</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> many days), viz., four <span class="accented">months.</span> For the use of <span class="accented">days</span> for a year see <a href="../../par/exodus/13-10.htm">Exodus 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/17-10.htm">Judges 17:10</a>, etc.

But the phrase to <span class="accented">speak to her heart</span> is such a common one for <span class="accented">to speak friendly</span> or <span class="accented">kindly</span> to any one that it is not likely that it should here be used otherwise, so that the pronoun should refer to <span class="accented">heart.</span> If the masculine is here the right reading, it may be an archaism making the suffix of the common gender like the plural suffix in ver. 24, which is masculine, though applied to women, and like the masculine pronoun itself, which is so used throughout the Pentateuch and elsewhere (see also <a href="../../par/judges/21-12.htm">Judges 21:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A couple of asses</span>. One for himself and one for her. <span class="cmt_word">He rejoiced</span>. No doubt, in part at least, because the expense of his daughter's maintenance would be transferred from himself to his daughter's husband. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/19-4.htm">Judges 19:4</a></div><div class="verse">And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Retained him</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/19-8.htm">Judges 19:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee.

It should rather be rendered in the imperative mood: <span class="accented">And tarry ye until the afternoon. <span class="cmt_word"></span>So they did eat both of them</span>. The imperative <span class="accented">comfort thine heart</span> is in the singular because only the man and the father-in-law are represented throughout as <span class="accented">eating and drinking both of them together.</span> The imperative <span class="accented">tarry ye is in</span> the plural because it applies to the wife as well as the man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/19-9.htm">Judges 19:9</a></div><div class="verse">And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Draweth toward evening</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which is uncommon, is, The <span class="accented">day is slackening to become evening</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heat and the light of the day are becoming slack and weak, and evening is coming on. <span class="cmt_word">The day groweth to an end</span>. Another unusual phrase; literally, <span class="accented">Behold the declining of the day</span>, or, as some render it, <span class="accented">the encamping of the day</span>, as if the sun after his day's journey was now pitching his tent for the night. Go home. Literally, <span class="accented">to thy tent</span>, as in <a href="../../par/judges/20-8.htm">Judges 20:8</a>. So the phrase, <span class="accented">To your tents</span>, <span class="accented">O Israel</span>, means, <span class="cmt_word">Go home</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10</a></div><div class="verse">But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which <i>is</i> Jerusalem; and <i>there were</i> with him two asses saddled, his concubine also <i>was</i> with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jebus</span>.

This absence of the common rites of hospitality toward strangers was a sign of the degraded character of the men of Gibeah (see <a href="../../par/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3-8</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>.

The abandoned character of the men appears in this, that not only did they offer no hospitality to the stranger themselves, but were ready to violate the sanctity of the hospitality of the old man's house by their brutal violence. There must have been a fearful absence of all law and order and government when such deeds could be done without any interference on the part of magistrate or elder or ruler of any kind. The singular resemblance of the whole narrative to that in <a href="../../par/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. suggests that the Israelites by their contact with the accursed Canaanites had reduced themselves to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah.

They understand the whole verse as what the Levite said when he sent the twelve pieces of the murdered woman to the twelve tribes, as thus: "<span class="accented">He sent her into all the coasts of Israel</span> (ver. 29), saying, <span class="accented">It shall come to pass that all who see it will say</span>, <span class="accented">There hath been nothing done and nothing seen like this from</span> the day, etc. But the A.V. makes very good sense, and the Hebrew will bear it. <span class="cmt_word">Consider of it</span>, etc. The general sense of the whole nation was to call a national council to decide what to do. The Levite had succeeded in arousing the indignation of the twelve tribes to avenge his terrible wrong. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/18.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 18"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 18" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/20.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 20"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 20" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
