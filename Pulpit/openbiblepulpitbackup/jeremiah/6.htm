The political rank of Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, makes it difficult to realize that Jerusalem was not locally a city of Judah at all. It belonged, strictly speaking, to the tribe of Benjamin, a tribe whose insignificance, in comparison with Judah, seems to have led to the adoption of a form of expression not literally accurate (see Psalm 128:68). The true state of the case is evident from an examination of the two parallel passages, <a href="../../par/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7, 8</a>, and Joshua 18:16, 17. As Mr. Fergusson points out, "The boundary between Judah and Benjamin... ran at the foot of the hill on which the city stands, so that the city itself was actually in Benjamin, while, by crossing the narrow ravine of Hinnom, you set foot on the territory of Judah" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:983). It is merely a specimen of the unnatural method of early harmonists when Jewish writers tell us that the altars and the sanctuary were in Benjamin, and the courts of the temple in Judah. The words of "<span class="accented">the</span> blessing of Moses" are clear (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-12.htm">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>): "The beloved of the Lord! he shall dwell in safety by him, sheltering him continually, and between his shoulders he dwelleth;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Benjamin is specially protected, the sanctuary being on Benjamite soil. And yet these highly favored "children of Benjamin" are divinely warned to flee from their sacred homes (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gather yourselves to flee</span>; more strictly, <span class="accented">save your goods by flight</span>. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a> the same advice was given to the inhabitants of the country districts. There, Jerusalem was represented as the only safe refuge; here, the capital being no longer tenable, the wild pasture-land to the south (the foe being expected from the north) becomes the goal of the fugitives of <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In Tokoa</span>. Tokoa was a town in the wild hill-county to the south of Judah, the birthplace of the prophet Amos. It is partly mentioned because its name seems to connect it with the verb rendered <span class="cmt_word">blow the trumpet</span>. Such paronomasiae are favorite oratorical instruments of the prophets, and especially in connections like the present (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A sign of fire in Beth-hakkerem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a signal on Beth-hakkerem</span>. The rendering of Authorized Version was suggested by <a href="../../par/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38, 40</a>; but there is nothing in the present context (as there is in that passage) to favor the view that a fiery beacon is intended. Beth-hakkerem lay, according to St. Jerome, on an eminence between Jerusalem and Tekoa; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably the hill known as the Frank Mountain, the Arabic name of which (<span class="accented">Djebel el-Furaidis</span>, Little Paradise Mountain) is a not unsuitable equivalent for the Hebrew (Vineyard-house). The "district of Beth-hakkerem" is mentioned in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. The choice of the locality for the signal was a perfect one. "There is no other tell," remarks Dr. Thomson, "of equal height and size in Palestine." <span class="cmt_word">Appeareth</span>; <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">bendeth forward</span>, as if it were ready to fall. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate <i>woman</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- I have likened... a comely and delicate woman</span>. This passage is one of the most difficult in the book, and if there is corruption of the text anywhere, it is here. The most generally adopted rendering is, "The comely and delicate one will I destroy, even the daughter of Zion," giving the verb the same sense as in <a href="../../par/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a> (literally it is, <span class="accented">I have brought to silence</span>, or perfect of prophetic certitude). The context, however, seems to favor the rendering "pasturage" (including the idea of a nomad settlement), instead of "comely;" but how to make this fit in with the remainder of the existing text is far from clear. The true and original reading probably only survives in fragments. Ver. 3 - <span class="cmt_word">The shepherds with their flocks</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">To her came shepherds with their flocks</span>; <span class="accented">they have pitched their tents round about her</span>; <span class="accented">they have pastured each at his side</span>. The best commentary on the last clause is furnished by <a href="../../par/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>, "Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch <i>their</i> tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</div><div class="comm">

Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare ye war</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sanctify</span> (or, <span class="accented">consecrate</span>) <span class="accented">war</span>. The foes are dramatically described as urging each other on at the different stages of the campaign. The war is to be opened with sacrifices (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a> with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>); next there is a forced march, so as to take the city by storm, when the vigilance of its defenders is relaxed in the fierce noontide heat (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>); evening surprises the foe still on the way, but they press steadily on, to do their work of destruction by night. The rapidity of the marches of the Chaldeans impressed another prophet of the reign of Josiah - Habakkuk (see <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto us! for the day goeth away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Alas for us! for the day hath turned</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-5.htm">Jeremiah 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Let us go; rather, <span class="accented">let us go up</span>. "To go up" is the technical term for the movements of armies, whether advancing (as here and <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>) or retreating (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5, 11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this <i>is</i> the city to be visited; she <i>is</i> wholly oppression in the midst of her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hew ye down trees</span>; rather, her <span class="accented">trees</span>. Hewing down trees was an ordinary feature of Assyrian and Babylonian expeditions. Thus, Assurnacirpal "caused the forests of all (his enemies) to fall" ('Records of the Past,' 3:40, 77), and Shalmaneser calls himself "the trampler on the heads of mountains and all forests "(Ibid. p. 83; comp. p. 90). The timber was partly required for their palaces and fleets, but also, as the context here suggests, for warlike operations. "Trees," as Professor Rawlinson remarks, "were sometimes cut down and built into the mound" (see next note); they would also be used for the "bulwarks" or siege instruments spoken of in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cast a mount</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pour a mount</span> (or "bank," as it is elsewhere rendered), with reference to the emptying of the baskets of earth required for building up the "mount" (mound). Habakkuk (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>) says of the Chaldeans, "He laugheth at every stronghold, and <span class="accented">heapeth up earth</span>, and taketh it" (comp, also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>). The intention of the mound was not so much to bring the besiegers on a level with the top of the walls as to enable them to work the battering-rams to better advantage (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:472). <span class="cmt_word">She is wholly oppression</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">she is the city that is punished</span>; <span class="accented">wholly oppression is in the midst of her</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually <i>is</i> grief and wounds.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As a fountain casteth out</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a cistern keepeth fresh</span> (literally, cool). The wickedness of Jerusalem is so thoroughly ingrained that it seems to pass into act by a law of nature, just as a cistern cannot help always yielding a supply of cool, fresh water. <span class="cmt_word">Violence and spoil</span>; rather, <span class="accented">injustice and violence</span> (so <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before me</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">before my face continually is sickness and wounding</span>. The ear is constantly dinned with the sounds of oppression, and the eye pained with the sight of the bodily sufferings of the victims. The word for" sickness" is applicable to any kind of infirmity (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3, 4</a>), but the context clearly limits it here to bodily trouble. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-8.htm">Jeremiah 6:8</a></div><div class="verse">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be thou instructed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Let thyself be corrected</span> (Authorized Version misses the sense, a very important one, of the conjugation, which is <span class="accented">Nifal tolerativum</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). The phrase equivalent to "receive correction" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>), and means to accept the warning conveyed in the Divine chastisement. Lest my soul, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">lest my soul be rent from</span> thee (Authorized Version renders the same verb in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-17.htm">Ezekiel 23:17</a>, "be alienated").

Unwilling as the people are to hear it, the disclosure must be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall thoroughly glean</span>, etc. "Israel" has already been reduced to a "remnant;" the ten tribes have lost their independence, and Judah alone remains (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>). Even Judah shall undergo a severe sifting process, which is likened to a gleaning (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>). The prospect is dark, but believers in God's promises would remember that a few grapes were always left after the gathering (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Turn back thine hand</span>. If the text is correct, the speaker here addresses the leader of the gleaners. Keil thinks this change of construction is to emphasize the certainty of the predicted destruction. But it is much more natural (and in perfect harmony with many other similar phenomena of the received text) to suppose, with Hitzig, that the letter represented in the Authorized Version By "thine" has arisen by a mistaken repetition of the first letter of the following word, and (the verbal form being the same for the infinitive and the imperative) to render <span class="accented">turning again the hand</span>. In this case the clause will be dependent on the preceding statement as to the "gleaning" of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">Into the baskets</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the shoots</span>. The gleaners will do their work with a stern thoroughness, laying the hand of destruction again and again upon the vine-shoots.

Elsewhere it is the heart (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-7.htm">Ezekiel 44:7</a>), or the lips (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a>) which are said to be "<span class="accented">circumcised</span>;" a passage in Stephen's speech applies the epithet both to the heart and to the ears (<a href="../../par/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).

The text has "pour it out." The sudden transition to the imperative is certainly harsh, and excuses the <span class="accented">conjectural emendation</span> which underlies the rendering of the Authorized Version. If we retain the imperative, we must explain it with reference to Jeremiah's inner experience. There are, we must remember, two selves in the prophet (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>), and the higher prophetic self here addresses the lower or human self, and calls upon it no longer to withhold the divinely communicated burden. All classes, as the sequel announces, are to share in the dread calamity. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the children abroad</span>; literally, <span class="accented">upon the child in the street</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-5.htm">Zechariah 8:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The assembly of young men</span>.

There is a special reason for the selection of "covetousness" here.

The passage is obscure. "Congregation" can only refer to the foreign nations mentioned in the first clause; for Israel could not be called upon to hear the judgment "upon this people" (ver. 19). There is, however, no other passage in which the word has this reference. The words rendered "what is among them," or "what (shall happen) in them," seem unnaturally laconic, and not as weighty as one would expect after the solemn introduction. If correct, they must of course refer to the Israelites. But Graf's conjecture that the text is corrupt lies near at hand. The least alteration which will remove the difficulties of the passage is that presupposed by the rendering of Aquila (not Symmachus, as St. Jerome says; see Field's 'Hexapla') and J. D. Michaelis, "the testimony which is against them."

The cruelty of the Assyrians and Babylonians seems to have spread general dismay.

The customs brought out into view m the monuments justify this most amply, though Professor Rawlinson thinks we cannot call the Assyrians (with whom the Babylonians may of course be coupled) naturally hard. hearted.

Naturally of a timid, retiring character, the prophet cannot help feeling the anxious and alarming situation into which at the Divine command he has ventured. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a></div><div class="verse">O daughter of my people, gird <i>thee</i> with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, <i>as for</i> an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wallow thyself in ashes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sprinkle thyself with ashes</span>, a sign of mourning (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>; so <a href="../../par/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mourning, as for an only son.</span> The Septuagint renders <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>, where in like manner the Septuagint renders, not "thine only son," but "thy beloved son"). Possibly this was to avoid a supposition which might have occurred to some readers (it has, in fact, occurred to several modern critics) that the "only son" was Adonis, who was certainly "mourned for" by some of the Israelites under the name of Thammuz (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), and whose Phoenician name is given by Philo of Byblus as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably <span class="accented">Yakhidh</span>, only begotten, the word used by Jeremiah; comp. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;</span>, equivalent to Berith). M. Renan found a vestige of the ancient festival of Adonis at Djebeil (the Phoenician Gebal) even at the present day. There would be nothing singular in the adoption of a common popular phrase by the prophet, in spite of its reference to a heathen custom (comp. <a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>), and the view in question gives additional force to the passage. But the ordinary explanation is perfectly tenable and more obvious. The phrase, "mourning [or, 'lamentation'] for an only begotten one," occurs again in <a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. In the last-mentioned passage it is parallel with "bitter weeping for a firstborn." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a></div><div class="verse">I have set thee <i>for</i> a tower <i>and</i> a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set thee</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">as an assayer have I set thee among my people</span>, <span class="accented">a fortress</span>. Various attempts have been made to avoid giving the last word its natural rendering, "a fortress." Ewald, for instance, would alter the points, and render "a separator [of metals]," thus making the word synonymous with that translated "an assayer;" but this is against Hebrew usage. Hitzig, assuming a doubtful interpretation of <a href="../../par/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>, renders "... among my people without gold," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "without there being any gold there for thee to essay" (a very awkward form of expression). These are the two most plausible views, and yet neither of them is satisfactory. Nothing remains but the very simple conjecture, supported by not a few similar phenomena, that <span class="accented">mibhcar</span>, a fortress, has been inserted by mistake from the margin, where an early glossator had written the word, to remind of the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, "I have made thee this day a fortress-city," '<span class="accented">it mibhcar</span>). In this and the following verses metallurgic phraseology is employed with a moral application (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 25</a>).

The objection to this rendering is that the burning of the bellows would involve the interruption of the process of assaying. We might, indeed, translate "are scorched" (on the authority of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>), and attach the word rendered "of the fire" to the first clause; the half-verse would then run: "The bellows are scorched through the fire; the lead is consumed," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the bellows are even scorched through the heat of the furnace, and the lead has become entirely oxydized. But this requires us to alter the verb from the masculine to the feminine form of third sing. perf. (reading <span class="accented">tammah</span>). It is better, therefore, to give the verb (which will be Kal, if the <span class="accented">nun</span> be radical) the sense of "snorting," which it has in Aramaic and in Arabic, and which the corresponding noun has in Hebrew (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>). The masculine form of the verb rendered "is consumed" is still a difficulty; but we have a better right to suppose that the first letter of <span class="accented">tittom</span> was dropped, owing to its identity with the second letter, than to append (as the first view would require us) an entirely different letter at the end. This being done, the whole passage becomes clear: "The bellows puff, (that) the lead may be consumed of the fire." In any case, the general meaning is obvious. The assayer has spared no trouble, all the rules of his art have been obeyed, but no silver appears as the result of the process. Lead is mentioned, because, before quicksilver was known, it was employed as a flux in the operation of smelting, <span class="cmt_word">Plucked away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">separated</span>, like the dross from the silver.
