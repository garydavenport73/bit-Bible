The withdrawal of the Chaldeans seemed to offer a gleam of hope. The Pharaoh referred to was the Hophra of the Jews, the Apries of Herodotus, the Uah-ab-ra of the monuments. His interference was useless; indeed, Hophra was one of the most unfortunate of the Egyptian kings (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>).

The Authorized Version says that his object was <span class="cmt_word">to separate himself thence.</span> But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the rendering is linguistically untenable; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the assumed object is incongruous with the circumstances and Character of Jeremiah, who was neither inclined to seek safety in isolation nor had any motive at present for doing so. The only safe rendering is, <span class="accented">to claim his share thence.</span> Whether there was just then a reallotment of communal lands must be left undecided; this would, however, be the most plausible hypothesis, if we could be sure that the present was a sabbatical year. The additional words, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the people,</span> would then acquire a special significance. The "people" would be the representatives of families who had an equal right to allotments with Jeremiah.

As Graf has pointed out, the princes, who had evinced their respect for Jeremiah on former occasions (ch. 26, 36.) had probably shared the captivity of Jehoiachin; Zedekiah's "princes" would be of a lower origin and type, and ready (like the judges in the French "terror") to accept any charge against an unpopular person without proper examination. <span class="cmt_word">The house of Jonathan the scribe</span>. "Scribe," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of the secretaries of state. The house of Jonathan seems to have been specially adapted for a prison, as the next verse shows. Chardin, the old traveller, remarks, "The Eastern prisons are not public buildings erected for that purpose, but a part of the house in which the criminal judges dwell. As the governor and provost of a town, or the captain of the watch, imprison such as are accused in their own houses, they set apart a canton of them for that purpose when they are put into these offices, and choose for the jailor the most proper person they can find of their domestics" (Chardin).

The latter is of more uncertain signification. It most probably means "vaults;" but it may mean "curved posts" - something analogous to stocks (see on Jeremiah 20:2).
