"The double city."

Graf thinks of Kir-heres (vers. 31, 36) or Kir-hareseth (another form of the same name; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-25.htm">2 Kings 3:25</a>), generally identified with Kir-Moab, the chief fortified town of the Moabites. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-2.htm">Jeremiah 48:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There shall be</i> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <i>being</i> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - There shall be <span class="cmt_word">no more praise of Moab;</span> rather, <span class="accented">Moab's glory</span> (or, <span class="accented">glorying</span>) <span class="accented">is no more</span> (comp. ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In Heshbon they have devised evil</span>, etc. There is a word play in the Hebrew, which may be reproduced thus: "In Plot-house they plot evil against it" (so J. F. Smith's Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">Against it</span> (literally, <span class="accented">her</span>) means "against Moab." Heshbon was at the time an Ammonitish town (it had in days gone by been Amoritish, <a href="../../par/numbers/21-26.htm">Numbers 21:26</a>); see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>; but was on the border of Moab. <span class="cmt_word">O Madmen.</span> There seems to be again a word play, which has been to some extent reproduced thus: "Thou shalt become still, O Still house." The name Madmen does not occur again, though an allusion to it has been fancied in <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-10.htm">Isaiah 25:10</a>, where the Hebrew for "dunghill" is <span class="accented">madmenah.</span>

This Moabite town was probably on the borders of Edom; hence, perhaps, "Sanballat the Horonite." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-4.htm">Jeremiah 48:4</a></div><div class="verse">Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab is destroyed.</span> The mention of Moab in the midst of towns is certainly surprising. We should expect Ar-Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Her little ones</span>. The received text, as it stands, is untranslatable, and our choice lies between the correction suggested by the vowel points, and the reading of the Septuagint and a few of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, "unto Zoar." In favour of the latter, which is adopted by Ewald and Graf, it may he urged that Zoar and Horenaim are mentioned together, not only in ver. 34, but also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, which has evidently been imitated in the following verse. It is not quite clear what "her little ones" in the first mentioned correction mean. Some think, the children; others, the poor; Hitzig prefers the small towns of Moab. On the site of "Zoar," see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' but compare Canon Tristram in 'The Land of Moab.' 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-5.htm">Jeremiah 48:5</a></div><div class="verse">For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in the going up of Luhith,</span> etc. The verse is substantially taken from Isaiah (Isaiah 15:5), but with variations peculiar to this chapter. The most peculiar of these is that in the first verse half, which is literally, <span class="accented">weeping goeth up</span> (not, <span class="accented">shall go up</span>)  <span class="accented">with weeping</span>, which is explained by Dr. Payne Smith to mean "one set of weeping fugitives pressing close upon another." To the present commentator (as also to Delitzsch - see his note on Isaiah 15:5) there seems no reasonable doubt that <span class="accented">b'ki</span>, the word rendered "weeping," should rather be <span class="accented">bo</span>, "upon it," so that the passage will run, as in Isaiah, "for the going up of Luhith with weeping doth one go up if," Hitzig (whom for once we find agreeing with Delitzsch) remarks that the miswriting <span class="accented">b'ki</span> for <span class="accented">bo</span> may be easily accounted for by the fact that <span class="accented">ki</span>, "for," is the word which follows next. We have no right to ascribe to Jeremiah such an artificial and un-Hebraic an expression as that of the received text. Small as the matter may be in itself, it is not unimportant as suggesting to the <span class="accented">Old</span> Testament student a caution against the too unreserved adoption of the canon <span class="accented">Lectioni faciliori praestat ardua</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In the going down of Horonaim.</span> An interesting variation from Isaiah. The older poet, less attentive to minutiae, had said vaguely, "in the road to Horonaim;" by a slight change of expression, the younger and more reflective writer produces a striking antithesis between the ascent to the hill-town, and the descent to the hollow in which Horonaim ("double cavern") appears to have been situated. It is possible, however, that Jeremiah has preserved the original reading, and that "the road" in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>, is due to the carelessness of a scribe. <span class="cmt_word">The enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span> But why this reference to the enemies? The rendering, however, is ungrammatical. The text is, literally, <span class="accented">the enemies of the cry of destruction have they heard.</span> The prophecy in Isaiah omits "the enemies of," and has a different verb for "have they heard." Can the inserted words be an intrusion from the margin? The later scribes were accustomed to insert glosses in the margin on occasions where we should have thought them entirely unnecessary for the purpose of explanation. But then why "the enemies of"? It is an insoluble enigma. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-6.htm">Jeremiah 48:6</a></div><div class="verse">Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Flee, save your lives;</span> literally, <span class="accented">your souls</span>. The prophet's human feeling prompts him to this counsel; but he knows full well that a life of abject misery is the utmost that can be hoped for. <span class="cmt_word">And be like the heath in the wilderness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">your souls</span>) <span class="accented">shall be like destitute ones in the wilderness</span>. Imagine the case of one who has been robbed of everything, and left alone in the desert; not less miserable is that of the Moabite fugitives. The word rendered "the heath" (<span class="accented">aro'er</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> either miswritten for <span class="accented">ar'ar</span>, which occurs in the sense of "destitute" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a> (see note), or also a rare plural form of the same word. The sense remains the same. It is tempting to see an allusion to one of the towns called Aroer (as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>). But the only Aroer the prophet could be thinking of is that on the Amen (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>), which could not be described as "in the wilderness."

In <a href="../../par/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> Moab is called "people of Chemosh," the patron-god being the king and lord of his people. In accordance with the strictly localizing theory of the nature of deity, current among primitive nations, Chemosh is said to go into captivity together with his worshippers (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>). This helps us to understand the idolatry into which the Jews fell during the Exile (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>); they imagined that Jehovah himself was "in captivity," and restrained from putting forth his power on behalf of his worshippers. The text reading is not Chemosh, but Chemish; the latter form does not occur elsewhere, but has been thought to illustrate the name of the Hittite city Carchemish (the Hittites or their predecessors may have been worshippers of this deity), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "castle of Chemosh."

Were the human instrument to delay, the curse meant for Moab would come upon himself. Is a reason demanded? It is that Moab has long been in a state of morally perilous security, and requires to be thoroughly shaken and aroused, in order that he may discover the inability of Chemosh to help his worshippers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give wings,</span> etc. Comp. ver. 28; also <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>, where the fugitive Moabites are likened to "wandering birds."

The "youth" of Moab dates from its subjugation of the aboriginal Emim (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>)' Since that event, though often at war, sometimes tributary and sometimes expelled from a part of the territory claimed by them (see the inscription on the Moabite Stone), yet they had  never been disturbed in their ancestral homes to the south of the river Amen. <span class="cmt_word">He hath settled on his less.</span> It was the custom to leave wine for a time on its lees or sediment, in order to heighten its strength and flavour (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Emptied from vessel to vessel.</span> Thevenot, an old traveller in Persia, remarks of the Shiraz wine that, after it is separated from the lees, it is apt to grow sour. "The wine is put into large earthen jars, each holding from ten or twelve to fourteen <span class="accented">carabas</span>; but when a jar has been opened, it must be emptied as soon as possible, and the wine put into bottles or <span class="accented">carabas</span>, otherwise it spoils and becomes sour" ('Voyages,' 2:245, quoted by Lowth on <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). In the application of the figure, the "taste" of Moab means obviously the national character.

The confusion of numbers and pronouns is remarkable. First, Moab collectively is spoken of as a wine jar; then the Moabites individually as Moab's jars; last of all, the Moabites are spoken of as possessing "jars" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the institutions, public and private, of the state and of society).

This idolatry was odious to the prophetic teachers of a nobler and more spiritual form of religion. They saw that the deity and the symbol were too much confounded, and that such a religion would not save its adherents from captivity and ruin (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5, 6</a>).

The Hebrew is <span class="accented">gibborim</span>, the name of David's select warriors (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>).

It is even doubtful whether it can be translated at all consistently with grammar, though Hitzig, a good grammarian, has adopted the suggestion of Grotius, rendering, "and her cities have gone up," <span class="accented">viz. in smoke, i.e.</span> they have been burnt; comp. <a href="../../par/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, the end of which verso ought to run thus: "The whole city went up to heaven." But even if the verb in third masc. sing. be allowable after the plural noun, it is very harsh to give it such an interpretation, when the context says nothing about fire or smoke. J.D. Michaelis and Ewald, therefore, propose to change the vowel points of the first word, rendering, "The spoiler of Moab and of her cities is gone up;" and Dr. Payne Smith inclines to follow them. We thus obtain a striking antithesis; the enemy has "gone up," and Moab's young men <span class="cmt_word">are gone down,</span> <span class="accented">i.e. are</span> felled by murderous hands (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>:71

The form of the first verse haft is modelled on <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>. Sit in thirst.

In <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 10</a> an allusion is made to this double meaning, and so, perhaps, it may be here ("There shall be shouting, but not that of the peaceful vintagers at their work").

The cry of one town echoes to another, and is taken up afresh by its terrified inhabitants. Heshbon and Elealeh lay on eminences but a short distance apart, so that the shrill cry of lamentation would be heard far away in the southeast at Jahaz. Zoar and Horonaim both lay in the southern half of Moah (see on vers. 3, 4). <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old.</span> If this is the right rendering, the phrase is descriptive of Horonaim, which may, in the time of Jeremiah, have been a "virgin fortress." But the phrase, thus understood, comes in very oddly, and in the parallel passage in Isaiah it stands, not after Horonaim, but after Zoar; it hardly seems likely that there were two Gibraltars in Moab. Another rendering (Ewald, Keil) is, "(to) the third Eglath." This involves an allusion to the fact that there were other places in Moab called Egiath or Eglah, which has been rendered highly probable by Gesenius. <span class="cmt_word">The waters also of Nimrhn.</span> Canon Tristram speaks of the "plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills into the Ghor-en-Numeira." Consul Wetzstein, however, says that nature appears there under so unspeakably gloomy an aspect, that the identification is impossible. He proposes a site in the Wady So'eb, about fourteen miles east of the Jordan, which with its luxuriant meadows, covered with the flocks of the Bedouin, is probably suitable to the passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah (Excursus it. in Delitzsch's 'Jesaja,' 4th edit., pp. 572, 573). So also Seetzen, who remarks that the lower part of this wady is still called Nahr Nimrin. In <a href="../../par/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> a place called Beth - nimrah is mentioned as situated in the valley (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jordan valley); no doubt this was in the wady referred to by the prophets. "The valley" seems to have been sometimes used in a wider signification, so as to include lateral valleys like that of Nimrim. The antiquity of the name is shown by its occurrence in the Annals of Thothmos III., who penetrated into the heart of Palestine, and, in the temple of Karnak, enumerates the cities which he conquered. From before  <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span> to nearly A.D.  this secluded valley has borne precisely the same name!

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-41.htm">Jeremiah 48:41</a></div><div class="verse">Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kerioth is taken.</span> Kerioth has been already mentioned in ver. 24 (see note). Another possible rendering is, <span class="accented">The cities are taken</span>, and this certainly agrees better with the parallel line. But a plural of <span class="accented">kiryah</span>, a city, does not occur elsewhere. If the identification of Kerioth with Ar-moab, the capital of Moab, be accepted (see on ver. 24), the equalization of Kerioth and "the strongholds" seems to be a stumbling block. <span class="cmt_word">Strongholds</span>; or, <span class="accented">mountain fastnesses</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-43.htm">Jeremiah 48:43</a></div><div class="verse">Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <i>shall be</i> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43-47.</span> - Hence, as the final result, escape is absolutely impossible, for one can get succeeds another in an endless series  The last and greatest danger besots those who seek refuge behind the strong fortifications of Heshbon, It is from this very city that the hottest fire of the enemy breaks forth. Chemosh has not saved his people; and yet there is hope for Moab in the future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear, and the pit, and the snare.</span> An alliteration in the Hebrew, which occurs again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17</a>. In German it can be represented better than in English - <span class="accented">e.g.</span> by Hitzig's "grauen, graben, garn." All primitive poetry delights in such alliterations.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a></div><div class="verse">They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - Apparently quoted from memory from <a href="../../par/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, except the first clause; the application, however, is peculiar to this passage. <span class="cmt_word">They that fled,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">The fugitives stand without strength in the shadow of Heshbon.</span> There is a difficulty here, for, according to ver. 2, the hostile raid into Moab started from Heshbon. Surely the fugitives would not think of escaping northwards, much less would they be able to elude the vigilance of the foe and reach Heshbon. But it is not surprising that the author of so long a poem should now and then make a slip; the author of the Book of Job is sometimes inconsistent with the Prologue, and ver. 2 is as far away from the passage before us as the Prologue of Job is from <a href="../../par/job/19-18.htm">Job 19:18</a>. Nor can we be absolutely certain that our prophecy is exactly as Jeremiah wrote it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall come forth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">hath come forth</span> (<span class="accented">or, cometh forth</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>From the midst of Sihon.</span> Sihon being, perhaps, regarded as the leader and representative of his warriors. <span class="cmt_word">The corner of Moab;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the sides</span> (literally, <span class="accented">side</span>, used collectively) <span class="accented">of Moab.<span class="cmt_word"></span> The tumultuous ones;</span> literally, sons of <span class="accented">tumult</span>, a poetical phrase for warriors. The prophet has substituted the more common word <span class="accented">shaon</span> for its synonym <span class="accented">sheth.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a></div><div class="verse">Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - Based on <a href="../../par/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a>. The chief difference is in the second half of the verse, in which the bold expression of Chemosh "giving his sons and his daughters into captivity" is changed for a mere ordinary and prosaic phrase.
