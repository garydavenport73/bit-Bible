<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a></div><div class="verse">Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house of the Rechabites</span> ("house" equivalent to "family"). From a notice in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> it appears that the Rechabites were a subdivision of the Kenites, the nomad tribe so closely connected with the Israelites (<a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-18.htm">Judges 4:18-22</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>), especially with the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). The names of Jonadab and of Jaazaniah and his progenitors (which include the sacred Name), together with the zeal of Jonadab for the worship of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15, 23</a>), seem to indicate that the religion of the Rechabites approximated closely to that of the Israelites. There seem, in fact, to have been two branches of the Kenites - one having Edomitish, the other Israelitish, affinities. Records of the former still exist in the Sinaitic inscriptions, and in the Arabian histories; indeed, there is still a tribe called Benu-l-Qain (often contracted into Belqein) in the Belqa (the ancient land of Ammon); and it would seem that there is an Arab tribe in Arabia Petraea, eastward of Kerak, which traces itself to Heber the Kenite. and goes by the name of Yehud Chebr, though it now denies any connection with Jews. There were also Jews of Khaibar, near Mecca, who played an important part in the early history of Islam (see further 'Zeitschr. der deutschen morgenland. Gesellschaft,' 8:706; 14:438; 28:568, 571). <span class="cmt_word">Into one of the chambers.</span> There were many "chambers" of different sizes attached to the temple, and employed partly for stores, partly for councils and assemblies, partly for guard chambers, and other official purposes (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>). In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a> we even find a private person occupying one of the "chambers." That into which Jeremiah conducted the Rechabites was, no doubt, one of the largest size; it was appropriated to the use of a single priestly family - the "sons of Hanan" (ver. 4).

There were three of these "keepers," corresponding to the number of the gates of the temple, and they ranked immediately after the high priest and his deputy (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>); comp." I had rather be  a doorkeeper," etc., in one of the Korahite psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-5.htm">Jeremiah 35:5</a></div><div class="verse">And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pots full of wine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">bowls</span>, large round vessels (<span class="accented">crateres</span>), out of which the drinking cups were filled.

This illustrates the uncompromising zeal of Jonadab in <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-23.htm">2 Kings 10:23</a>; the religion of Baal was probably at the opposite pole in the matter of luxury to that of Jehovah as practised by Jonadab. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Not for you the life<br />Of sloth and ease within the city's gates,<br />Where idol feasts are held, and incense smokes<br />To Baalim and Ashtaroth; where man<br />Loses his manhood, and the scoffers sit<br />Perverting judgment, selfish, soft, impure."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Plumptre.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall drink no wine,</span> etc. The Rechabites were, in fact, typical Arabs. The Wahhabee movement, in our own century, may be taken as partly parallel, though, of course, a settled life is not one of the abominations of the neo-orthodox Islam. A still more complete parallel is given by Diodorus Siculus (19:94), who states it to be the law of the Nabataeans, "neither to sow corn, nor to plant any fruit-bearing herb, nor to drink wine, nor to prepare houses," and gives as the motive of this the preservation of their independence.

Ver. 16 is rather an emphatic recapitulation of what has preceded. It runs literally, (<span class="accented">I say</span>) <span class="accented">that the sons of Jonadab have performed</span>, etc., <span class="accented">but</span> (<span class="accented">that</span>) <span class="accented">this people hath not hearkened unto me</span>; or, in more English phraseology, "Yea, the sons of Jonadab," etc.

The form of the promise is remarkable; it runs, <span class="cmt_word">Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.</span> The phrase is, as Dr. Plumptre remarks, "all but essentially liturgical. It is used of the Levites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5, 7</a>), of the worship of the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>), of the priests (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-11.htm">2 Chronicles 29:11</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-65.htm">Nehemiah 7:65</a>), of prophets (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-15.htm">1 Kings 18:15</a>), of priests and Levites together (<a href="../../par/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-2.htm">Psalm 135:2</a>)." It is, however, rash, perhaps, to maintain, with the same acute scholar, that the Rechabites were adopted into the tribe of Levi. The phrase may be simply chosen to indicate the singular favour with which Jehovah regarded the Rechabites - a favour only to be compared to that accorded to his most honoured servants among the Israelites - the patriarchs, the priests, and the prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
