The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in classical Greek is used as a term of reproach - abject, mean. The life of Christ ("I am meek and lowly in heart") and the teaching of Christ ("Blessed are the poor in spirit") have raised lowliness to a new position, as one of the chief features in the true Christian character. Here St. Paul bids us, as a discipline of humility, to look at our own faults and at the good points in the character of others (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others</span>. Translate, "looking," as R.V., not making one's own interest the one only object of life, but regarding also the interests, feelings, wishes, of others.

The words, "in Christ Jesus," show that the corresponding words, "in you," cannot mean "among you," but in yourselves, in your heart. The apostle refers us to the supreme example of unselfishness and humility, the Lord Jesus Christ. He bids us mind (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>) the things which the Lord Jesus minded, to love what he loved, to hate what he hated; the thoughts, desires, motives, of the Christian should be the thoughts, desires, motives, which filled the sacred heart of Jesus Christ our Lord. We must strive to imitate him, to reproduce his image, not only in the outward, but even in the inner life. Especially here we are biddcn to follow his unselfishness and humility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, being in the form of God</span>. The word rendered "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) means, as R.V. in margin, being originally. It looks back to the time before the Incarnation, when the Word, the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, was with God (comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 24</a>). What does the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> form, mean here? It occurs twice in this passage - Ver. 6, "form of God;" and Ver. 7, "form of a servant;" it is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> fashion, in Ver. 8. In the Aristotelian philosophy (<span class="accented">vide</span> ' De Anima,' 2:1, 2) <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>. is used almost in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as that which makes a thing to be what it is, the sum of its essential attributes: it is the form, as the expression of those essential attributes, the permanent, constant form; not the fleeting, outward <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, or fashion. St. Paul seems to make a somewhat similar distinction between the two words. Thus in <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> (or its derivatives) is used of the deep inner change of heart, the change which is described in Holy Scripture as a new creation; while <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used of the changeful fashion of the world and agreement with it (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Then, when St. Paul tells us that Christ Jesus, being first in the form of God, took the form of a servant, the meaning must be that he possessed originally the essential attributes of Deity, and assumed in addition the essential attributes of humanity. He was perfect God; he became perfect (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). For a fuller discussion of the meanings of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, see Bishop Lightfoot's detached note ('Philippians,' p. 127), and Archbishop Trench, 'Synonyms of the New Testament,' sect. 70. Thought it not robbery to be equal with God; R.V. "counted it not a prize [margin, 'a thing to be grasped'] to be on an equality with God." These two renderings represent two conflicting interpretations of this difficult passage. Do the words mean that Christ asserted his essential Godhead ("thought it not robbery to be equal with God," as A.V.), or that he did not cling to the glory of the Divine majesty ("counted it not a prize," as R.V.)? Both statements are true in fact. The grammatical form of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which properly implies  an action or process, favors the first view, which seems to be adopted by most of the ancient versions and by most of the Latin Fathers. On the other hand, the form of the word does not exclude the passive interpretation; many words of the same termination have a passive meaning, and <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> itself is used in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria, and a writer in the 'Catena Possini' on <a href="../../par/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42</a> (the three passages are quoted by Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loco</span>). The Greek Fathers (as Chrysostom <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.) generally adopt this interpretation. And the context seems to require it. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points to an act, the act of abnegation; not to a state, the continued assertion. The conjunction "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>) implies that the two sentences are opposed to one another. He did not grasp, but, on the contrary, he emptied himself. The first interpretation involves the tacit insertion of "nevertheless;" he asserted his equality, but nevertheless, etc. And the whole stress is laid on the Lord's humility and unselfishness. It is true that this second interpretation does not so distinctly assert the divinity of our Lord, already sufficiently asserted in the first clause, "being in the form of God." But it implies it. Not to grasp at equality with God would not be an instance of humility, but merely the absence of mad impiety, in one who was not himself Divine. On the whole, then, we prefer the second interpretation. Though he was born the beginning in the form of God, he did not regard equality with God as a thing to be grasped, a prize to be tenaciously retained. Not so good is the view of Meyer and others: "Jesus Christ, when he found himself in the heavenly mode of existence of Divine glory, did not permit himself the thought of using his equality with God for the purpose of seizing possessions and honor for himself on earth." The R.V. rendering of the last words of the clause," to be on an equality," is nearer to the Greek and better than the A.V., "to be equal with God." Christ was equal with God (<a href="../../par/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). He did not cling to the outward manifestation of that equality. The adverbial form <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> implies the state or mode of equality rather than the equality itself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But made himself of no reputation</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">but emptied himself</span>; not, he indeed, of the Godhead, which could not be, but of its manifestation, its glory. This he did once for all, as the aorist implies, at the Incarnation. The word "emptied' involves a previous fullness, "a precedent plenitude" (Pearson on the Creed, 2:25). The Divine majesty of which he emptied himself was his own, his own rightful prerogative; and his humiliation was his own voluntary <span class="accented">act - he</span> emptied <span class="accented">himself.</span> "He used his equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement" (Alford). "<span class="accented">Manebat plenus</span>, <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, et tureen perinde se gessit ac si esset" (Bengel). And took upon him the form of a servant; rather, as R.V., taking the form. The two clauses refer to the same act of self-humiliation regarded from its two sides. He emptied himself of his glory, taking at the same time the form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> as in Ver. 6, the essential attributes) of a servant, literally, of a slave. Observe, he was originally (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) in the form of God; he took (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) the form of a slave. The Godhead was his by right, the manhood by his own voluntary act: both are equally real; he is perfect God and perfect Man. Isaiah prophesied of Christ (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49</a> and Isaiah 52; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>, in the Greek or R.V.) as the Servant of Jehovah; he came to do the Father's will, submitting his own will in all things: "Not as I will, but as thou wilt" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-27.htm">Matthew 20:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-44.htm">Mark 10:44, 45</a><span class="cmt_word">). And was made in the likeness of men</span>; translate, <span class="accented">becoming</span>, or, as R.V., <span class="accented">being made</span> (aorist participle). This clause is another description of the one act of the Incarnation he <span class="accented">was</span> God, he <span class="accented">became</span> man. Form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>) asserts the reality of our Lord's human nature. Likeness (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) refers only to external appearance: this word, of course, does not imply that our Lord was not truly man, but, as Chrysostom says ('Hom.,' 8:247), he was more. than man; "We are soul and body, but he is God and soul and body." <span class="accented">The likeness of men</span>; because Christ is the Representative of humanity: he took upon him, not a human person, but human nature. He is one person in two natures. As Bishop Lightfoot says, "Christ, as the second Adam, represents, not the individual man, but the human race." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And being found in fashion as a man</span>. He humbled himself in the Incarnation; but this was not all. The apostle has hitherto spoken of our Lord's Godhead which he had from the beginning, and of his assumption of our human nature. He now speaks of him as he appeared in the sight of men. The aorist participle, "being found (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)," refers to the time of his earthly life when he appeared as a man among men. Fashion (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), as opposed to form (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), implies the outward and transitory. In outward appearance he was as a man; he was more, for he was God. He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death; translate, as R.V., <span class="accented">obedient.</span> The participle implies that the supreme act of self-humiliation consisted in the Lord's voluntary submission to death. the obedience of his perfect life extended even unto death. "He taketh away [literally,  'beareth,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] the sin of the world;" "The wages of sin is death;" therefore he suffered death for the sin which, himself sinless, he vouchsafed to bear. Here we may remark in passing that this connection of death with sin must have made death all the more awful to our sinless Lord. Even the death of the cross. No ordinary death, but of all forms of death the most torturing, the most full of shame - a death reserved by the Romans for slaves, a death accursed in the eyes of the Jews (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>).

He voluntarily assumed a subordinate position; God the Father exalted him. We must read, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">the</span> Name. This seems to mean, not the name Jesus, which was given him at his circumcision, in accordance with the angel's message; but the name Lord or Jehovah (comp. Ver. 11), which was indeed his before his incarnation, but was given (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth") to Jesus Christ, the incarnate Son, God and Man in one Person. Or more probably, perhaps, the word "Name" is used here, as so often in the Hebrew Scriptures, for the majesty, glory, dignity, of the Godhead. Compare the oft-repeated words of the psahnist, "Praise the <span class="accented">Name</span> of the Lord." So Gesenius, in his Hebrew lexicon on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> he explains the Name of the Lord as (b) Jehovah as being called on and praised by men; and (c) the Deity as being present with mortals (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a>).

The words may mean, either that all prayer must be offered to God in the name of Jesus, through his mediation; or that all creation must offer prayer to him. Both alternatives are true, and perhaps both are covered by the words; but the second seems to be principally intended (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a>, "I will lift up my hands in thy Name."

Observe, the words are, not "the name Jesus," but "the name of Jesus;" the name, that is, which God freely gave to him (Ver. 9), It is the name which is above every name, that is, the majesty, the glory of Jesus, which is to be the object of Christian worship. The end of the whole passage being the exaltation of Jesus, it seems more natural to understand this verse of worship paid to Jesus than of worship offered through him to God the Father. Observe also that the words (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>) on which this passage is formed are the words of Jehovah: "Unto <span class="accented">me</span> every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear."

The grace of God is alleged as a motive for earnest Christian work. The doctrines of grace and free-will are not contradictory: they may seem so to our limited understanding; but in truth they complete and snpplement one another. St. Paul does not attempt to solve the problem in theory; he bids us solve it in the life of faith (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. he "So run that ye may obtain;" and <a href="../../par/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>, "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy"). <span class="cmt_word">Of his good pleasure</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>).

He again compares the advantages of life and death, as in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20-25</a>. In the last verse he was speaking of the possibility of looking back from the day of Christ upon a life of prolonged labor. Here he supposes the other alternative. The form of the sentence, the particles used (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), and the indicative verb, all imply that the apostle looked forward to a martyr's death as the probable end of his life of warfare: Yea. he if I am even offered, as seems likely, and as I expect. <span class="accented">Offered</span>; the word means "poured out" as a libation or drink offering. St. Paul regards his blood shed in martyrdom as a libation poured forth in willing sacrifice. See <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am already being poured forth: the libation is commencing, the time of my departure is at hand." Compare also the similar words of Ignatius, 'Rom.' 2, and the words of the dying Seneca (Tacitus, 'Annals,' 15:64). Some think that the apostle, writing, as he does, to converted heathen, draws his metaphor from heathen sacrifices: in those sacrifices the libation was a much more important element than the drink offering in the Mosaic rites; and it was poured <span class="accented">upon</span> the sacrifice, whereas the drink offering seems to have been poured around the altar, not upon it. On the other hand, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is constantly used of the Jewish drink offering, and does not necessarily mean upon, but only "in addition to," or "at;" the drink offering being an accompaniment to the sacrifice. <span class="accented">Service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>).

In ecclesiastical Greek it stands for the order of the Holy Communion, the ancient liturgies; it is sometimes used loosely for any set form of public prayer. The analogy of <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, Where St. Paul exhorts Christians to present their bodies a living sacrifice, suggests that here the Philippians are regarded as priests (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>), offering the sacrifice of their faith, their hearts, themselves, in the ministrations of the spiritual priesthood; St. Paul's blood being represented as the accompanying drink offering. Others, comparing <a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>, where also sacrificial words are used, regard St. Paul himself as the ministering priest, and understand the metaphor of a priest slain at the altar, his blood being shed while he is offering the sacrifice of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">I joy, and rejoice with you all</span>. Meyer, Bengel, and others prefer "congratulate" as the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> "I rejoice with you."

"I know" (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>), "I hope" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>, in the Greek), "I trust" here. The apostle was subject, like all of us, to changing currents of thought, to the ebb and flow of spirits; but his trust was always in the Lord. "Behold," says Chrysostom, "how he makes all things depend upon God." His hope, in all probability, was fulfilled (see <a href="../../par/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a></div><div class="verse">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus</span>; translate, <span class="accented">but I count it necessary.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> here and in Ver. 28 are epistolary aorists; they point, that is, to the time of reading the letter, not to that of writing it; and are therefore to be rendered by the English present. Epaphroditus is mentioned only in this Epistle. Epaphras is the contracted form, but the name is a common one, and there is no evidence of his identity with the Epaphras of Colossians and Philemon. He seems to have been the bearer of this Epistle. St. Paul felt that to come himself, or even to  send Timothy, might possibly not be in his power; he thought it necessary, a matter of duty, to send Epaphroditus at once<span class="cmt_word">. My brother, and companion in labor, and fellow-soldier</span>. Mark how the epithets rise one above another; they imply fellowship in religion, in work, in endurance. <span class="cmt_word">But your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants</span>. "Your" refers to both clauses; "your messenger, and (your) minister to my need." Epaphroditus had brought to St. Paul the contributions of the Philippians (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). Some think that the word rendered "messenger" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, literally "apostle") means that Epaphroditus was the apostle, that is, the bishop of the Philippian Church. It may be so (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and note); but there is no proof of the establishment of any diocesan bishops, except St. James at Jerusalem, at so early a period. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. both here and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), is probably used in its first meaning in the sense of messenger, or delegate. The Greek word for minister, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, seems to imply, like <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in Ver. 30, that St. Paul regarded the alms of the Philippians as an offering to God, ministered by Epaphroditus. (But see <a href="../../par/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>, also <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-43.htm">2 Kings 4:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a>, etc. in the Greek.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-26.htm">Philippians 2:26</a></div><div class="verse">For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he longed after you all</span>. The verb is strengthened by the preposition: "was eagerly longing." Perhaps it should be rendered. he "is longing;" like "I count it necessary," in Ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">And was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</span> "Full of heaviness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is the word used of our blessed Lord in his agony (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a>). Some derive it from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, he away from home; others, more probably, from <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of loathing, weariness, satiety. The word implies heart-sickness, restless; unsatisfied weariness, produced by some overwhelming distress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-27.htm">Philippians 2:27</a></div><div class="verse">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow</span>. St. Paul recognizes the thankfulness of Epaphroditus for the recovery of his health: he shares that thankfulness himself. Mark his human sympathies; he had a "desire to depart," but he rejoices in the recovery of his friend. St. Paul does not seem to have healed Epaphroditus. The power of working miracles, like that of foreseeing the future (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>, and note), was not, it seems, continuous; both were exercised only in accordance with the revealed will of God and on occasions of especial moment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-28.htm">Philippians 2:28</a></div><div class="verse">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I send him</span> (epistolary aorist, as Ver. 25), <span class="accented">I send him with the letter.</span> Perhaps "again" is better taken with the following clause; "that when ye see him, ye may again rejoice." Note St. Paul's ready sympathy with the Philippians: their restored joy will involve a diminution of his sorrow. Mark also the implied admission that sorrows must still remain, though spiritual joy brightens and relieves them. "Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-29.htm">Philippians 2:29</a></div><div class="verse">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</span> <span class="accented">In the</span> <span class="accented">Lord</span> (see note on Ver. 19; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/16-2.htm">Romans 16:2</a>). With joy on every account. Notice the constant repetition of the word "joy," characteristic of this Epistle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a></div><div class="verse">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death</span>. The readings vary between "Christ" and "the Lord." One ancient manuscript reads simply, "for the work's sake." The work in this case consisted in ministering to the wants of St. Paul. Translate the following words, with R.V., <span class="accented">he came nigh unto death.</span> Not regarding his life; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">hazarding his life</span>, which translation represents the best-supported reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the verb literally means "to lay down a stake, to gamble." Hence the word <span class="accented">Parabolani</span>, the name given to certain brotherhoods in the ancient Church who undertook the hazardous work of tending the sick and burying the dead in times of pestilence. The A.V. represents the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> consulting amiss. <span class="cmt_word">To supply your lack of service toward me;</span> rather, as <span class="accented">R.V., that which was lacking in your service.</span> The Philippians are not blamed. Epaphroditus did that which their absence prevented them from doing. His illness was caused by over-exertion in attending to the apostle's wants, or, it may be, by the hardships of the journey. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> must be taken closely with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the lack of your presence. St. Paul, with exquisite delicacy, represents the absence of the Philippians as something lacking to his complete satisfaction, something which he missed, and which Epaphroditus supplied. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../philippians/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Philippians 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Philippians 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../philippians/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Philippians 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Philippians 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
