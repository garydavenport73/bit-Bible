But how awkward such a separation of the thing sworn by from the verb <span class="accented">is</span>, and how unnatural it is to couple with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> the two ideas, "before God" and "by Christ's epiphany," and how absolutely without example such a swearing by Christ's epiphany and kingdom is, nobody needs to be told. Others, as Huther, try to get over part at least of this awkwardness by taking the two <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>s as "both:" "by both his epiphany and his kingdom." Ellicott explains it by saying that as you could not put "the epiphany and the kingdom" in dependence upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as if they were persons like <span class="accented">God</span> and <span class="accented">Christ</span>), they "naturally pass into the accusative." But surely this is all thoroughly unsatisfactory. The T.R. is perfectly easy and simple. <span class="accented">Appear</span>ing (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); ver. 8; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. <span class="accented">His kingdom.</span> So in the Nicene Creed: "He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: whose kingdom shall have no end" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, followed by the judgment).

For "teaching" or "doctrine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>), St. Paul more frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the pastoral Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6, 13, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; ch. 3:10, 16, etc.); but there does not seem to be any great difference of meaning. Possibly <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> points more to the act of teaching. The use of it here, coupled with "long suffering," directs that the man of God, whether he preaches, reproves, rebukes, or exhorts, is always to be a patient teacher of God's Word and truth.

The verb occurs elsewhere in <a href="../../par/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5</a>, and ver. 17 of this chapter. The phrase is metaphorical, but it is uncertain whether the metaphor is that of a ship borne along by full sails, or of full measure given. If the former is the metaphor, then the derived meaning, when applied to persons, is that of full persuasion, entire and implicit faith, which carries men forward in a bold and unwavering course; or, when applied to things, that of being undoubtedly believed. But if the metaphor is taken from "bringing full measure;" then the sense in the passive voice when applied to persons will be "to be fully satisfied," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to have full assurance, and, when applied to things, "to be fully believed" (Liddell and Scott). Applying the last metaphor to the passage before us, the sense will be "discharge thy ministry to the fall." Let there be no stint of ministerial labour, but carry it out in its completeness, and to the end.

St. Paul uses the same figure in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, where he couples it with the sacrifice and service (or offering up) of the faith of the Philippians by himself as the priest, and looks upon the pouring out of his own life as the completion of that sacrifice (see Ellicott on Philippians). "The libation always formed the conclusion of the sacrifice, and so the apostle's martyrdom closed his apostolic service" (Huther), which had been a continual sacrifice, in which he had been the ministering priest (<a href="../../par/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). So that the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here exactly agrees with that in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>.

The word is found nowhere else in the New Testament, but St. Paul uses the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to depart," in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>, where, the verb being in the active voice, the metaphor clearly is from weighing anchor, as in  common use in classical Greek; hence simply "to depart." The classical use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> rather favours the sense, either of" release" or of " dissolution."

The word "fight" does not adequately express by agora, which embraces all kinds of contests - chariot race, foot race, wrestling, etc. "I have played out the honourable game" would give the sense, though inelegantly. <span class="cmt_word">The course</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="../../par/acts/13-25.htm">Acts 13:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>.

But nowhere else, either in the Old Testament or the New Testament, is this term applied directly either to God or to Christ.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Forsook</span> for <span class="accented">hath forsaken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">went</span> for <span class="accented">is departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. (twice). <span class="cmt_word">Demas</span>. Nothing more is known of Demas than what is gathered from the mention of him in <a href="../../par/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a> and <a href="../../par/philemon/1-1.htm">Philemon 1:1:24</a>. We learn from those passages that he was a fellow labourer of the apostle, and it is remarkable that in them both he is coupled, as here, with Luke and Mark (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>). (See Introduction.) <span class="cmt_word">Having loved this present world.</span> It would appear from this that Demas had not the faith or the courage to run the risk of sharing St. Paul's imminent martyrdom at Rome, but left him, while he was free to do so, under pretence of an urgent call to Thessaloniea; just as Mark left Paul and Barnabas (<a href="../../par/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>). But there is no ground to believe that he was an apostate from the faith. The coupling together of Demas and Aristarchus in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> suggests that Demas may have been a Thessalonian, as we know that Aristarchus was (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). <span class="accented">Demas</span> is thought to be a shortened form of <span class="accented">Demarchus.</span> If so, we have a slight additional indication of his being a Thessalonian, as compounds with <span class="accented">archos</span> or <span class="accented">arches</span> would seem to have been common in Thessalonica (compare <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Crescens</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); only mentioned here.

There was a cynic philosopher of this name in the second century, a great enemy of the Christians. The tradition ('Apost. Constit.,' 7:46) that he preached the gospel in Galatia is probably derived from this passage. Titus, etc. The last mention of Titus, not reckoning the Epistle to Titus, is that in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>, from which it appears that St. Paul had sent him to Corinth just before his own last visit to that city. How the interval was filled up, and where Titus passed the time, we know not. He is not once named in the Acts of the Apostles, nor in any of St. Paul's Epistles written during his first imprisonment. But we gather from <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> that he accompanied St. Paul to Crete, presumably after the apostle's return from Spain; that he was left there for a time to organize the Church; that later he joined the apostle at Nicopolis (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>),and, doubtless by St. Paul's desire, went to Dalmatia, as mentioned in this tenth verse. And here our knowledge of him ends. Tradition pretty consistently makes him Bishop of Gortyna, in Crete, where are the ruins of a very ancient church dedicated to St. Titus, in which service is occasionally performed by priests from the neighbourhood (Dean Howson, in 'Dict. of Bible:' art. "Titus").

How he spent his time between that date and the mention of him here as still with St. Paul, we have no knowledge. But it looks as if he may have been in close personal attendance upon him all the time. if he had been permitted to write a supplement to the Acts, perhaps the repeated "we" would have shown this. <span class="cmt_word">Take Mark.</span> Mark had apparently been recently reconciled to St. Paul when he wrote <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and was with him when he wrote <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>. We know nothing more of him till we learn from this passage that he was with or near to Timothy, and likely to accompany him to Rome in his last visit to St. Paul. He is mentioned again in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>, as being with St. Peter at Babylon. The expression, "take" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), seems to imply that Timothy was to pick him up on the way, as the word is used in <a href="../../par/acts/20-13.htm">Acts 20:13, 14</a>; and, though less certainly, in <a href="../../par/acts/23-31.htm">Acts 23:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He is useful to me,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as ch. 2:21 (where see note). This testimony to Mark's ministerial usefulness, at a time when his faithfulness and courage would be put to a severe test, is very satisfactory. <span class="cmt_word">For ministering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It may be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here means "the ministry," as in the A.V. and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, or, as in the R.V., more generally "for ministering," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for acting as an assistant to me in my apostolic labours. The words, "to me," favour the latter rendering. The sense would then be the same as that of the verb in <a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>, where we read that Timothy and Erastus "ministered unto him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to St. Paul, and that of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Mark in <a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>.

The presence of Luke, Timothy, Tychicus, Mark, with Paul now, as then, is remarkable (see ver. 10, note). <span class="cmt_word">I sent to Ephesus.</span> Theodoret (quoted by Alford, 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy,' ch. 9. sect. 1) says, "It is plain from this that St. Timothy was not at this time living at Ephesus, but somewhere else." And that certainly is the natural inference at first sight. But Bishop Ellicott suggests the possibility of Tychicus being the bearer of the First Epistle to Timothy, written not very long before, and this being merely an allusion to that well known fact. Another and more probable idea is that he was the bearer of this Epistle, that the object of his mission, like that of Artemas (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), was to take Timothy's place at Ephesus during Timothy's absence at Rome, and that he is thus mentioned in the Epistle in order to commend him to the reverent regard of the Ephesian Church (Wordsworth). It is argued against this that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> would have been the more natural expression after the analogy of <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>. But this objection would be removed if we suppose that the Epistle was sent by another hand, and that it was very possible that Timothy might have started for Rome before Tychicus could arrive at Ephesus. He might have orders to visit Corinth or Macedonia on his way. (For the arguments for and against Timothy being at Ephesus at this time, see Alford's 'Proleg.,' as above.)

This, again, is a Latin word. It occurs only here in the New Testament. They would probably be for the apostle to write his Epistles on. Or they may have been valuable manuscripts of some kind. In ver. 20 we learn that St. Paul had lately been at Miletus; and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a> that he was then going to Macedonia. Tress would be on his way to Macedonia, Greece, and Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8, 9, 11</a>), as it was on the return journey from Macedonia to Miletus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 15</a>). It should further be observed that the journey here indicated is the same as that referred to in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>, which confirms the inevitable inference from this chapter that St. Paul, on his way to Rome from Miletus, whither he had come from Crete (<a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>), passed through Tress, Macedonia, and Corinth (ver. 20), leaving Timothy at Ephesus. (See Introduction.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-14.htm">2 Timothy 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">Will render to him</span> for <span class="accented">reward him</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Alexander</span>; apparently an Ephesian, as appears by the words, "of whom be thou ware also." It seems probable, though it is necessarily uncertain, that this Alexander is the same person as that mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> as "a blasphemer," which agrees exactly with what is here said of him, "he greatly withstood our words" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>, "contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed"). He may or may not be the same as the Alexander named in <a href="../../par/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>. Supposing the Alexander of <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> and this place to be the same, the points of resemblance with the Alexander of <a href="../../par/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> are that both resided at Ephesus, that both seem to have been Christians (see note on 1 Timothy 1:20), and both probably Jews, inasmuch as <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1</a> relates entirely to Jewish heresies (vers. 4, 7, 8), and <a href="../../par/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> expressly states that he was a Jew. <span class="cmt_word">The coppersmith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>; only here in the New Testament); properly, <span class="accented">a coppersmith</span>, but used generally of any smith - silversmith, or goldsmith, or blacksmith. <span class="cmt_word">Did me much evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). This is a purely Hellenistic idiom, and is found in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/genesis/50-15.htm">Genesis 50:15, 17</a>; Song of the Three Children, 19; 2 Macc. 13:9.

And so it is used in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>. The question naturally arises - When and where did Alexander thus injure St. Paul? - at Ephesus or at Rome? Bengel suggests Rome, and with great probability. Perhaps he did him evil by stirring up the Jews at Rome against the apostle at the time of "his first defence;" or by giving adverse testimony before the Roman tribunal, possibly accusing him of being seditious, and bringing up the riot at Ephesus as a proof of it; or in some other way, of which the memory has perished. <span class="cmt_word">Will render.</span> The R.T. has the future, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> for the optative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "a late and incorrect form for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;</span> (Ellicott, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>).

In <a href="../../par/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a> the equally correct phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is used. The inference from this caution to Timothy is that Alexander had left Rome and returned to his native Ephesus. The Jews were always on the move. <span class="cmt_word">He greatly withstood our words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). For an exactly similar use, see <a href="../../par/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>, where Elymas "withstood" Paul and Barnabas; and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, where Jannes and Jambres "withstood" Moses. In this case we may be sure that Paul, in pleading for his life, did not omit to preach the gospel to his Gentile audience. Alexander tried to refute his words, not without effect. The apostle says "<span class="accented">our</span> words" (not "<span class="accented">my</span> words"), perhaps to associate with himself those other Christians who were with him. It certainly cannot mean "yours and mine," as Timothy was not with him when the "words" were spoken.

In classical Greek both forms are common in the sense of "coming to aid," "standing by any one," "assisting." Here it represents the Latin <span class="accented">assistere or adesse</span> in its technical sense of "standing by" an accused person as friend or assistant, to aid and abet them in their defence. Powerful men sometimes brought such a multitude of assistants as to overawe the magistrate, as Orgetorix the Helvetian, when summoned to trial, appeared  with ten thousand followers, and so there was no trial. Paul, like his Lord and Master, of whom it is written, "All his disciples forsook him and fled," had no one to stand with him in his hour of need.

The brave, unselfish spirit of the apostle thinking more of the proclamation of the gospel than of his own life, is truly admirable. <span class="cmt_word">I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> Surely there can be no doubt that, as Bengel says, this is a quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20, 21</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was delivered," comes from the twentieth verse, "Deliver my soul from the sword," and the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is found <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in ver. 21. The apostle means his deliverance from the executioner's sword. In the next verse we find both the words <span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the whole tone of the psalm breathes the same spirit as the saying, "The Lord stood by me." Dean Alford's suggestion that the lion here is Satan, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, and the danger which the apostle escaped was not death, which he did not fear, but betraying the gospel under the fear of death, is ingenious, but rather far fetched, though not impossible. It may possibly have been part of what was in St. Paul's mind.

Interpreted by the Lord's Prayer, and by its own internal evidence, the meaning clearly is, "The Lord, who stood by me at my trial, will continue to be my Saviour. He will deliver me from every evil design of mine enemies, and from all the wiles and assaults of the devil, in short, from the whole power of evil, and will bring me safe into his own kingdom of light and righteousness." There is a strong contrast, as Bengel pithily observes, between "the evil work" and "his heavenly kingdom." A triumphant martyrdom is as true a deliverance as escape from death. Compare our Lord's promise, "There shall not an hair of your head perish" (<a href="../../par/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a> compared with ver. 16). St. Paul's confidence simply is that the Lord would, in his own good time and way, transfer him from this present evil world, and from the powers of darkness, into his eternal kingdom of light and righteousness.

As regards <span class="accented">Pudens</span> and <span class="accented">Claudia</span>, nothing is known about them unless the very ingenious and interesting theory of Archdeacon Williams is true, which is necessarily very uncertain. According to this theory, Claudia is the <span class="accented">foreign</span> lady, a <span class="accented">Briton</span>, whose marriage with Pudens is spoken of by Martial in two epigrams, and who also bore the cognomen of <span class="accented">Rufina.</span> It is supposed that she was the daughter of the British king Cogidubnus, the ally of the Romans and of the Roman governor, Aulus Plautius, whose wife Pomponia is said by Tacitus to have been impeached of the crime of embracing a "foreign superstition," which was probably Christianity. Cogidubnus appears by an ancient inscription now at Goodwood to have taken the name of the Emperor Claudius, being called Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, which would naturally lead to his daughter being called Claudia. And if further she was adopted by the wife of her father's ally, the name Rufina would be accounted for, as a distinguished branch of the gens Pomponia bore the name of Rufus. And Martial's epigram is addressed to "Rufus," as one interested in the marriage. Claudia may either have learnt Christianity from Pomponia, or may have conveyed the knowledge of the gospel to her. On the other hand, the name of <span class="accented">Pudens</span> appears on the Goodwood inscription as having given, while still a heathen, a site for a temple of Neptune and Minerva, which was built "pro salute" of the imperial family under the authority of King Cogidubnus - curiously connecting him with the British king. It is probable that Pudens and Claudia were not yet married. Thus it will be seen that, while this theory is borne out by many coincidences, it cannot by any means be adopted as certain (see Dean Alford's <span class="accented">excussus</span> in the 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy;' and Conybeare and Howson's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. it. p. 501). Lewin ('Life and Epist. of St. Paul,' vol. 2, p. 392) warmly espouses the theory, but hesitates between Caractacus and Cogidubnus as the father of Claudia. Farrar rejects the whole theory "as an elaborate rope of sand" ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 2, p. 569). If Linus was the son, and Claudia the daughter, of Caractacus, they would be brother and sister.

Thus doses our last authentic account of this great apostle; these are, perhaps, the last words of him who wrought a greater change in the condition of mankind by his speech than any man that ever lived.
