And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - How long the paradisiacal state of innocence and felicity continued the historian does not declare, probably as not falling within the scope of his immediate design. <a href="../../par/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a> has been thought, though without sufficient reason, to hint that man's Eden life was of comparatively short duration. The present chapter relates the tragic incident which brought it to a termination. Into the question of the origin of moral evil in the universe it does not enter. The metaphysical problem of how the first thought of sin could arise in innocent beings it does not attempt to resolve. It seeks to explain the genesis of evil with reference to man. Nor even with regard to this does it aim at an exhaustive dissertation, but only at such a statement of its beginnings as shall demonstrate that God is not the author of sin, but that man, by his own free volition, brought his pristine state of purity and happiness to an end. A due regard to this, the specific object of the Mosaic narrative, will go far to answer not a few of the objections which have been taken to its historic credibility. Like the Mosaic record of creation, the Biblical story of the fall has been impugned on a variety of grounds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">doctrine</span> of a fall, which this chapter clearly teaches, has been assailed as inconsistent with the dictates of a speculative philosophy, if not also with the tenets of a Scriptural theology. While in the present narrative the origin of sin is distinctly traced back to the free volition of man acting without constraint, though not without temptation, in opposition to the Divine will, a more exact psychological analysis, it is alleged, declares it to have been from the first a necessity, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">metaphysically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being involved in the very conception of a finite will (Spinoza, Leibnitz, Baur); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">historically</span>, "<span class="accented">as</span> the expression of the necessary transition of the human race from the state of nature to that of culture" (Fichte, Kant, Schiller), or as developing itself in obedience to the law of antagonism and conflict (John Seotus Erigena, Hegel, Sehleiermacher, Schelling); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">theologically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> predetermined by a Divine decree (supralapsarianism). Without offering any separate refutation of these anti-Scriptural theories, it may suffice to say that in all questions affecting man's responsibility, the testimony of the individual consciousness, the ultimate ground of appeal, apart from revelation, affirms moral evil to be no all-controlling necessity, but the free product of the will of the creature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The <span class="accented">narrative</span> of the fall has been impugned - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> On the ground of its <span class="accented">miraculous character</span>. But unless we are prepared to equate the supernatural with the impossible and incredible, we must decline to admit the force of such objections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> On the ground of its <span class="accented">mythical form</span>, resembling as it does, in some slight degree, Oriental traditions, and in particular the Persian legend of Ormuzd and Ahriman (<span class="accented">vide</span> <span class="accented">infra</span>, 'Traditions of the Fall'). But here the same remark will apply as was made in connection with the similarity alleged to exist between the Mosaic and heathen cosmogonies: it is immeasurably easier and more natural to account for the resemblance of Oriental legend to Biblical history, by supposing the former to be a traditional reflection of the latter, than it is to explain the unchallengable superiority of the latter to the former, even in a literary point of view, not to mention ethical aspects at all, by tracing both to a common source - the philosophic or theologic consciousness of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There are also those who, while neither repudiating it on the ground of miracle, nor discrediting it as a heathen myth, yet decline to accept it as other than a <span class="accented">parabolic</span> or allegorical narration of what transpired in the spiritual experience of the first pair. History is often a parable of truth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">the serpent</span>. <span class="accented">Nachash</span>, from <span class="accented">nachash -</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in Kal, to hiss (unused), with allusion to the hissing sound emitted by the reptile (Gesenius, Furst), though it has been objected that prior to the fall the serpent could hardly have been called by a name derived from its present constitution (Delitzsch); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in Piel, to whisper, use sorcery, find out by divination (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>), suggestive of the creature's wisdom (Bush), Which, however, is regarded as doubtful (Furst); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> to shine (unused, though supplying the noun <span class="accented">nechsheth</span>, brass, <a href="../../par/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>), referring to its glossy shining appearance, and in par-titular its bright glistening eye: cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (T.

The presence of the article before nachash has been thought to mean <span class="accented">a certain serpent</span>, but "by eminent authorities this is pronounced to be unwarranted" (Macdonald). <span class="cmt_word">Was more subtle</span>. '<span class="accented">Arum</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Crafty (cf. <a href="../../par/job/5-12.htm">Job 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-5.htm">Job 15:5</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> prudent, in a good sense (cf. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>), from '<span class="accented">aram -</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> To make naked; whence atom, <span class="accented">plural arumim</span>, naked (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> To crafty (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>). If applied to the serpent in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Aquila, Keil, Lange, Macdonald), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>it can only be either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> metaphorically for the devil, whose instrument it was; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> proleptically, with reference to the results of the temptation; for in itself, as one of God's creatures, it must have been originally good. It seems more correct to regard the epithet as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), and to hold that Moses, in referring to the subtlety of this creature, "does not so much point out a fault as attribute praise to nature" (Calvin), and describes qualities which in themselves were good, such as quickness of sight, swiftness of motion, activity of the self-preserving instinct, seemingly intelligent adaptation -of means to end, with perhaps a glance, in the use of '<span class="accented">arum</span>, at the sleekness of its glossy skin; but which were capable of being perverted to an unnatural use by the power and craft of a superior intelligence (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c9;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Than any</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was subtil more than any</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>beast of the field which the Lord God had made</span>. The comparison here instituted is commonly regarded as a proof that the tempter was a literal serpent, though Macdonald finds in the contrast between it and all other creatures, as well as in the ascription to it of pre-eminent subtlety, which is not now a characteristic of serpents, an intimation that the reptile was no creature of earth, or one that received its form from God," an opinion scarcely different from that of Cyril (100. Julian., lib. 3), that it was only the <span class="accented">simulacrum</span> of a serpent. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the curse pronounced upon the serpent (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>) would seem to be deprived of all force if the subject of it had been only an apparition or an unreal creature; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the language of the New Testament in referring to man's temptation implies its literality (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). "We are perfectly justified in concluding, from this mention of the fall, that Paul spoke of it as an actual occurrence" (Olshausen). Adam Clarke contends with much enthusiasm that the tempter was not a serpent, but an ape or orangutan. <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>. Not as originally endowed with speech (Josephus, Clarke), or gifted at this particular time with the power of articulation ('Ephrem., lib. de paradiso,' c. 27, quoted by Willet), but simply as used by the devil (Augustine, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), who from this circumstance is commonly styled in Scripture '<span class="accented">The</span> serpent," "the old serpent," "that old serpent" (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>). Nor is it more difficult to understand the speaking of the serpent when possessed by Satan, than the talking of Balaam s ass when the Lord opened its mouth (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28-30</a>). Equally with the idea that the devil was the only agent in man s temptation, and that the serpent is purely the allegorical dress in which the historian clothes him (Eusebius, Cajetan, Quarry, Alford), must the notion be rejected that there was nothing but a serpent (Aben Ezra, Kalisch, Knobel). Why, if there was an evil spirit manipulating the reptile, the historian did not say so has been explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> on the ground that the belief in the devil was then foreign to the Hebrews (Knobel); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that up to this point in the narrative there is no mention of the devil (White of Dorchester); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that Moses simply wished to <span class="accented">be rei gestae scriptor non interpres</span> (Pererins); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was unnecessary, those for whom he wrote being sufficiently capable of discerning that the serpent was not the prime mover in the transaction (Candlish); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> that "by a homely and uncultivated style he accommodates what he delivers to the capacity of the people" (Calvin); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> that his object being merely to show that God had no hand in man's temptation, but that Adam sinned of himself, it was not needful to do more than recite the incident as it appeared to the senses (White); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> that he wished "<span class="accented">to</span> avoid encouraging the disposition to transfer the blame to the evil spirit which tempted man, and thus reduce sin to a mere act of weakness" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the woman</span>. As the weaker of the two, and more likely to be easily persuaded (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-14.htm">1 Timothy 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). Cf. Satan's assault on Job through his wife (<a href="../../par/job/2-9.htm">Job 2:9</a>). Milton's idea that Eve desired to be independent, and had withdrawn herself out of Adam's sight, it has been well remarked, "<span class="accented">sets</span> up a beginning of the fall before the fall itself" (Lunge). <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;</span>. Is it even so that? (Gesenius). Is it really so that! (Ewald, Furst, Keil). <span class="accented">Etiamne</span>, <span class="accented">vel Itane</span> (Calvin). A question either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> spoken in irony, as if the meaning were, "Very like it is that. God careth what you eat!" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> inquiring the reason of the prohibition (LXX., - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">cur praecepit vobis Deus</span>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> simply soliciting information (Chaldee Paraphrase); but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> most likely expressing surprise and astonishment, with the view of suggesting distrust of the Divine goodness and disbelief in the Divine veracity (Ewald, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Keil, Macdonald, Lunge). The conversation may have been commenced by the tempter, and the question "thrown out as a feeler for some weak point where the fidelity of the woman might be shaken" (Murphy); but it is more likely that the devil spoke in continuation of a colloquy which is not reported (Kalisch, Macdonald), which has led some, on the supposition that already many arguments had been adduced to substantiate the Divine severity, to render "yea" by "<span class="accented">quanto magis</span>," as if the meaning were, "How much more is this a proof of God's unkindness!" (Aben Ezra, Kimchi). <span class="cmt_word">Hath God said</span>. "The tempter felt it necessary to change the living personal God into a merely general <span class="accented">numen divinum"</span> (Keil); but the Elohim of <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. He was not a mere <span class="accented">numen divinum</span> As much astray is the observation that Satan wished to avoid profaning the name of Jehovah (Knobel). Better is the remark that the serpent could not utter the name Jehovah as his assault was directed against the paradisiacal covenant of God with man (Lange). By using the name Elohim instead of Jehovah the covenant relationship of God towards man was obscured, and man's position in the garden represented as that of a subject rather than a son. As it were, Eve was first placed at the furthest distance possible from the supreme, and then assailed. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden.</span> I.e. either accepting the present rendering as correct, which the Hebrew will bear, - "Are there any trees in the garden of which you may not eat?" "<span class="accented">Is</span> it really so that God hath prohibited you from some?" (Calvin), - or, translating <span class="accented">lo-kol</span> as <span class="accented">not</span> any - Latin, <span class="accented">nullus</span> (Gesenius, &sect; 152, 1) - "Hath God said ye shall not eat of any?" (Macdonald, Keil). According to the first the devil simply seeks to impeach the Divine goodness; according to the second he also aims at intensifying the Divine prohibition. The second rendering appears to be supported by the fitness of Eve's reply.

Neither afraid of the reptile, there being not yet any enmity among the creatures; nor astonished at his speaking, perhaps as being not yet fully acquainted with the capabilities of the lower animals; nor suspicions of his designs, her innocence and inexperience not predisposing her to apprehend danger. Yet the tenor of the reptile's interrogation was fitted to excite alarm; and if, as some conjecture, she understood that Satan was the speaker, she should at once have taken flight; while, if she knew nothing of him or his disposition, she should not have opened herself so freely to a person unknown. "The woman certainly discovers some uuadvisedness in entertaining conference with the serpent, in matters of so great importance, in so familiar a manner" (White). <span class="cmt_word">We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Omitting the Divine name when recording his liberality, though she remembers it when reciting his restraint; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> failing to do justice to the largeness and freeness of the Divine grant (cf. with <a href="../../par/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16</a>); - which, however, charity would do well not to press against the woman as symptoms of incipient rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it.</span> An addition to the prohibitory enactment, which may have been simply an inaccuracy in her understanding of Adam's report of its exact terms (Kalisch); or the result of a rising feeling of dissatisfaction with the too great strictness of the prohibition (Delitzsch), and so an indication "that her love and confidence towards God were already beginning to waver" (Keil); or a proof of her anxiety to observe the Divine precept (Calvin); or a statement of her understanding "that they were not to meddle with it as a forbidden thing" (Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Lest ye die</span>. Even Calvin here admits that Eve begins to give way, leading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;</span> as <span class="accented">forte</span>, with which Macdonald appears to agree, discovering "<span class="accented">doubt and hesitancy</span> in her language; but - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the conjunction may point to a consequence which is certain - indeed this is its usual meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/19-5.htm">Genesis 19:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Where there are so many <span class="accented">real</span> grounds for condemning Eve's conduct, it is our duty to be cautious in giving those which are problematical" (Bush); and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "she would have represented the penalty in a worse rather than a softened form had she begun to think it unjust" (Inglis).

"There is nothing in the Chaldean fragments indicating a belief in the garden of Eden or the tree of knowledge; there is only an obscure allusion to a thirst for knowledge having been a cause of man's fall"... The details of the temptation are lost in the cuneiform text, which "opens where the gods are cursing the dragon and the Adam or man for his transgression."... "The dragon, which, in the Chaldean account, leads man to sin, is the creature of Tiamat, the living principle of the sea and of chaos, and he is an embodiment of the spirit of chaos or disorder which was opposed to the deities at the creation of the world." The dragon is in-eluded in the curse for the fall; and the gods invoke on the human race all the evils which afflict humanity - family quarrels, tyranny, the anger of the gods, disappointment, famine, useless prayers, trouble of mind and body, a tendency to sin ('Chaldean Genesis,' pp. 87-91). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="accented">Persian</span>. For a time the first pair, Meschia and Mesehiane, were holy and happy, pure in word and deed, dwelling in a garden wherein was a tree whose fruit conferred life and immortality; but eventually Ahriman deceived them, and drew them away from Ormuzd. Emboldened by his success, the enemy again appeared, and gave them a fruit, of which they ate, with the result that, of the hundred blessings which they enjoyed, all disappeared save one. Falling beneath the power of the evil one, they practiced the mechanical arts, and subsequently built themselves houses and clothed themselves with skins. Another form of the legend represents Ahriman as a serpent. So close is the resemblance of this legend to the Scriptural account, that Rawlinson regards it not as a primitive tradition, but rather as "<span class="accented">an</span> infiltration into the Persian system of religious ideas belonging properly to the Hebrews" ('Hist.

In the Vishnu Purana the first beings created by Brama are represented as endowed with righteousness and perfect faith, as free from guilt and filled with perfect wisdom, wherewith they contemplated the glory of Visham, till after a time they are seduced.

Brought into his house, curiosity prevailed on her to lift the lid of a closed jar in which the elder brother had with prudent foresight shut up all kinds of ills and diseases.

And as the Creator has a perfect right to assign to his creature the specific place it shall occupy, and function it shall subserve, in creation, the remanding of the reptile to an inferior position could not justly be construed into a violation of the principles of right, while it might serve to God's intelligent creatures as a visible symbol of his displeasure against sin (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28-36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Above</span>.

"As the worm steals over the earth with its length of body," "as a mean and despised crawler in the dust," having previously gone erect (Luther), and been possessed of bone (Josephus), and capable of standing upright and twining itself round the trees (Lange), or at least having undergone some transformation as to external form (Delitzsch, Keil); though the language may import nothing more than that whereas the reptile had exalted itself against man, it was henceforth to be thrust back-into its proper rank," "recalled from its insolent motions to its accustomed mode of going," and "<span class="accented">at</span> the same time condemned to perpetual infamy" (Calvin). As applied to Satan this part of the curse proclaimed his further degradation in the scale of being in consequence of having tempted man. "Than the serpent trailing along the ground, no emblem can more aptly illustrate the character and condition of the apostate spirit who once occupied a place among the angels of God, but has been cast down to the earth, preparatory to his deeper plunge into the fiery lake (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; Macdonald). <span class="cmt_word">And dust shalt thou eat</span>, <span class="accented">I.e.</span> mingling dust with all it should eat.

More probably it originated in a too literal interpretation of the Mosaic narrative. Applied to the devil, this part of the curse was an additional intimation of his degradation. To "lick the dust" or "eat the dust" "<span class="accented">is</span> equivalent to being reduced to a condition of meanness, shame, and contempt" (Bush); "is indicative of disappointment in all the aims of being" (Murphy); "denotes the highest intensity of a moral condition, of which the feelings of the prodigal (<a href="../../par/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16</a>) may be considered a type' (Macdonald; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of thy life</span>.

The hostility commenced between the woman and her destroyer was to be continued by their descendants - the seed of the serpent being those of Eve's posterity who should imbibe the devil's spirit and obey the devil's rule (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>); and the seed of the woman signifying those whose character and life should be of an opposite description, and in particular the Lord Jesus Christ, who is styled by preeminence "the Seed" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16, 19</a>), and who came "to destroy the works of the devil" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).

A hendiadys for "the sorrow of thy conception" (Gesenius, Bush), though this is not necessary. The womanly and wifely sorrow of Eve was to be intensified, and in particular the pains of parturition were to be multiplied (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-8.htm">Jeremiah 31:8</a>). The second idea is more fully explained in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">sons</span>, daughters being included. The pains of childbirth are in Scripture emblematic of the severest anguish both of body and mind (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-2.htm">Revelation 12:2</a>).

Following the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>), Murphy explains it as meaning, "The determination of thy will shall be yielded to thy husband." According to the analogy of the two previous clauses, the precise import of this is expressed in the next, though by many it is regarded as a distinct item in the curse (Kalisch, Alford, Clarke, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall rule over thee</span>. Not merely a prophecy of woman's subjection, but an investiture of man with supremacy over the woman; or rather a confirmation and perpetuation of that authority which had been assigned to the man at the creation. Woman had been given him as an helpmeet (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>), and her relation to the man from the first was constituted one of dependence. It was the reversal of this Divinely-established order that had led to the fall (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>). Henceforth, therefore, woman was to be relegated to, and fixed in, her proper sphere of subordination. On account of her subjection to man's authority a wife is described as the possessed or subjected one of a lord (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>; Deuteronomy 20:22), and a husband as the lord of a woman (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-3.htm">Exodus 21:3</a>). Among the Hebrews the condition of the female sex was one of distinct subordination, though not of oppression, and certainly not of slavery, as it too often has been in heathen and Mohammedan countries. Christianity, while placing woman on the same platform with man as regards the blessings of the gospel (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), explicitly inculcates her subordination to the man in the relationship of marriage (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>)

Bush finds in the mention of Adam and his wife an intimation that they were furnished with different kinds of apparel, and suggests that on this fact is based the prohibition in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a> against the interchange of raiment between the sexes. <span class="cmt_word">And clothed them.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To show them how their mortal bodies might be defended from cold and other injuries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To cover their nakedness for comeliness' sake; <span class="accented">vestimenta honoris</span> (Chaldee Paraphrase). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To teach them the lawfulness of using the beasts of the field, as for food, so for clothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> To give a rule that modest and decent, not costly or sumptuous, apparel should be used. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> That they might know the difference between God's works and man's invention - between coats of leather and aprons of leaves; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> To put them in mind of their mortality by their raiment of dead beasts' skins - talibus indici oportebat peccatorem ut essent mortalitatis indi-cium: Origen" (Wilier). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> "That they might feel their degradation - quia vestes ex ca materia confectae, belluinum quiddam magis saperent, quam lineae vel laneae - and be reminded of their sin" (Calvin).

Combining with the intelligence of human nature the highest qualities of the animal world, as exhibited in the lion, the ox, and the eagle, they were emblematic of creature life in its most absolutely perfect form.
