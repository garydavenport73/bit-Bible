That Abraham did not stagger on receiving this astounding injunction may be accounted for by remembering that the practice of offering human sacrifices prevailed among the early Chaldaeans and Canaanites, and that as yet no formal prohibition, like that of the Mosaic code, had been issued against them - <span class="cmt_word">upon one of the mountains</span> - not Moreh in Sicbem (Tuch, Michaelis, Stanley, Grove, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), which was too distant, but Moriah at Jerusalem (Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Keil, Kalisch), where subsequently God appeared to David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>), and the temple of Solomon was built (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">which I will tell thee of</span> -  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> point out (probably by secret inspiration) as thou proceedest.

Amidst such a conflict of interpretations absolute certainty is perhaps unattainable; but the sense of the proverb will probably be expressed by understanding it to mean that on the mount of Abraham's sacrifice Jehovah would afterwards reveal himself for the salvation of his people, as he then interposed for the help of Abraham - a prophecy which was afterwards fulfilled in the manifestations of the Divine glory given in the Solomonic temple and in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.
