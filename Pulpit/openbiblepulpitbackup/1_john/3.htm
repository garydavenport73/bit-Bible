"And the goal of this love <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is that once for all (aorist) we have received the title 'children of God.'" And, whatever cavilers may say, the title is rightfully ours. (The words, "and (such) we are," are quite rightly inserted in the Revised Version after "children of God.") This is shown by the fact that the world does not recognize us as such, because from the first it did not recognize God. Had it known the Father, it would have known the children, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in St. John refers to what precedes (<a href="../../par/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18, 27, 39</a>); it does not merely anticipate the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> which follows it. In logical phraseology we have here first the major premise, then the conclusion introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, then (to clench the argument) the minor premise introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <TAB>We are children of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Therefore</span><TAB>the world knows us not; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">For</span><TAB>the world knows not God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But we must beware of supposing that every one who fails to recognize <span class="accented">our form</span> of Christianity is necessarily of the world. St. John invariably (but comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a>) speaks of "children of God" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, St. Paul generally of "sons of God", <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x2e;</span> The latter expression can apply to <span class="accented">adopted</span> sons; the former, strictly speaking, implies actual parentage.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest</span> (or, <span class="accented">it never yet was manifested</span>) <span class="cmt_word">what we shall be.</span> The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> is in opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span>: our present state is known; our future remains still unrevealed. Again (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27, 29</a>), we are in doubt about the construction. What is the nominative to "shall be manifested" <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>, "he" or "it"? The context is strongly in favour of "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "if it shall be manifested <span class="accented">what we shall be</span>;" <a href="../../par/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a> seems to favour "he," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "if <span class="accented">Christ</span> shall be manifested." The context must prevail. "Our future state is not yet made manifest. We know that on its manifestation we shall find ourselves like God." The two things will be contemporaneous. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes the following anecdote: "When some heathen converts to Christianity were translating a Catechism into their own language, they came upon <a href="../../par/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>. They stopped. 'No; it is too much,' they said; 'let us write that we shall be permitted to kiss his feet.'" Beware of inverting the meaning of the last clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>. It does not mean that the seeing God is a <span class="accented">proof</span> or <span class="accented">sign</span> of our being like him (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>), but the <span class="accented">cause</span> of our being like him: "We shall be like him, <span class="accented">because we</span> shall see him." God is light (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), and light is <span class="accented">seen.</span> In this life <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> we cannot see the light of the Divine nature "as it is," but only as it is reflected; and the reflected light cannot transmit to us the nature of the Divine original, though it prepares us to receive it. Hereafter the sight, "face to face" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>), of the Light itself will illuminate us through end through, and we shall become like it. Rothe takes "like him" to mean like Christ (<a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16, 17, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>); comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Such being our hope, based upon God's promises <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, of becoming like him, we must keep this prospect ever in view, and live up to it. Commentators differ as to whether <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> refers to the Father or Christ, and so also with regard to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The best way is to take <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> as God, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as Christ: this agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in verse 2, with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in verse 5, and with the common use of the two pronouns. It is doubtless possible, especially in St. John, to take <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as merely recalling the person already indicated by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or otherwise, and make both pronouns here refer to God. At first sight this seems to make a better sequence between verses 2 and 3: hereafter we shall be like God; therefore here we must strive to become pure as he is. Moreover, it is of the Father that it is written, "Be ye holy; for I am holy" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 16</a>); and again, "Ye shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>). But the other is simpler grammatically, and preserves the logical sequence equally well. Hereafter we shall be like God. Every one who has such a hope as this will aim at becoming like God here; <span class="accented">even as Jesus Christ has set us an example</span>, a perfect realization of human conformity to God.

Having shown what birth from God involves, he goes on to show what it excludes. "Every one that doeth sin" evidently balances "every one that hath this hope" (verse 3), and "to do sin" is the exact opposite of "to do righteousness" (chapter 2:29). Sin is lawlessness <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Both words having the article, the two terms are exactly equivalent - all sin is lawlessness, and all lawlessness is sin. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, like "lawlessness," expresses the <span class="accented">ignoring</span> of the law rather than the <span class="accented">absence</span> of it. "The law" means the law of God in the fullest sense, not the Mosaic Law. In short, sin is defined as the transgression of God's will.

Just in so far as he abides, he does not sin. Or it may mean that be who abides in Christ cannot deliberately and habitually sin. But then would not St. John have written, "He that abideth in Christ abideth not in sin"? But the main difficulty is in the second half. In what sense is it true that <span class="cmt_word">every one that sinneth hath not seen Christ?</span> In the main two explanations are given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Greek perfect expresses the present and permanent result of a past action, and is often equivalent to a present.

But does <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> ever mean "he seeth," as Alford suggests as the best rendering for a version? If St. John simply means that whoever sins thereby ceases to see and know Christ, he would hardly express himself thus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The fact of the man's sinning proves that his perception and knowledge have been imperfect, if not superficial, or even imaginary; just as the fact of Christians leaving the Church proves that they never were really members of it (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>). This explanation is preferable. In verse 2 we were told that seeing God will make us like God; and similarly, to see and know Christ make us like Christ. Whoever is unlike Christ, to that extent has not seen nor come to know him. The best of us, it may be, have seen but the hem of his garment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - St. John repeats his declaration with emphasis and fresh considerations; hence the repetition of the tender address (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>), "Little children, let no one ever seduce you into the belief that character and practice can be separated. He that <span class="accented">doeth</span> righteousness is righteous; for a righteous man inevitably practices righteousness." There are always persons who endeavour to reconcile religion with moral laxity, and in St. John's day some Gnostics definitely taught that conduct was immaterial to the spiritual man, for no external acts could defile such. "The external acts," says St. John, "prove the man's spiritual character and origin. He that doeth righteousness is righteous and is of God: he that doeth sin is of the devil." Note the difference between "even as" in verses 3 and 7. There <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> introduces a pattern as a fresh motive for self-purification; here it introduces a comparison. Christ is righteous, and his character produces nothing but righteousness; so also is it with the righteous Christian.

Other answers are: from the beginning <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the devil, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of the creation, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> of human history. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some of these are scarcely in harmony with Scripture; none, perhaps, fit the context so well as the explanation adopted. If the devil committed the first sin, and has sinned unceasingly ever since, then whoever sins is akin to him, is morally his offspring (<a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). There is the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the evil one, and man cannot find or make a third domain; if he is not in the one he is in the other. This verse, like <a href="../../par/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, seems to be conclusive as to the personal existence of the devil. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> balances <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: if the one is a mere personification of a tendency, why not the other? Both should be personal or neither. "It is not true that St. John speaks so confidently of a devil because he was a Jew and was filled with Hebrew opinions. For once that the devil is introduced in the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets, he is spoken of twenty times in any Gospel or Epistle" (Maurice), and not least in the Gentile Luke. With the latter half of verse 8. comp, verse 5. Christ's act in removing our sins from us destroys the devil's works; for by the manifestation of the Light (<a href="../../par/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>) the darkness is dispersed and destroyed. Our sins are the evil one's works: what is sin in us is his natural occupation. (For <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of unbinding or dissolving, and therefore destroying - a use specially frequent in St. John - comp. <a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-23.htm">John 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>.)

An act is different from a state of sin. This is an ideal to which every Christian is bound to aspire - inability to sin. But to some extent this ideal is a fact in the case of every true Christian. There are sins which to a good man are by God's grace quite impossible. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> is uncertain: either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "His seed abideth in Him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, those who are born of God abide in God; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "his seed abideth in him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the new principle which he has received continues to operate in the man; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "His seed abideth in him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, God's quickening Gift continues to operate in the man.

But this is the least probable of the three interpretations; in this sense St. John would probably have written <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Note the tense of the concluding verb, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>: his birth from God is a fact which <span class="accented">still continues</span>, not one that is past and gone.

"By their fruits ye shall know them." The children of God do righteousness, and not sin; the children of the devil do sin, and not righteousness. Of course, moral parentage is meant in both cases. Nothing here lends any countenance to the view that the writer is a dualist and inculcates two principles of existence - God and the devil. All, whether good or bad, are God's creatures (<a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>); but while all are his children by creation, some become his children spiritually also, while others become the children of Satan. St. John's "teaching about the devil is not at all agreeable to those who dwell exclusively on the sunny aspects of the world and of life, and would shut their eyes to what is dark and terrible. They like to hear of a Being who is all-gracious and loving; the vision of one who is the enemy of all that is gracious and loving shocks them - they wish to suppose that it belongs to the world's infancy, and that it disappears as we know more" (Maurice). The expression, "the children of the devil," must not be confounded with the Hebraistic expressions, "children of perdition, children of darkness," <span class="accented">"children</span> of light, son of death," "son of perdition," etc. As so often, St. John not only restates the case in a new form, but adds a new thought to it - he that loveth not his brother. This forms the link with the next section (verses 13-24), on brotherly love. Of all failures in doing righteousness this is the most conspicuous  - failing to love one's brother. And who is my brother? The answer is the same as to the question, "And who is my neighbour?" Mankind at large. The meaning cannot be limited to the children of God. Even <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (verses 14, 16) does not exclude unbelievers, still less does <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>.

Jerome, in his 'Commentary on Galatians' (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>), tells us that when St. John became too infirm to preach, he used often to say no more than this, "Little children, love one another."

In the LXX and the New Testament it seems to mean "slay" without necessarily implying the cutting the throat of a victim. That Cain's works were evil is not stated in Genesis, but is inferred from God's rejection of him. Compare carefully the remarkably parallel passage, <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a>. The wicked envy the good the blessedness of their goodness, and try to destroy what they cannot share. The war between good and evil is one of extermination; but the wicked would destroy the righteous, while the righteous would destroy wickedness by converting the wicked.

There is still a Cain, the world, hating its Abel, the Church. Therefore <span class="cmt_word">marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth</span>  <span class="cmt_word">you.</span> Here only does St. John use the address, "brethren," which is appropriate to the subject of brotherly love. Elsewhere his readers are "children" or "beloved." The "if" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span> with indicative) expresses no doubt as to the fact, but states it gently and conditionally.

The love of the brethren is the cause, not of the passing over, but of our knowing it. It proves that we have passed. And this test every one can apply to himself; "Do I, or do I not, find the love of the brethren within me?" A Christian can no more live without love than a plant can live without growth. He that loveth not abideth in death: he has not made the passage over. There is no accusative after "loveth," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being a gloss.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - As in <a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>, St. John passes at once from not loving to hating, treating the two as equivalent. He takes no account of the neutral ground of indifference. He that is not for his brother is against him. Indifference is hate quiescent, there being nothing to excite it. Love is the only security against hate. And as every one who does not love is potentially a hater, so every hater is potentially a murderer. A murderer is a hater who expresses his hatred in the most emphatic way. A hater who does not murder abstains for various reasons from this extreme way of expressing his hate. But the temper of the two men is the same; and it is obvious (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> "ye know what needs no evidence") that every murderer is incapable of possessing eternal life. It is the murderous temper, not the act of homicide, that excludes from eternal life. St. John, of course, does not mean that murder is an unpardonable sin; but he shows that hate and death go together, as love and life, and that the two pairs are mutually exclusive. How can life and the desire to extinguish life be compatible? It is very forced to interpret <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as either "destroyer of <span class="accented">his own</span> soul," or "destroyer of the hated man's <span class="accented">soul</span>," by provoking him to return hate for hate.

Love has been declared the criterion for distinguishing the children of God from the children of the devil. It remains to show what love is; and this is best seen in a concrete example. "The Eternal Word, incarnate and dying for the truth, inspires St. John to guard it with apostolic chivalry; but also this revelation of the heart of God melts him into tenderness towards the race which Jesus has loved so well. To St. John a lack of love for men seems sheer dishonour to the love of Christ" (Liddon). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - In this (verse 10; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>)we have come to know (have acquired and possess the knowledge of) love (what love is), in that he laid down his life for us.

Cain is the type of hate; Christ, of love. Cain took his brother's life to benefit himself; Christ laid down his own life to benefit his enemies (see on John 10:12). This realized ideal of love we must imitate; ready to sacrifice ourselves, and even our lives, for the good of others. The effacement of another's rights and perhaps existence for one's own sake is the essence of hatred; the effacement of one's self for another's sake is the essence of love. Christ died for those who hated him; and the Christian must confront the hatred of the world with a love that is ready even to die for the haters. This shows that the "brethren" here and in verse 14, though used primarily of Christians, does not exclude unbelievers; otherwise the parallel with Christ would be spoiled (see on verse 10).

Whatever the child of God asks as such, he <span class="accented">ipso facto</span> obtains (<a href="../../par/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>). This is the ideal condition of things; for the child of God cannot ask what displeases his Father. And we are his children "because we keep his commandments." The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> must not be connected too closely with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, as if our obedience were the <span class="accented">cause</span> of God's hearing our prayers. Our obedience shows that we are such as can pray efficaciously. (For the parallelism, comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-3.htm">Isaiah 38:3</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-23.htm">1 John 3:23</a></div><div class="verse">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his commandment is this</span> (comp. verse 11), <span class="cmt_word">that we should believe the Name, etc.</span> "Do not forget," St. John would say, "what the full scope of his commandment is. It is not exhausted by loving the brethren; we must also believe in his Son: and the one implies the other." What is the meaning of <span class="accented">"believing the Name</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>? We can believe a document (<a href="../../par/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>), or a statement (<a href="../../par/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-38.htm">John 12:38</a>), or a person (<a href="../../par/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37, 38</a>); but how can we believe a name? By believing those truths which the name implies: in the present case by believing that Jesus is the Saviour, is the Messiah, is the Son of God. To produce this belief and its consequence, eternal life, is the purpose of St. John's Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>); it is also the will of God (<a href="../../par/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>), and the command of his Son (<a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>). This belief will inevitably produce as its fruit that we "love one another [present tense of what is habitual], even as Christ gave us commandment" (<a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-12.htm">John 15:12, 17</a>). Throughout the Epistle, and especially in this passage (verses 22-24), the references to Christ's farewell discourses in the Gospel are frequent. Here the main ideas of those discourses are represented - obedience to the Divine commands, particularly as to faith and love; promised answer to prayer, abiding in God; the gift of the Spirit (see on 1 John 4:5). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a></div><div class="verse">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.

The former seems better on account of verse 22; but the latter may be right (<a href="../../par/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>). Compare  the conclusion of the first main division (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In this</span> (or, <span class="accented">hereby</span>) probably refers to what follows; the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> does not disprove this, in spite of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> which follows. St. John has combined two constructions: "In this we know...  <span class="accented">in that"</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, as in verse 16; and "From this we know...  <span class="accented">from"</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-6.htm">1 John 4:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">From the Spirit which he gave us.</span> "He" is probably the Father (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17</a>), and the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> refers to the special occasion of Pentecost. Hitherto St. John has mentioned only the Father and the Son; now the Spirit also (alluded to in <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20, 27</a>) is introduced by name as a witness and test of the truth. The sentence forms the transition to the subject of the next section (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-6</a>), which is a sort of digression, the subject of love being mentioned in verse 7. This verse is said to have been a favourite with Spinoza. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_john/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 John 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 John 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_john/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 John 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 John 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
