The reference is to what is said in the last verse of the preceding chapter, viz. that the predicted destruction was not inflicted. How the knowledge of this reprieve was conveyed to the prophet we am not informed. It probably was made known to him before the expiration of the forty days by Divine communication, in accordance with the saying in <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (see ver. 5). Various reasons have been assigned for this displeasure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Personal pique, lest, his prediction having failed, he should be liable to the charge of being a false prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Zeal for the honour of God, whose knowledge of the future might be discredited among the heathen, when they saw his own servant's words unfulfilled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because he saw in this conversion of Gentiles a token of the ruin of his own people, who remained always hardened and impenitent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> A mistaken patriotism, which could not endure to find mercy extended to a heathen nation which had already proved hostile to Israel and was destined to oppress it still further. This last seem to have been the real ground of his annoyance. So deep was this, that he would gladly have seen the sentence executed even after the city had repented (comp. ver. 11, "Should not I spare Nineveh," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which thou wouldst have me even now destroy?) <span class="cmt_word">He was very angry</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "was confounded." His vexation increased unto anger.

I hastened to fly before I should be reduced to seeing my mission rendered nugatory. <span class="cmt_word">For I knew.</span> Joel knew the character of God, and how that he threatened in order to arouse repentance, and that he might be able to spare (see <a href="../../par/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>). The description of God's mercy agrees with that in <a href="../../par/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a> and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-3.htm">Jonah 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take... my life from me</span> (comp. ver. 8). Jonah throughout represents himself as petty, hasty, and self-willed, prone to exaggerate matters, and easily reduced to despair. Here, because his word is not fulfilled, he wishes to die, though he will not take his own life. In a different spirit Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>) is ready to die for his people's sake, and Elijah asked for death because his zeal for God had apparently wrought no effect (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>).

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Putasne bene irasceris tu</span>? The English Version is doubtless correct. God bids him consider with himself whether his anger is reasonable. The version of the LXX., however grammatically permissible, is somewhat pointless.

It must have been before the end of the forty days that Jonah perceived that Nineveh would escape. And now, from God's expostulation with him in ver. 4, he seem to have conceived the expectation that some catastrophe would still happen; as though God had told him that he was too hasty in his judgment, that he could not know the mind of God, and that because he did not strike immediately he was not to conclude that he would not strike at all. <span class="cmt_word">On the east side of the city</span>. The opposite side to that by which he had entered, and where the high ground enabled him to overlook the town, without necessarily sharing in its destruction. <span class="cmt_word">A booth.</span> A tent constructed of branches interlaced, which did not exclude the sun (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">What would become of the city.</span> He still expected that some calamity would befall the Ninevites, perhaps with the idea that their repentance would prove so imperfect and temporary that God would punish them after all.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-6.htm">Jonah 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made <i>it</i> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief.

Jerome describes this as a shrub called in Syriac <span class="accented">elkeroa</span>, and common in the sandy regions of Palestine. It has large leaves and grows to a considerable height in a very few days, so that a mere shrub becomes quickly a small tree. The scientific name of this plant is <span class="accented">Ricinus communis</span>; in Egyptian, <span class="accented">kiki</span>; in Assyrian, <span class="accented">kukanitu.</span> A drawing of it is given in Dr Pusey's 'Commentary,' p 260. It is also known by the name of the <span class="accented">Palma Christi</span>, and from its seeds is expressed "castor oil." But it is very doubtful whether this is the plant intended. Certainly the <span class="accented">ricinus</span> is never used in the East as a protection against the sun, for which its straggling, open growth renders it unsuitable; while the gourd, as Mr. Tristram testifies ('Land of Israel,' p. 37), is used universally to form trellises for shading arbours and summer houses, and affords a most effectual screen. "Orientals," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 15), "never dream of training a castor-oil plant overs booth, or planting it for a shade, and they would have but small respect for any one who did. It is in no way adapted for that purpose, while thousands of arbours are covered with various creepers of the general gourd family." With this testimony it is well to be satisfied. Whatever the plant was, its growth was abnormal in the present ease, though the rapidity with which it developed was merely a quickening of its ordinary powers, in due accordance with its nature and character. From his grief; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "from his evils;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut</span>...  <span class="accented">protegeret eum.</span> The Hebrew word is the same as in ver. 1, and it refers, not so much to the physical discomfort occasioned by the heat, but rather to the condition of his mind, the vexation and disappointment under which he was suffering. <span class="cmt_word">We exceeding glad;</span> literally, <span class="accented">rejoiced a great joy</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint). The candour and simplicity of the writer throughout are very remarkable. He may have seen in this providential shelter an intimation that God approved of his intention to wait and see the issue. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-7.htm">Jonah 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepared</span> (see note on ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">A worm.</span> Either a single worm which punctured the stem and caused the plant to wither, or the word is used collectively, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, for "worms." A single warm night, with a moist atmosphere, will suffice to produce a host of caterpillars, which in an incredibly short time strip a plant of all its leaves. When the morning rose. At the very earliest dawn, before the actual rising of the sun (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/9-33.htm">Judges 9:33</a>). Jonah seems to have enjoyed the shelter of the gourd one whole day. The withering of the plant came about in a natural way, but was ordered by God at a certain time in order to give Jonah the intended lesson.

The word translated "vehement" is also rendered "silent," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sultry. Pusey and Hitzig rather incline to think it may mean the autumn or harvest wind. Either interpretation is suitable, as, according to Dr. Thomson, there are two kinds of sirocco, equally destructive and annoying - the violent wind, which fills the air with dust and sand; and the quiet one, when scarcely any air is stirring, but the heat is most overpowering ('The Land and the Book,' p. 536, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Beat upon the head</span>. The same word for the effect of the rays of the sun as in <a href="../../par/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a> and elsewhere.

All were immediately silent, as if they had felt an earthquake, and then exclaimed, in a dismal tone, 'The sherki is come.' This was indeed the so much-dreaded sherki, and it has continued blowing ever since with great violence from the east and northeast, the wind being heated like our Bagdad sauna, but I think softer and more relaxing. This wind is the terror of these parts." "Few European travellers," says Layard ('Nin. and Babyl.,' p. 366), "can brave the perpendicular rays of an Assyrian sun. Even the well seasoned Arab seeks the shade during the day, and journeys by night unless driven forth by necessity or the love of war" (quoted by Dr. Pusey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). He fainted (see note on Amos 8:13, where  the fame word is used of the effects of thirst: comp. <a href="../../par/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a>). His position on the east of the city (ver. 5) exposed him to the full force of the scorching sun and wind. <span class="cmt_word">Wished in himself to die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">asked for his soul to die</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "despaired of his life" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>). The expression implies that he asked God to grant him his life to do with it what he liked. In his self-will and impatience he still shows his dependence upon God. He may have had in his mind the precedent of his great master Elijah, though his spirit is very different (see note on ver. 3 above). <span class="cmt_word">Better for me to die</span>. His wish for death arose from his now assured conviction that God's mercy was extended to the heathen. He argued from the sudden withering of the gourd that he was not to stay there and see the accomplishment of his wishes, and, in his impatience and intolerance, he would rather die than behold Nineveh converted and saved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd?

The production of the gourd is attributed to Jehovah-Elohim (ver. 6), a composite name, which serves to mark the transition from Jehovah in ver. 4 to Elohim in vers. 7 and 8. Jehovah, who replies to the prophet's complaint (ver. 4), prepares the plant as Elohim the Creator, and the worm as ha-Elohim the personal God. Elohim, the Ruler of nature, sends the east wind to correct the prophet's impatience; and in ver. 10 Jehovah sums up the history and teaches the lesson to be learned from it. <span class="cmt_word">Doest thou well to be angry?</span> The same tender expostulation as in ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">I do well to be angry, even unto death.</span> I am right to be angry, so that my anger almost kills me.

This limitation would include children of three or four years old; and, taking these as one-fifth of the population, we should set the inhabitants at six hundred thousand in number.

The book ends abruptly, but its object is accomplished. Jonah is silenced; he can make no reply; he can only confess that he is entirely wrong, and that God is righteous. He learns the lesson that God would have all men saved, and that that narrow-mindedness which would exclude heathen from his kingdom is displeasing to him and alien from his design. "For thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men in order that they should repent.
