The phrase, "<span class="accented">man of</span> <span class="accented">God</span>," indicates one favored with Divine communications, and employed as God's messenger to men (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>).

These places are not mentioned as scenes of different manifestations of the Divine glory, but as indicating the extent to which the one manifestation given at Sinai reached. The light of the Divine glory that rested on Sinai was reflected also from the mountains of Seir and Paran (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He came with ten thousands of saints</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he came from ten thousands of holy ones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">out from myriads of holiness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "from his celestial seat, where myriads of angels surround his throne" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The rendering "with," though that of the Targum, LXX., and Vulgate, cannot be retained; nor does Scripture represent God as attended by angels when he comes forth to manifest his glory to men. They are represented as surrounding his throne in heaven (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), as his servants awaiting his behest, and his host that do his pleasure (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>); and God is represented as dwelling in the midst of them (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>). Hence he is represented here as coming forth from among them to manifest himself to his people. <span class="cmt_word">A fiery law</span>. There is a various reading here; instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, fire of law, many codices have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> in one word, and this is supported by the Samaritan text and other authorities, and is accepted by most critics and interpreters. It is a fatal objection to the textual reading that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is not a Semitic word, but one of Persian origin, brought by the Jews from Babylonia, and found only in the post-exilian books (<a href="../../par/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9, 13, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5, 9, 13, 16</a>); and in them as applied to the Law of God only by heathens. It is, therefore, altogether improbable that this word should be found in any Hebrew writing anterior to the Captivity. Besides, what is the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, supposing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> to mean "law?" The words cannot be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, by "fiery law;" they can only be rendered by "a fire, a law," or "a fire of law," and What either of these may mean it is not easy to see. The ancient versions vary here very considerably: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">fin dextera ejus ignea lex</span>; Targum of Onkelos, "Written by his right hand, from the midst of the fire, a law gave he to us;" Syriac, "With myriads of his saints at his right hand. He gave to them, and also caused all peoples to love them." The best Hebrew manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> as one word. The Masoretic note is, "The <span class="accented">Chatiph is</span> one word, and the <span class="accented">K'ri</span> two." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> is best explained as a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, an Aramaic word signifying to throw or dart; the Syriac , or the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, having the same signification, so that the meaning is "fire-dartings:" from his right hand went rays of fire like arrows shot forth (cf. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Israelites, to whom this manifestation was vouchsafed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <i>are</i> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; <i>every one</i> shall receive of thy words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he loved the people.</span> The proper rendering is, <span class="accented">he loveth peoples</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). This is generally understood of the tribes of Israel; but some would understand it of nations in general, on the ground that such is the proper meaning of the word, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> and other places. A reference to nations at large, however, would seem incongruous here; and the use of the word in relation to Israel in such passages as <a href="../../par/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>; Hoe. 10:14; <a href="../../par/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>, justifies the taking it so here. <span class="cmt_word">All his saints are in thy hand.</span> The people of Israel are here called God's saints, or holy ones, because they were chosen by and consecrated to him. It is not probable, as some suggest, that the angels are here intended. The change from the third person to the second is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They sat down at thy feet.</span> The verb rendered "sat down" here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) is found only in this passage, and is of uncertain meaning. Kimchi explains it as "<span class="accented">they</span> <span class="accented">united</span> or <span class="accented">assembled together to follow thy steps</span>;" Knobel makes it "they <span class="accented">wandered at thy feet</span>," and understands it of Israel's following the lead of Jehovah in the wilderness, when the ark of the covenant preceded them in their march; Gesenius and Furst, "they <span class="accented">lie down at thy feet</span>." This last is accepted by Keil, and seems to have most in its favor. <span class="cmt_word">Every one shall receive of thy words.</span> Some render here, <span class="accented">they rise up at thy words</span>; but though the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> is sometimes used intransitively, it is properly an active verb, and there seems no reason why it should not be so regarded here: <span class="accented">every one receives</span> [the singular, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span>, used distributively] <span class="accented">thy words</span>.

The Law which Moses communicated to Israel was to remain with them as the inheritance f the congregation. The Bishops' Bible and the Geneva Version have, more correctly, "for an inheritance of the congregation." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people <i>and</i> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Some refer this to Moses, but Moses was never recognized as king in Israel: he "was faithful in all his house as a servant" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>); but Jehovah alone was King (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-6.htm">Psalm 47:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jeshurun</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-5.htm">Deuteronomy 32:5</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a></div><div class="verse">Let Reuben live, and not die; and let <i>not</i> his men be few.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-25.</span> <span class="accented">- Blessings on the tribes individually</span>. With these may be compared the blessing which Jacob pronounced on his sons as representing the tribes of which they were the heads. The two resemble each other in many points; the differences are such as naturally arose from the different relations of the speakers to the objects of their address, and the changes in the condition and prospects of the tribes which during the lapse of centuries had come to pass. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let not his men be few.</span> The negative, though not expressed in the Hebrew, is to be carried into this clause from the preceding. Though the rights of primogeniture had been withdrawn from Reuben, and Jacob had declared that he should not excel, Moses here assures the tribe of continuance, and even prosperity. Their number was not to be small; which was, perhaps, said to comfort them, in view of the fact that their numbers had greatly diminished in the course of their wanderings in the desert (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/1-21.htm">Numbers 1:21</a> with Numbers 26:7). At no time, however, was this tribe numerous as compared with the others; nor was it ever distinguished either by the enterprise of its members or by the eminence of any of them in the councils of the nation or the management of affairs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-7.htm">Deuteronomy 33:7</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>is the blessing</i> of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help <i>to him</i> from his enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The blessing on Judah is in the form of prayer to Jehovah. As Jacobhad promised to Judah supremacy over his brethren and success in war, so Moses here names him next after Reuben, whose pre-eminence he had assumed, and prays for him that, going forth at the head of the tribes, he might return in triumph, being helped of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Let his hands be sufficient for him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with his hands he contendeth for it</span> (to wit, <span class="accented">his people</span>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> here is not the adj. much, enough, but the part. of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, to contend, to strive; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> is the aeons, of instrument. The rendering in the Authorized Version is grammatically possible; but the meaning thereby brought out is not in keeping with the sentiment of the passage; for if Judah's hands, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his own power and resources, were sufficient for him, what need had he of help from the Lord? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a></div><div class="verse">And of Levi he said, <i>Let</i> thy Thummim and thy Urim <i>be</i> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <i>and with</i> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - The blessing on Levi is also in the form of a prayer. In Jacob's blessing, Simeon is joined with Levi, but Moses passes him over altogether, probably because, as Jacob foretold, he was to be scattered among his brethren (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>), and so lose his tribal individuality. Simeon, however, is included in the general blessing pronounced on Israel; and as this tribe received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-9</a>), it was probably regarded as included in the blessing on that tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Thy Thummim and thy Urim</span>; <span class="accented">thy Right and thy Light</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The high priest wore the breast-plate on which these were placed when he went in before the Lord; and this is here represented as the prerogative of the whole tribe. Thy holy one; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Levi, the tribe-father, representing the whole tribe to which the blessing applies; hence in the following verses the verb passes into the plural. For "holy one," it would be better to read "pious" or "godly one;" literally, <span class="accented">the man thy pious one</span>. Some would render "the man thy favored one," or "the man of thy friendship;" but this is wholly arbitrary, the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) has no such meaning. To explain this more particularly, reference is made to the trials at <span class="cmt_word">Massah</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the waters of Meribah</span> (strife), when the people rebelled and murmured against Moses and Aaron, whereby the piety of these men was put to the test, and in them, the heads of the tribe of Levi, the whole tribe was proved. (On Massah, see <a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>; and on the waters of strife, see <a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>.) In these trials, Levi had proved himself faithful and godly, having risen up in defense of the honor of Jehovah, and in support of his covenant, though in the latter case both Moses and Aaron stumbled. <span class="cmt_word">Who said unto his father and to his mother</span>, etc. This refers to what is narrated in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, when the Levites drew their swords against their brethren at the command of Moses, to execute judgment without respect of person, because of the sin of the people in the matter of the golden calf (cf. also <a href="../../par/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, and, for the principle here implicitly commended, see <a href="../../par/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).  Because of their zealous devotion to the claims and service of the Lord, the dignity of the priesthood had been conferred on this tribe; and to them belonged the high office of being instructors of the people in Divine things, and of presenting the sacrifices of the people to the Lord. For those entrusted with such an office, nothing was more to be desired than that they should be blessed with power rightly to discharge the duties of their office, that their service should be accepted with favor, and that their enemies and haters should be foiled and rendered impotent; and for this Moses prays on their behalf.

There can be no doubt that Benjamin is the subject of this clause; to understand it of Jehovah dwelling on the shoulders of Benjamin, in the sense of having the temple, the place of his rest, within the territory of Benjamin, is too violent and far-fetched an interpretation to be admitted. In the change of subject in the three clauses of this verse, there is nothing strange, since such a change repeatedly occurs, and is found even in prose, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-13.htm">2 Samuel 11:13</a>.

There is this difference, however, between the two blessings, that in that of the patriarch it is the growth of the tribe in power and might that is chiefly contemplated; whilst in that of Moses it is the advance of the tribe in wealth, prosperity, and influence that is chiefly indicated. "Jacob described the growth of Joseph under the figure of a luxuriant branch of a fruit tree planted by the water; whilst Moses fixes his eye primarily upon the land of Joseph, and desires for him the richest productions" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For the precious things of heaven, for the dew</span>. Several codices, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5dc;</span>, "for <span class="accented">dew</span>," read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, above - "the precious things of heaven above;" and this reading, some critics of eminence adopt. Probably, however, this is only a correction, to bring this passage into accordance with <a href="../../par/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>. The Targums and the Peshito combine both readings. Instead of "<span class="accented">for</span> the precious things," it is better to read "with," etc., and so throughout vers. 13-16.

Success in enterprise, and felicity at home, are assured to both. "Although 'going out' (enterprise, labor) is attributed to Zebulun, and 'remaining in tents' (the comfortable enjoyment of life) to Issachar, in accordance with the delineation of their respective characters in the blessing of Jacob, this is to be attributed to the poetic parallelism of the clauses, and the whole is to be understood as applying to both in the sense suggested by Graf, 'Rejoice, Zebulun and Issachar, in your labor and your rest'" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">They shall call the people unto the mountain;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they shall call nations to the mountain</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the mountain of the Lord's inheritance (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-17.htm">Exodus 15:17</a>), the place of his sanctuary. <span class="cmt_word">Sacrifices of righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sacrifices offered according to God's Law, and in a manner and a spirit well pleasing to him (<a href="../../par/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>; 51:21). <span class="cmt_word">They shall suck of the abundance of the seas</span>, etc. The treasures of both sea and land should be theirs.

Though the noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> has a masc. termination, usage shows that it was the female and not the male that was thereby designated (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>, where it can hardly, be a mere synonym; and <a href="../../par/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/38-39.htm">Job 38:39</a>, where the reference to the young of the animal accords better with the lioness than with the lion, Gesenius).

The word rendered t, lawgiver," or "leader" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>), signifies primarily one who ordains or appoints, and is used in both the above senses (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>); it is here applied to Gad, because that tribe displayed such promptitude and energy at the head of the tribes in the conquest of the land, that it might be regarded as their leader. An entirely different view of the passage has been taken by some, who by the <span class="accented">mechokek</span> understand Moses as the lawgiver, and his portion as the place of his grave, which was concealed, but was within the inheritance of Gad. But it is a fatal objection to this view that not only is the word rendered "portion" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) nowhere used of a grave, but the grave of Moses on Mount Nebo was in the territory of Reuben, not in that of Gad. Gesenius renders, "The portion of (assigned by) the lawgiver was preserved." But this does not tally with the immediately preceding statement, that Gad <span class="accented">chose</span> his portion for himself; at any rate, it could not be <span class="accented">because</span> of this that he chose it. Gad chose for himself a portion on the east of Jordan, and the portion he had chosen was sacredly kept for him, though he went with his brethren to the conquest of Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">And he came with the heads of the people</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his place of marching was with the leaders; his place was at the head of the tribes (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17, 21, 32</a>, and <a href="../../par/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/4-12.htm">Joshua 4:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He executed the justice of the Lord</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he did what God required of him, obeying his commands, and thereby fulfilling all righteousness (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With Israel</span>; in the fellowship of Israel.

The proper meaning of the word is to be retained here. As the territory of Naphtali lay in the north of Canaan, and was far from the sea, the blessing here pronounced upon him must be understood generally of prosperity and felicity. He was to possess riches as of the sea, and genial and fructifying warmth as of the south.

The word rendered "shoes" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) occurs only here.
