The Hebrew verb means primarily to seduce, draw aside, or entice (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>); and in  the passive conveys the idea of wandering through being drawn away by some enticement. <span class="cmt_word">Hide thyself from them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. withdraw thyself from them, avoid noticing them or having to do with them. In any case; certainly, without fail.

In Exodus, it is specially declared that both these services are to be rendered, even though the parties are at enmity with each other, and the one is the object of hatred to the other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-5.htm">Deuteronomy 22:5</a></div><div class="verse">The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so <i>are</i> abomination unto the LORD thy God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The divinely instituted distinction between the sexes was to be sacredly observed, and, in order to this, the dress and ether things appropriate to the one were not to be used by the other. <span class="cmt_word">That which pertaineth unto a man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the apparatus</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) <span class="accented">of a man</span>, including, not dress merely, but implements, tools, weapons, and utensils. This is an ethical regulation in the interests of morality. There is no reference, as some have supposed, to the wearing of masks for the purpose of disguise, or to the practice of the priests at heathen festivals of wearing masks of their gods. Whatever tends to obliterate the distinction between the sexes tends to licentiousness; and that the one sex should assume the dress of the other has always been regarded as unnatural and indecent (comp. Seneca, 'Epist.,' 122, "Nonne videntur contra naturam vivere qui commutant cum feminis vestem;" and Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 6:252 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Quem praestare potest muller galeata pudorem<br />Quae fugit a sexu?"</span>) Such a change of vesture is here declared to be an abomination to the Lord, because of its tendency to immorality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a></div><div class="verse">If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, <i>whether they be</i> young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-28.htm">Leviticus 22:28</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>.) These precepts are designed to foster humane feeling towards the lower animals, and not less to preserve regard to that affectionate relation between parents and their young which God has established as a law in the animal world. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest prolong thy days</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-8.htm">Deuteronomy 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Still less was human life to be exposed to danger through neglect of proper precautions. The houses in Palestine, as in other parts of the East, had flat roofs, and, as these were much frequented by the inhabitants for various purposes (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>), it was necessary that a battlement or balustrade should surround the roof, in order to prevent persons falling over. Hence the direction here given. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - (Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>.) God has made distinctions in nature, and these are not to be confounded by the mixing of things distinct. The ox and the ass were chiefly used in husbandry; but, as they were of different size and strength, it was not only fitting that they should not be yoked to the same plough, but it might be cruel so to yoke them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.</div><div class="comm">

The meaning of the word is uncertain. The LXX. render by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "spurious, bad;" Aquila, by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "variously disposed, diverse." No Semitic <span class="accented">etymology</span> can be found for the word, and as the Hebrews derived the textile art from Egypt, the home of that art, the word is probably of Egyptian origin.
