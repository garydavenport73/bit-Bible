Moses, having presented to the people certain facts in their recent history which had in them a specially animating and encouraging tendency, proceeds to direct his discourse to the inculcation of duties and exhortations to obedience to the Divine enactments. This portion also of his address is of an introductory character as well as what precedes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation to the observance of the Law generally</span>. The Law was to be kept as a complete whole; nothing was to be taken from it or added to it; it comprised the commandments of Jehovah, and therefore they were not only to do it as what Moses, their leader and lawgiver, had enjoined, but to keep it as a sacred deposit, not to be altered or tampered with, and to observe it as what God their Sovereign had enacted for them. The dignity and worth of the Law are here asserted, and also its completeness as given by Moses. Any addition to it, no less than any subtraction from it, would mar its integrity and affect its perfection. Altered circumstances in process of time might, indeed, lead to the desuetude of some parts of the Mosaic enactments, and new institutions or laws might be required to meet a new condition of things, or even in that new condition to fence and sustain the primitive code; but that cede was to remain intact in the Statute-Book, and no alterations were to be made upon it that should affect its substance or nullify any of its principles. New laws and institutions appointed by God would, of course, have the same authority as those originally ordained by Moses; and such, it can hardly be doubted, were in point of fact under the Hebrew monarchy introduced by the prophets speaking in the name of God. The Law, nevertheless, was kept substantially entire. Even under the new dispensation, the Law has not been abolished. Christ, as he himself declared, came not to destroy the Law and the prophets, but to fulfill them (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The sin of the Pharisees, for which they were censured by our Lord, lay in this, that they taught for doctrines the commandments of men (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>), and had "made the commandments of God of none effect by their traditions" (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-6.htm">Matthew 15:6</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span>; rather <span class="accented">And now</span>. With this Moses passes from referring to what God had done for Israel to admonish Israel as to what they had to do as the subjects of God and the recipients of his favor. They were to give heed to all the statutes and judgments which Moses, as the servant of God, had taught them, in order that they might do them. <span class="cmt_word">Statutes</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), the things prescribed or enacted by law, whether moral, ritual, or civil; <span class="cmt_word">judgments</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), <span class="accented">rights</span>, whether public or private, all that each could claim as his due, and all he was bound to render to God or to his fellow-men as their due. These two comprehend the whole Law as binding on Israel. On the doing of these by the people depended <span class="accented">life</span>; these had been made known to them, not merely for their information, but specifically that they might do them, and thereby have life; not long life in the Promised Land alone, though this also is included (ver. 40; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>, etc.), but that higher life, that life which man lives "by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>), that spiritual life which is in God's favor (<a href="../../par/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). Enjoying this life as the fruit of obedience, they should also possess as their inheritance the laud promised to their fathers.

The phrase is frequently used of devotion to the service and worship of the true God (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-5.htm">Joshua 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, etc.); here it expresses the contrast between the conduct of those who remained faithful to Jehovah and those who forsook him to worship Baal. <span class="cmt_word">Are alive every one of you this day</span>. "Thus they that keep themselves pure in general defections, are saved from the common destruction (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>)" (Ainsworth).

Thus the Queen of Sheba heard in her distant country of the wisdom of Solomon, and came to him to commune with him of all that was in her heart (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, etc.); and many throughout the ages who were seeking after truth among the heathen, were drawn to Israel by seeing how with them was the true knowledge of God. Israel was thus exalted because God was nigh to them, ready to hear their cry and to give them what they needed; which none of the gods of the nations were or could be to their votaries; and because, in the Law which God had given them, they had such instruction and direction as no heathen nation possessed.

Therefore they were to take heed and diligently beware of forgetting the circumstances under which the Law had been received at Horeb. God had then commanded the people to be gathered together, so that they stood before the Lord, were in his manifested presence, and were made to hear his voice speaking to them from amidst the fire and the clouds that covered the mount. They had thus actual evidence and guarantee that the Law they had received was Divine; and this they were to keep in mind as long as they lived, and to communicate to their children in all coming time, that so they might fear the Lord; for on this rested that covenant which God had made with Israel, and which they were to keep as the condition of their continuing to enjoy privilege and life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy soul diligently</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

From <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, etc., and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, it is evident that the author had in view "all the dispersions which would come upon the rebellious nation in future times, even down to the dispersion under the Romans, which continues still; so that Moses contemplated the punishment in its fullest extent" (Keil).

Dispersed among the heathen, they, who had dishonored God by making an image to represent him, should be compelled to do service to mere dead idols, the work of men's hands, which not only could not hear or see, as God can, but also could not-perform even such animal functions as eating and smelling (<a href="../../par/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-9</a>).

As had been their sin, so should be their punishment; as they had dishonored God, so should they be themselves dishonored; as they had worshipped by an image him who is spirit and without form, they should be made to sink down to an utterly materialized worship, that of mere idols, the work of men's hands; as they had apostatized from the one holy and true God, they should be degraded to become the servants of abominations, objects of loathing and abhorrence (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-13.htm">Jeremiah 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>). God, however, would not utterly cast them off: if, in their misery and degradation, they should repent and turn again to him and seek him sincerely and earnestly, they should find him; for he is a merciful God, and mindful of the covenant which he swam unto their fathers (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>, etc.).

When men have apostatized from God, it is often by means of "tribulation" that they are brought to a right state of mind towards him, and to a true repentance "not to be repented of;" and to effect this is the design of all the chastisements which God sends on his own people (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-13</a>; L 4, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>, etc.).

This, however, may include the far distant future, and so points to the time when Israel shall finally return to the Lord and be saved, through the acknowledgment of him whom they despised and rejected when he came as the Messiah promised to the fathers. As St. Paul grounds the assurance of the final redemption of Israel, as a whole, on their calling of God (<a href="../../par/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26-29</a>), so Moses here sees in God's covenant the ground of the ever-watchful care and grace of God to Israel, and the security of their final restoration as a nation.

Inasmuch as God had loved their fathers, the patriarchs, and had chosen them their descendants to be his people, and had delivered them out of Egypt, that he might establish them in the Promised Land, having driven out thence nations  mightier than they, therefore were they to consider in their heart and acknowledge that Jehovah alone is God, and that in the wide universe there is no other. The apodosis in this sentence begins at ver. 39, and not, as in the Authorized Version, at "he chose," in ver. 37, nor at "brought thee," as some suggest. <span class="cmt_word">Because he loved thy fathers, and chose his</span> [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

A short historical notice is here inserted, probably because it was during the interval between the first and second addresses of Moses that he carried into effect the Divine command to appoint cities of refuge for the manslayer (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9</a>, etc.; cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>). This notice, therefore, is here in its proper place in the order of the narrative. That Moses should, just at this stage, have made this appointment was fitting and proper, seeing he had been urging on the people obedience to the Divine statutes and commandments, and had represented their conquest of the territory of Sihon and Og as an earnest of their ultimate possession of the whole land of the Amorites. By appointing these cities, Moses gave an example of obedience to God's injunction, and, at the same time, not only asserted on the part of Israel a right of proprietorship in this trans-Jordanic territory, but assumed as certain that, on the ether side of Jordan also, the same right of proprietorship should be possessed and exercised by Israel in the fulfilling of the whole law concerning cities of refuge (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-1.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1</a>, etc.). That this section belongs properly to <a href="../../par/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35, 36</a>, and has been interpolated here by some later hand, is a pure assumption, for which there is no ground. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On this side Jordan</span>; beyond Jordan, more expressly defined as toward the sun rising, viz. on the east of that river.
