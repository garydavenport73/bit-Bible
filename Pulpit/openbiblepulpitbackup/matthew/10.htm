Parallel passages: <a href="../../par/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-19</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13-16</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>). This Commentary upon St. Luke deals so fully both with the list as a whole and with the separate names that it will not be necessary to say much here. Observe that the general agreement in arrangement points to some common basis underlying all four accounts; also that of these the one found in the Acts is the briefest, giving little more than the bare names; and that that found in our Gospel, on the contrary, is the fullest, containing, with two exceptions (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), the details mentioned in one or other of the parallels, and adding two of its own. It mentions, in one instance or more, the parentage (Zebedee, Alphaeus), the relationship ("his brother...  his brother"), the birthplace (Kerioth), the earlier occupation and religious standpoint ("publican...  Zealot"), and, with a bare hint at the beginning (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), but a clear statement at the end, the after-history ("first... who also betrayed him") of the apostles. The two omissions are the fact that our Lord added the names of Peter (parallels, but really given earlier, <a href="../../par/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>) and Boanerges (Mark). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">the names,</span> In the parallels part of the word "names" is found as a verb, "whom also he named apostles;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the naming there refers, not to the individuals, but to their office. Is the form found in our Gospel an "accidental" rearrangement due to a reminiscence that the word "name" occurred in the earliest source, or is it possible that the two facts are connected, and that the individuals received a new name when they definitely entered on a new office? That they should have received a new name seems <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">priori</span> not improbable, but the evidence is very slight. "Peter" is a clear case, for though the name <span class="accented">was</span> given earlier, it would receive a new application now, and perhaps was now again expressly given (cf. parallel passages); and other cases may be St. Matthew (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 21.) and possibly St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddaeus. Mark expressly says that the term "<span class="accented">Boanerges"</span> was given to the sons of Zebedee; but as there is no evidence that either St. James or St. John was afterwards known by this name, it need not have been a name in the same sense in which the others were. Observe the formal order of the first words of this verse (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). Did the author of the Gospel take them from the heading of a section that already contained the names in order? If so the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> would probably not have existed there, and it is worth noting that the original hand of D, the manuscript that is of special value for Palestinian tradition, omits it. <span class="cmt_word">Of the twelve</span> (ver. 1, note) <span class="cmt_word">apostles</span> (ver. 5, note) <span class="cmt_word">are these: The first</span>. This, perhaps, refers to the order of call, <a href="../../par/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a> (Nosgen), but more probably to the leading position that St. Peter held among the twelve.

If the word "Thaddaeus" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>) was as seems likely (for Edersheim's connexion of it with <span class="accented">todah</span>, "praise," is based on what is apparently a mere play of words in Talm.

The similarity of sound would help towards this, even if another derivation that seems possible, "the Fiery" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "kindle"), be the true one. In the latter case the appellation, "Jude the Zealot" (Old Latin), may rest on something more than a mistaken interpretation of the parallel passage in Luke. In Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' it is said that "this name [Lebbaeus] is apparently due to an early attempt to bring Levi (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) the publican (<a href="../../par/luke/5-27.htm">Luke 5:27</a>) within the Twelve, it being assumed that his call was to apostleship just as in <a href="../../par/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> is changed in Western texts to <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, because <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> follows, and it was assumed that the son of Halphseus elsewhere named as one of the Twelve must be meant.

The connexion and development of thought in this important charge is exceedingly difficult to perceive, and has been understood in many ways. Perhaps that most generally accepted in this country is Alford's, according to which the charge is divided into three sections - the first (vers. 5-15) referring to the mission to the cities of Israel; the second (vers. 16-23) to the general mission of the apostles as developing itself, after the Lord should be taken from them, in preaching to Jews and Gentiles, ending with the close of the apostolic period in the narrower sense (ver. 23 referring primarily to the destruction of Jerusalem); the third (vers. 24-42) spoken directly of all the disciples of the Lord, concluding with the last great reward. But this threefold historical arrangement seems to be little more than fanciful, the basis of truth Underlying it probably being that the charge in its present form is due to the writer of the Gospel (nor to our Lord directly), who desired not only to record what our Lord said at the time of this mission, but also to incorporate other sayings of his that bore upon similar work, and thus to give such a summary of our Lord's utterances as would be of special use to preachers of the gospel, irrespective of place or time. Observe that ch. 5. - vii, referred to believers in their private capacity - laying stress on the relation that they were to hold to the religion of the day - while this chapter refers to them as representing Christ to the world. The original basis of the commission was addressed to men called to give their whole time to this work, but as the chapter stands it applies to all believers in their  capacity of witnesses for Christ. The ministerial function of preaching committed to men selected for it is only an accentuation of one of the duties expected from all Christ's followers. The development of thought in the chapter appears to be as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The external conditions of conveying Christ's message, with special reference to the immediate occasion (vers. 5<span class="accented">b</span> - 15). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The internal conditions (vers. 16-39). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 16-23: Though surrounded by enemies, you must conduct yourselves with calmness (ver. 19); with endurance (ver. 22); with wisdom (ver. 23). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Vers. 24-33: Remembering that fellowship with me in suffering is essential to fellowship with me in glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Vers. 34-39: Such fellowship with me will cost separation from the dearest on earth, yet its reward is great. 3.

Had they accepted it, they would have become the great factors in the evangelization of the Gentiles (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12, 15</a>); as they rejected it, it was necessary that the offer should, apart from them, be made to others (<a href="../../par/acts/28-28.htm">Acts 28:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The apostles were as yet in no fit state spiritually to carry the message beyond their own nation, and the facts which they were in a position to proclaim might, when proclaimed alone, have proved a stumbling-block to the after-acceptance by Gentiles and Samaritaus of a fuller and therefore truer message (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Therefore they are now bid perform their present duty without turning away from it, and, as we may add, will-out anticipating their entrance upon a wider sphere. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Go not</span>. This would be outside your course (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). In the Greek, however, the following words receive the <span class="accented">emphasis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Into the</span> (<span class="accented">any</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">way of the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> These words are generally understood to mean "into any road that would lead to Gentile lands or districts." So Tyndale, "Go not into the wayes that leade to the gentyls." (For this genitive of direction, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/4-15.htm">Matthew 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and perhaps, Judith 5:14.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Weiss, 'Matthaus-ev.,' takes them as equivalent to "into any street in a heathen land," making the genitives, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, both possessive. There are serious objections to these two interpretations; to the first, that the genitives are then used in different senses; to the second, that it suggests something altogether outside the Israelitish border. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Is not a third interpretation possible - to consider flint our Lord had in his mind the parts of towns, otherwise Jewish, which were inhabited by heathen, just as, in the days of Omri and Ahab, such parts were assigned to Syrians in Samaria, and to Israelites in Damascus, or in modern times to Jews in Christian towns? We have not, indeed, direct evidence of Gentiles, during the time of our Lord, thus living in separate streets, but with the Jewish aversion to even letting them houses and to having more to do with them than possible (cf. Schurer, II. 1:51-56), it would seem probable that, without any formal arrangement being made, the result would be separation of this kind. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is not used elsewhere in this sense in the New Testament, but a comparison of passages in the LXX. seems to justify our so interpreting it. For <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>, means such streets, and the LXX. for this is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke), yet <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, in the sense of "streets," is often elsewhere rendered by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-17.htm">Jeremiah 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a>). Compare especially <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>, "in the streets of Ascalon," where, for the common text, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Lucian's reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The expression thus means - Go not off into any quarter (of such towns as you may come across) inhabited by Gentiles, and (both in complete parallelism and with perfect accuracy, for Samaritans dwelt alone) into any city of Samaritans enter ye not. <span class="cmt_word">And into any city</span>. In the Greek both clauses are in the same order, the verb coming last. It will be noticed that the Revised Version has transposed both for the sake of uniformity. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Samaritans</span>. By <span class="accented">descent</span>, a mixed race, from the intermingling of the remnants of the Israelitish population more especially with the heathen colonists introduced by the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>); by <span class="accented">religion</span>, so far Israelite as to have accepted the Pentateuch, and to have maintained the observance of circumcision, the sabbath, and the annual festivals. Both sides of their  connexion with Israel seem to have contributed to their being placed by the Mishna between Jews and Gentiles (cf. further, Schurer, II. 1:5, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Enter ye not</span>. A slight turning away would sometimes bring them to Gentile quarters; but into a Samaritan town they would have definitely and purposely to enter. Observe that our Lord himself so far extended his own practice as not to refuse to take the opportunity of preaching to a Samaritan woman when it presented itself, and further followed up the work thus begun by continuing two days in her village (<a href="../../par/john/4-40.htm">John 4:40</a>). But the nature of the exception proves the rule.

There is no connotation of foresight in the word itself, but only of acquisition. Observe that the apostles are not forbidden to take what they already have. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' shows that travellers ordinarily took with them a staff, a purse, shoes, a wallet, and sometimes a book of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Neither gold, nor silver, nor brass</span>. The <span class="accented">brass</span> would be the copper coinage of the Herods (examples are figured in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' 2. p. 413), which alone might be struck by them; or some of the Greek imperial coins, especially those struck at Antioch. The <span class="accented">silver</span>, either Greek imperial tetradrachms or Roman denarii of a quarter their weight, didrachms having fallen into disuse; only certain free cities were allowed to coin silver. The <span class="accented">gold</span>, as Palestine was a subject province, must have been coined at Rome, for she retained the coining of gold entirely in her own hands (cf. Madden's 'Coins of the Jews,' pp. 107, 290, ft., edit. 1881; and It. S. Peele, in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' <span class="accented">s.vv.</span> "Money," "Stater;" further, see ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In your purses</span>; literally, <span class="accented">girdles</span>, which in the East often serve as purses. This prohibition may have been suggested by the last words of ver. 8, but can hardly refer to them. It seems to regard the journey only (cf. parallel passages). <span class="cmt_word">Nor scrip</span>; no <span class="accented">wallet</span> (Revised Version). At the present time, "all shepherds have them, and they are the farmer's universal <span class="accented">vade-mecum.</span> They are merely the skins of kids stripped off whole, and tanned by a very simple process" (Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 345, edit. 1887, where a picture of one is given). But they might be made even of fish-skin (Mishna, 'Kelim,' 24:11). Because of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>, an haggada says that David's money was stamped with a staff and wallet on one side, and a tower on the other ('B'resh..R.,' &sect; 39, in Levy, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>  <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your journey</span>. The clause is to be joined with "scrip" only. <span class="cmt_word">Neither two coats</span>. A second for sabbaths and festivals. For the rabbinic rule insisted upon a different coat for these days from that ordinarily worn. To the objection of poor disciples, that they had but one garment for sabbath and week-day alike, R. Samlai said that they must at least change the way in which they wore it (Talm. Jeremiah. 'Pea.,' 8:7 [S], in Hamburger, 'Realencycl.,' 2. p. 642. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shoes</span>. The parallel passage, <a href="../../par/mark/6-9.htm">Mark 6:9</a>, has. "but <span class="accented">to go</span> shod with sandals" (Revised Version). This is, perhaps, a case of verbal inaccuracy, but as it is impossible to suppose that our Lord can have wished his disciples to go without the ordinary protection to the feet, or that the author of this Gospel, accustomed, on any theory, to Eastern modes of life, can have intended to credit him with such a wish, some other explanation of the verbal discrepancy must be looked for. The true explanation is probably this - The rabbis insisted so strongly on a man never appearing barefooted: "Let a man sell the beams of his house and buy shoes for his feet" (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 129<span class="accented">a</span>), that it is very possible that a second pair was often carried in ease of need. it is this that our Lord forbids. On the other hand, Jews did not carry one pair for sabbath and another for week-days (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Sabb.,' 6:2). Some commentators escape the difficulty by distinguishing between "shoes" and "sandals;" but it is very doubtful if the usage of the words is always so exact that one term excludes the other. <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet staves</span>; <span class="accented">nor staff</span> (Revised Version). The plural, both here (Stephen) and in <a href="../../par/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3</a> (Received Text), is a clumsy attempt to harmonize with <a href="../../par/mark/6.htm">Mark 6</a>.8, where our Lord bids the twelve take nothing "save a staff only." The difference between the two reports of our Lord's words has been magnified by many commentators into a contradiction. But this is not the true state of the case. For it would be so extraordinary and apparently so useless an order to forbid their having a staff, that it is hard to suppose this to have been the meaning of his words as <span class="accented">reported</span> here. His thought in vers. 9, 10 is rather that they were to make no preparation, for their wants should be supplied, and that even if they had not a staff they were not to take the trouble to procure one. St. Mark's account only so far differs that he assumes that they will st least have a staff already. Observe, however, that no stress can be placed on the difference of the verbs here and in Mark, for in this respect Mark and Luke agree. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the workman</span>; <span class="accented">labourer</span> (Revised Version); thus connecting the utterance closely with <a href="../../par/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37, 38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Is worthy of his meat</span>. The disciples may therefore expect that it will be provided for them by those to whom they minister (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, of the seventy), and indirectly by the Master whom they serve (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-38.htm">Matthew 9:38</a>). <span class="accented">Meat</span>; <span class="accented">food</span> (Revised Version). In all but most highly organized systems of society, this is an important (frequently the most important) part of the day labourer's wages. Hence not unnaturally "<span class="accented">wages"</span> is found in the form of the sayings given by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>). Probably our Lord's words became a current proverb in Christian circles, the original word "<span class="accented">food"</span> being modified to suit the more general circumstances of life. Clem. Romans, &sect; 31, recalls the Matthaean form, "The good workman receiveth the bread of his work with boldness." Epiphanius gives a kind of confla-tion, containing the further thought that if the workman receives his food he must be content: "The workman is worthy of his hire, and sufficient to him that works is his food." Resch ('Agrapha,' pp. 97, 140) connects this form of the saying with the practice of giving only food to the travelling "apostles" and prophets of the sub-apostolic age ('Did.,' &sect; 11.). Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 2:76) suggests that if our Lord's original word was <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, it would explain the origin of both Matthew and Luke; but it seems very doubtful it' it really ever means "<span class="accented">wages."</span> Two patristic remarks are worth quoting: the first from Origen ('Cram. Cat.'), "In saying <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, ('food') he forbade <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> ('luxury');" the second from St. Gregory the Great (in Ford), "Priests ought to consider how criminal and punishable a thing it is to receive the fruit of labour, without labour."

St. Luke's "Go not from house to house" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>). It is, on the other hand, quite unnecessary to see here, with Meyer and Weiss, a prohibition to go to the synagogues or indeed to anywhere else where they could gain a hearing during their stay.

App. 11.) thus summarizes the enactments on Jewish scourging as recorded in the Mishna ('Makkoth'): "Even a single Jewish scourging might well entitle any man to be regarded as a martyr. Thirty-nine blows were inflicted, unless, indeed, it was found that the strength of the patient was too much exhausted to admit of his receiving the full number. Both of his bands were tied to what is sometimes called a column. but which was in reality a stake a cubit and a half high. The public officer then tore down his robe until his breast was laid bare. The executioner stood on a stone behind the criminal. The scourge consisted of two thongs, one of which was composed of four strands of calf's skin, and one or two strands of ass's skin, which passed through a hole in a handle. The executioner, who was ordinarily the <span class="accented">Chazzan</span> of the synagogue, could thus shorten or lengthen them at will, so as not to strike too low. The prisoner bent to receive the blows, which were inflicted with one hand, but with all the force of the striker, thirteen on the breast, thirteen on the right and thirteen on the left shoulder. While the punishment was going on, the chief judge read aloud <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58, 59</a>, 'If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God; then the Lord will make thy plagues ["strokes"] wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed.' He then read <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>, 'Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that  ye may prosper in all ye do;' and lastly, <a href="../../par/psalms/78-38.htm">Psalm 78:38, 39</a>, 'But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away. and did not stir up all his wrath.' If the punishment was not over by the time that these three passages were read, they were again repeated, and so timed as to end exactly with the punishment itself Meanwhile a second judge numbered the blows, and a third before each blow exclaimed, '<span class="accented">Hakkehu</span> ('strike him') The severity of the pain may best be estimated by the brief addition, ' <span class="accented">If the criminal die under the infliction</span>, the executioner is not accounted guilty unless he gives by mistake a single blow too many, in which case he is banished.'"

Not every one shall acquire the technical name of "righteous," but those who help such a man shall share his reward (ver. 4l); even the smallest kindnesses shall not be unrewarded (ver. 42). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth you receiveth me</span>. "A man's messenger is as himself" (Mishna, 'Berach.,' 5:5). Yet, as Bengel says, "Non <span class="accented">mode tantundem est</span>, <span class="accented">ac si me reciperet.</span> <span class="accented">sed severn me recipit."</span> Ford quotes from Tertullian ('De Orat.,' &sect; 26), "A brother that hath entered into thine house, dismiss not without prayer. 'Thou hast seen,' saith he, 'thy brother; thou hast seen thy Lord.'" The same <span class="accented">legion</span> is found twice in Clem. Alex. (cf. Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 296). (For an extension of the thought to bishops, cf. Ign., ' Ephesians,' &sect; 6.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a></div><div class="verse">He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - Matthew only. The whole verso recalls Jewish Christianity; it was hardly likely to have been remembered outside Jewish Christian circles. <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth a prophet</span>. One upon whom the mantle of the old prophets might in any sense he said to have fallen. The saying was probably <span class="accented">recorded</span> with special thought of the Christian peripatetic "prophets," who are brought before us so vividly in the 'Didache.' <span class="cmt_word">In the name of a prophet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). In late Hebrew and in Aramaic the word for "name" passed into little more than a preposition, just as the word for "face "had already passed (and so the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="../../par/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>). Here, however, this is hardly the case, the word appearing to retain its idea of both name and corresponding position. The preposition may mean <span class="accented">either</span> receive him into the position of a prophet, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into the treatment with which a prophet should be received; <span class="accented">or</span>, simply, receive him at the rank and standing of a prophet (<a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>). Anyhow, it is in contrast to receiving him out of mere human compassion or ordinary friendliness. The reception is to have regard to that which the name implies, for the sake of the cause that the prophet represents. <span class="cmt_word">Shall receive a prophet's reward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall share in the reward of that work in which by his kindness to the prophet he so tar takes part. Thus the widow of Sarepta shared in the blessing given to Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). (On <span class="accented">reward</span>, see <a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>, note.) Observe that not the action, but the motive for the action, is made all-important. It is a matter of faith, not of works (cf Nosgen). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">he that receiveth a righteous man</span>. <span class="accented">A righteous man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one who is punctilious in performing all the details of the revealed will of God (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>, note; <a href="../../par/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-6.htm">James 5:6</a>). This word also is used in a quasi-Jewish sense, and points back to the time when Jewish Christians performed, not only the law as expounded in the sermon on the mount, but also those external rites and observances which had been commanded them as Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>). Among such Jewish Christians some would he especially noticeable for their regard to these things (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> James the "Just," or "Righteous"), and it is to one of these that the epithet here refers.

It is evident, from a comparison of ver. 41, that the two titles refer to one and the same person. Christ, using his own term, calls his followers "little ones;" using the term of others, he calls them "disciples." <span class="accented">Little ones.</span> Partly a word of personal endearment (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>); partly a comparison with those mentioned in ver. 41. He is now speaking of one who is not distinguished from other believers by the reception of extraordinary Divine gifts, or by special zeal and holiness, but is only an ordinary disciple. In <a href="../../par/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a> the term is used directly of children, but in <a href="../../par/luke/17-2.htm">Luke 17:2</a>, and probably in <a href="../../par/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41, 42</a>, it is used metaphorically. <span class="cmt_word">A cup of cold water only</span>. Observe that "if the ' cup of cold water' is not to lose its reward, it must be proffered when he who gives it has nothing better to give" (H. Melvill, in Exell, on ver. 41). <span class="cmt_word">In the name of a disciple</span> (ver. 41, note). <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his reward</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>). <span class="accented">Lose</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). Does the Western reading, "His reward shall in no wise perish," indicate the <span class="accented">unending</span> duration of heavenly bliss, or is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, there a synonym for the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> of Ecclus. 2:8?
