The office of high priest had originally been held for life; but of late the civil power had often deposed one and appointed another, so that there were at times many who had held the post, and who, as well as their deputies, and the heads of the courses, claimed the title of chief priest. These were all members of the Sanhedrim  And the scribes, These words are omitted on very good authority by many modern editors. They are not found in the Vulgate, though they occur in the parallel passages in the other synoptists. If genuine, they, in connection with "elders" and "priests," would signify that all the elements of the Sanhedrin were present at this council. <span class="cmt_word">The palace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the high priest.</span> This, then, was not a formal meeting, or it would have been held in the hall Gazith, "the hall of hewn stones," on the south side of the court of the priests. It was assembled in the court of the high priest's house, because it comprised persons who were not Sanhedrists, such as temple officials, and connections of the high priest, forming what was known as the priestly council, which was the official medium between the Roman authorities and the people. <span class="cmt_word">Who was called Caiaphas.</span> Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02. 2) speaks of him as "Joseph, who is also Caiaphas;" hence the way in which he is introduced in the present passage. He had been elevated to his high post by the Romans, who found in him a submissive tool. His father-in-law. Annas had been appointed by Quirinius, but after nine years had been deposed; he was succeeded in turn by Ismael, Eleazar son of Annas, Simon, and fourthly by Caiaphas, who superseded his immediate predecessor by the favour of the procurator Valerius Gratus, the tenant of the office before Pontius Pilate. The ex-high priest, Annas, was counted still by some rigorists as holding the office, and he appears to have possessed high authority (see <a href="../../par/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-6.htm">Acts 4:6</a>).

The assembled multitudes did not leave the city until the close of the octave, so the danger of a rising was not removed till then. The rulers well knew the stern temper of Pilate the procurator, who was prepared to crush any popular movement with the strong hand, and at festival times had always his soldiers ready to hurl upon the mob at the slightest provication, and to deal indiscriminate slaughter. Hence arose the plan of a clandestine apprehension. It was, indeed, the custom to execute great criminals at the time of the chief festivals, in order to impress the spectacle of retribution upon the greatest number; but in the case of Jesus, after what had occurred during the last few days, and when Jerusalem was filled with Galilaeans, who might naturally favour their countryman's pretensions, it was deemed dangerous to make any open attack. Their fears were relieved in the most unexpected manner by the appearance of Judas among them (ver. 14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a></div><div class="verse">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The anointing at Bethany.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3-9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1-8</a>.) This parenthetical episode is introduced by the two synoptists out of its chronological order, with the view of indicating the immediate cause of Judas's resolution to betray his Master, the issue of which they proceed to narrate (see on ver. 14). This anointing must not be confounded with that related by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, etc.), where the scene, the time, and the actor were different, and the significance was of a very inferior nature. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus was in Bethany.</span> St. John tells us that the incident took place six days before the Passover, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the Saturday preceding Palm Sunday. It is St. Matthew's custom to describe events not always in their historical sequence, but according to some logical or spiritual connection which in his mind overrides considerations of time or place. (For Bethany, see on Matthew 21:1.) <span class="cmt_word">Simon the leper</span>. Not that he was a leper now, but either the appellation was hereditary, in reference to some such malady inflicted on his family, or he himself, having been cured by Christ, retained the name in memory of his cleansing. So St. Matthew is called "the publican" after he had relinquished his obnoxious business (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>), and the revived man is termed "the dead" (<a href="../../par/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a>). The frequency of the name Simon among the Jews rendered the addition of a surname expedient; thus we have Simon the Cananite, Simon the tanner, Simon Bar-john, etc. Nothing certain is known about this person. Tradition makes him father of Lazarus or husband of Martha. That he was connected with the holy family of Bethany, either by relationship or close friendship, seems to be well established. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i>at meat</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A woman.</span> St. John identifies her as Mary the sister of Lazarus and Martha. Why the synoptists omit her name is not known; it is equally uncertain why St. John makes no mention of Simon. None of the synoptists notice Lazarus, though St. Luke names Martha and Mary (<a href="../../par/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38, 39</a>). It may have been at the  time a matter of prudence or delicacy not to draw attention to them by name. But there is no discrepancy. One narrative supplements the other, and it is best to be thankful for what we have, and not to be over curious concerning points not explained. <span class="cmt_word">An alabaster box</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). A cruse or flask made of alabaster, which is a white calcareous spar resembling marble, but setter and more easily worked. These cruses were generally round shaped, with a long narrow neck, the orifice of which was sealed. It may be the breaking of this seal to which St. Mark refers in his account (<a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>), when he says that "she brake the box." <span class="cmt_word">Very precious ointment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). St. Mark calls it "pistic nard," rendered in our version "spikenard." The word in our text seems to be used for any salve or ointment which contained myrrh as one of its ingredients. Nard is found in Syria, the Himalayas, and other parts of India. From its root a strong scented unguent was made, which, being imported from a long distance, was very costly. <span class="cmt_word">Poured it on his head.</span> It is to be noted that in the original there is no "it" after "poured;" so there is nothing to imply that the whole was poured upon his head. This helps to reconcile this account with that of the fourth evangelist (Morison). St. John tells that she anointed his feet, which was unusual; she first anointed his head, and then his feet, wiping the latter with her long flowing hair. Anointing the head was not an uncommon way of honouring distinguished guests; but Mary had another thought in her mind which the Lord discerned (ver. 12<span class="cmt_word">). As he sat</span> at meat; <span class="accented">as he reclined at table.</span> The Jews had adopted the Roman mode of eating (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-10.htm">Matthew 22:10</a>, where the word rendered "guests" is "the recumbent"). St. Matthew does not mention that a special supper was arranged for him (<a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>), as if to do him honour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">But when his disciples saw <i>it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i>is</i> this waste?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When his disciples saw it.</span> St. John states that the objection came originally from Judas. Doubtless, when it was once made, many concurred in it, not, indeed, from Judas's selfish motive (<a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>), but because they did not clearly apprehend the Divinity of Christ, nor the unspeakable sacredness of that body which was about to be the instrument of man's redemption. <span class="cmt_word">To what purpose is this waste</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)pw/leia</span>)? Wordsworth notes that Judas is called <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>). A fitting question truly for him to ask! The objectors saw no practical usefulness in the expenditure of this costly substance. If it was thought proper to show respect to their Master, a much inferior oil would have equally effected this purpose, or a few drops of the more precious unguent would have sufficed. So nowadays one hears complaints of money being expended in the rich decoration of churches, etc., when there are starving multitudes whom it would have relieved. But God himself has sanctioned the use of precious materials and of exquisite workmanship in temples built in his honour, and in the accessories of his public worship; the interests of the poor are not overlooked in such expenditure; they who give of their substance for such purposes are just those who feel all their responsibilities, and know that they serve Christ in ministering to his needy members. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-9.htm">Matthew 26:9</a></div><div class="verse">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Might have been sold for much.</span> According to St. John, Judas had accurately estimated the value of the ointment at 300 denarii, equal to about &pound;9 of our money. When we remember that one denarius represented the daily wages of a labouring man (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>), we see that the cost was very large. <span class="cmt_word">Given to the poor.</span> And this "much" given to the poor. But piety is not shown only in giving alms; the honour of God has a superior claim. And Mary was rich, and quite able to afford this offering without neglecting her almsgiving. "How often does charity serve as a cloak for covetousness! We must not neglect what we owe to Jesus Christ under pretence of what we owe his members. Men count as wasted what is expended in the outer worship of God, when they love neither God nor his worship. Jesus Christ authorizes it by accepting it at the very instant in which he was establishing religion by a worship the most spiritual and inward" (Quesnel).

Doubtless, their remarks had reached Mary's ears, and annoyed and embarrassed her. <span class="cmt_word">For she hath wrought a good work upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. A work that proved her zeal, reverence, and faith. Mary had always been devout, contemplative, loving. She had learned much at the grave of Lazarus; she was full of gratitude at the wonderful restoration of her brother's life; she had often heard Christ speak of his decease, and knew that it was close at ham], realizing that which the chosen apostles were still slow to believe; so she was minded to make this costly offering. And Christ saw her motive, and graciously accepted it.

This was in  strict accordance with the old Law: "The poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy in thy land" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>).

When he speaks of being with his Church always to the end, he is speaking of his Divine presence. His human body, his body of humiliation, was removed from the sight and touch of men, and he could no longer be received and welcomed and succoured as heretofore. In a different and far more effectual mode he would visit his faithful servants by a spiritual presence which should never fail or be withdrawn. To the objectors he would say, "You will no longer have opportunity of honouring me in my human form; why, then, do you grudge the homage now paid me for the last time?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-12.htm">Matthew 26:12</a></div><div class="verse">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i>it</i> for my burial.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On my body, she did it for my burial</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">to prepare me for burial</span>).

She desired to offer what she could (<a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>) of the offices and attentions due to the corpse of a beloved and revered Friend. Christ interpreted her act, and gave it a solemn significance. By this effusion of the precious unguent site anticipated the embalming of the Lord's body; she showed her reverence for that body which was to be given for the life of the world not many days hence. The full meaning of the mystery of which she was the instrument Mary did not comprehend, but what she had consciously done received a wonderful commendation from the Lord, which has no parallel in the Gospel history.

We may here quote the eloquent comment of Chrysostom, who, however, unreasonably identifies Mary with the sinner who previously anointed Jesus. "Who then proclaimed if, and caused it to be spread abroad? It was the power of him who is speaking these words. And while of countless kings and generals the noble exploits, even of those whose memorials remain, have sunk into silence; and having overthrown cities, and encompassed them with walls, and set up trophies, and enslaved many nations, they are not known so much as by hearsay, nor by name, though they have both set up statues, and established laws; yet that a woman who was a harlot poured out oil in the house of some leper, in the presence of ten men, - this all men celebrate throughout the world; and so great a time has passed, and yet the memory of that which was done hath not faded away, but alike Persians and Indians, Scythians and Thracians, and Sarmatians, and the race or the Moors, and they that inhabit the British Islands, spread abroad that which was done secretly in a house by a woman" ('Ham. 80. in Matthew').

This seems to be signified by the synoptists' introduction of the transaction at Bethany immediately before the account of Judas's infamous bargain (see preliminary note on vers. 6-13). <span class="cmt_word">One of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot.</span> That he was one of the twelve, the chosen companions of Christ, emphasizes his crime, makes it more amazing and more heinous. To witness the daily life of Christ, to behold his miracles of mercy, to listen to his heavenly teaching, to hear his stern denunciations of such sins as covetousness and hypocrisy, and in spite of all to bargain with his bitterest enemies for his betrayal, reveals a depth of perverse wickedness which is simply appalling. Well may the evangelist say that Satan entered into Judas (<a href="../../par/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3</a>); it was the devil's work he was doing; he followed this evil inspiration, and thought not whither it would lead him. <span class="cmt_word">Went unto the chief priests.</span> Their hostility was no secret. Judas and everybody knew of their hatred of Jesus, and of their attempts to get him into their power; he saw his way to  carrying out his purpose, and making of it some pecuniary gain. We are not to suppose that this miserable man sank all at once to this depth of iniquity. <span class="accented">Nemo repente fit turpissimus</span>. Though the descent to Avernus be easy, it is gradual; it has its steps and pauses, its allurements and checks. Modern criticism has endeavoured to minimize the crime of Judas, or even to regard him as a hero misunderstood; but the facts are entirely in favour of the traditional view. We can trace the path by which the apostle developed into the traitor, by studying the hints which the Gospels afford. He was probably at first fairly sincere in attaching himself to Christ's company. Being a man of business capacity and skill in the management of money matters, he was appointed treasurer of the little funds at the disposal of Christ and his followers. Half-hearted and self-seeking, his undertaking this office was a snare to which he easily fell a victim. He began by petty peculations, which were not discovered by his comrades (<a href="../../par/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>), though he must often have felt an uneasy apprehension that his Master saw through him, and that many of his warnings were directed at him (see <a href="../../par/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64, 70, 71</a>). This feeling lessened the love for Jesus, though it did not drive him to open apostasy. He had admitted the demon of covetousness to his breast, and he now adhered to Christ for the hope of satisfying greed and worldly ambition. The teaching and miracles of Christ had no marked influence on such a disposition, softened not his hard heart, effected no change in his evil and selfish desires. And when he saw his hopes disappointed, when he heard Christ's announcement of his speedy death, which his knowledge of the rulers' animosity rendered only too certain, his only feeling was hatred and disgust. The transient expectations raised by the triumphal entry were not fulfilled; there was no assumption of the earthly conqueror's part, there were no rewards for Christ's followers, nothing but enmity and threatening danger on every side. Judas, seeing all this, perceiving that no worldly advantage would be gained by fidelity to the losing side, determined to make what profit he could under present circumstances. Not with the mistaken idea of forcing Christ to declare himself, and to put himself at the head of a popular movement, nor with any notion of Christ miraculously saving himself from his enemies' hands, but simply from sordid love of gain, he made his infamous offer to the chief priests. It was just when they were in perplexity, and had determined on nothing except that the arrest and the condemnation were not to take place during the feast, that Judas was introduced into the assembly. No wonder "they were glad" (<a href="../../par/mark/14-11.htm">Mark 14:11</a>); here was a solution of the contemplated difficulty; they need have no fear of a rising in favour of Christ; if among his chosen followers some were disaffected, and one was ready to betray him, they might work their will, when he was once quietly apprehended, without any danger of rescue and disturbance (see on Matthew 27:3).

Thirty shekels of the sanctuary, equivalent to &pound;3 15s. of our money. This was the legal price of a slave gored by an ox (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>), and must have been considered by the traitor but a poor reward for his crime. He found the rulers as covetous as himself, and disposed to treat both him and his Master with the utmost contempt. Christ had taken upon him the form of a bondservant, and was here reckoned as such. The transaction had been typically shadowed forth when another Judas sold his brother Joseph for twenty pieces of silver (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27, 28</a>); when Ahithophel gave counsel against David, his familiar friend (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16.htm">2 Samuel 16</a>.); and when Zechariah wrote, "I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed [<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint] for my price thirty pieces of silver" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12</a>). St. Matthew alone of the evangelists mentions the exact price agreed upon. It may have come naturally to the "publican" to observe the pecuniary aspect of the transaction.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17</a></div><div class="verse">Now the first <i>day</i> of the <i>feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="accented">Preparation for the Paschal Sapper.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-7.htm">Luke 22:7-13</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread;</span> literally, <span class="accented">on the first day of Unleavened Bread.</span> We have arrived at the Thursday in the Holy Week, Nisan 13. Wednesday had been spent in retirement at Bethany, and no acts or sayings of Christ on that day are recorded. The festival actually began at sunset of the 14th which was called the day of preparation, because the lambs for the feast were slain in the afternoon of that day, preparatory to their being eaten before the morning of the 15th. Domestic preparation, involving the removal of all leaven from houses and the use of unleavened bread, began on the 13th; hence this was considered at this era "the first day of the Unleavened." <span class="cmt_word">Came to Jesus.</span> As the Master of the family, who had the ordering of all the details of the Paschal celebration. They did not know the mind of Jesus on the subject, and desired his directions as in former years. Bethany was considered as Jerusalem for the purposes of the solemn meal, and the apostles thought that preparation was to be made at some house in that village. <span class="cmt_word">Prepare for thee to eat the Passover</span>. The preparations were numerous: a proper room had to be found and swept and carefully cleansed from every particle of leaven; tables and couches had to be arranged, lights to be supplied, the lamb and all other necessaries (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> bread, wine, bitter herbs) provided. All these preparations took much time, so it was doubtless in the early morning that the disciples applied to our Lord. When they spoke of eating the Passover, they doubtless supposed that Christ meant in due course to celebrate the regular Paschal supper on the appointed day, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on the evening of Friday. But his intentions were different from what they expected. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-18.htm">Matthew 26:18</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The city.</span> Jerusalem. Jesus was at Bethany. St. Luke says that he sent Peter and John, now first joined together without James. To such a man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). The other synoptists mention certain signs by which they were to recognize the man. At the entrance of the city they would meet a man bearing a pitcher of water; they were to follow him to the house whither he went, and then give their message to the master of the house. There is a great similarity between this mission and that concerning the ass before the triumphal entry. The foreknowledge and the precision in directions are quite analogous. The "good man" was doubtless a disciple, though at this festival all strangers were freely received by any householder who had accommodation. Dr. Edersheim supposes that he was father of Mark, who was the "young man" arrested by the company that took Jesus (<a href="../../par/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a>). The secrecy observed in the above-mentioned arrangement was intended to keep the knowledge from Judas, and thus to secure immunity from interruption at the solemn meal. The traitor seems to have sneaked out from the last Supper, and disclosed Christ's retreat to the Jewish authorities, and conducted them to the house; but, finding that Jesus had left the room, he led them to Gethsemane, whither he knew that Jesus often resorted (<a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Master.</span> A disciple would know who was meant by this title (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>). Whether any previous arrangement had been made with him, we cannot tell; most probably Christ speaks from prevision and his providential ordering of events. <span class="cmt_word">My time is at hand.</span> The time of my suffering and death.

Of that Lamb the apostles did mystically eat when Christ gave them the bread and wine with the words, "This is my body;" "This is my blood." This Supper, which was virtually the new Passover, seems traditionally to have become confounded with the usual Paschal solemnity; hence the language of the synoptists assumes a form which is applicable to the regular Jewish feast. This explanation, if it seems to derogate somewhat from the precise verbal accuracy of the evangelists, would probably be confirmed if we were better acquainted with the customs then prevalent, and with the current meaning of the language employed. The ambiguity in the accounts may be divinely intended to call attention to the fact that the last Supper was not the Jewish Passover, but the Christian Passover - not the sacrifice on the cross, but an anticipation thereof. We may observe in passing that there is no mention of the lamb in the celebration; Peter and John were not enjoined to provide one, nor are they said to have visited the temple - which, indeed, on the 13th would have been useless: and yet to obtain the lamb in any other way would have been a breach of the Law, which we cannot suppose Christ would sanction. We may also notice that the word "feast" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>) is nowhere applied to the last Supper, though  it is always employed in reference to the Jewish solemnity. St. Paul, in his account of the institution of the Holy Communion (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11</a>.) makes no mention of any Paschal solemnities or associations, but merely states that it was appointed on the night in which Jesus was betrayed. <span class="cmt_word">With my disciples;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the twelve apostles; none but these, not even the master of the house, were present at this solemn scene.

They got the room ready, provided unfermented bread, wine, bitter herbs, sauce, and some dishes necessary for the feast. They would not eat the Paschal lamb at the legal time tomorrow, so the Lord ordained a commemorative and anticipatory solemnity, in which he appointed a rite which should take the place of the Jewish ceremony. We learn from the other synoptists that the householder was not satisfied with offering Christ and his friends the use of the common hall, which they would have had to share probably with other guests; but he assigned to them his best and most honourable chamber, "a large upper room," already properly arranged and furnished for the feast. Tradition has maintained that this apartment was that afterwards used by the apostles as a place of assembling, and where they received the effusion of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost.

The rule that obtained concerning the number in one company of partakers of the Paschal feast was that it never should be less than ten, nor more than the lamb would suffice to feed, though a morsel of the flesh was considered to satisfy all requirements. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-21.htm">Matthew 26:21</a></div><div class="verse">And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they did eat.</span> The details of the Paschal feast are expounded by rabbinical authors, though there is little in St. Matthew's account to lead us to conclude that our Lord observed them on this occasion. The ceremonial usually practised was as follows: The head of the family, sitting in the place of honour, took a cup of wine and water mixed ("the first cup"), pronounced a thanksgiving over it, and, having tasted it, passed it round to the guests; the master washed his hands, the others performing their ablutions at a later part of the service; the dishes were placed on the table; after a special benediction had been spoken over the bitter herbs, the master and the rest of the company took a bunch of these, dipped it in the appointed sauce, and ate it; an unleavened cake was broken and elevated with a prescribed formula; the second cup was filled, the history of the festival was proclaimed, <a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>, were recited, and the cup was drunk. Now began the proper Paschal meal with a general washing of hands; the lamb was cut into pieces, anda portion given to each, with a bit of the unleavened bread and bitter herbs dipped in the sauce, called by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>) "the sop." At the end of the meal, which was supplemented by other viands (which, however, were probably eaten before the lamb), the third cup, named by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>) "the cup of blessing," was drunk, and the solemn grace after meat was uttered. It would be necessary to examine St. John's Gospel to see how the ritual fitted into the actual details of the last Supper; we have to deal with St. Matthew's account. <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> Christ thus prepares the apostles for the incredible statement which he is about to make. <span class="cmt_word">One of you;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

He had before spoken vaguely of his betrayal (see <a href="../../par/matthew/17-22.htm">Matthew 17:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2</a>). By thus showing his knowledge of the coming treachery, and yet declining to denounce the traitor by name, he may have given Judas a last chance of repentance before the final act. St. Matthew omits the washing of the disciples' feet, and the strife about pre-eminence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-22.htm">Matthew 26:22</a></div><div class="verse">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Exceeding sorrowful.</span> Such an announcement filled them with amazement and grief; they scarcely dared suspect one another, but began to doubt their own constancy, though at the time conscious of their integrity. <span class="cmt_word">Is it I?</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">Numquid ego sum?

It is remarkable that the real character of Judas had never been discovered by the fellow disciples who for three years had mixed with him in closest companionship. Either he was a consummate hypocrite, or the other apostles were too simple-minded, good, and charitable to think evil of any one. Thus his peculations passed unnoticed, and the greed and. avarice which wrecked his spiritual life were entirely unsuspected. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a></div><div class="verse">And he answered and said, He that dippeth <i>his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that dippeth</span> (<span class="accented">dipped</span>) <span class="cmt_word">his hand with me in the dish.</span> Even now Jesus does not identify the traitor. Many had put their hands into the dish along with  Christ. Judas was one of those who had done so. The fact of eating together made in the Easterns' view, the treachery more monstrous. "Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me" (<a href="../../par/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). The dish was one of large dimensions, from which each guest took his portion with his fingers. It was truly a common meal in which all shared. Our Lord's words were spoken in answer to John's question, "Lord, who is it?" (John xii[. 25). The beloved apostle's position at table, "lying on Jesus' breast," enabled him to ask this without being overheard. There is a mistake commonly made concerning the shape of the table used on such occasions. It was not of a horseshoe form, but oblong. The couches were arranged round three of its sides, and it extended a little way beyond the divans. The Master's seat was not at the top or middle couch, but at the side; and from what occurred we should infer that John sat on the right of Jesus at the end of the couch, and Judas on the left of Jesus, the strife about precedency having been thus settled. (The correct shape of the table, and the places of Jesus, John, Judas, and Peter, are delineated in Edersheim's work, vol. 2. p. 494.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-24.htm">Matthew 26:24</a></div><div class="verse">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Son of man goeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">departeth</span>).

"The prescience of God," says Chrysostom, "is not the cause of men's wickedness, nor does it involve any necessity of it; Judas was not a traitor because God foresaw it, but he foresaw it because Judas would be so." <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto that man by</span> (<span class="accented">through</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>whom the Son of man is betrayed!</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b3;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x2e;</span> Judas could hear this and the following sentence, and yet retain his iniquitous purpose! <span class="cmt_word">It had been good for that man if he had not been born;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it were good for him if that man had not been born.</span> Jesus says this, knowing what the fate of Judas would be in the other world. There is no hope here held out of alleviation or end of suffering, or of ultimate restoration. It is a rayless darkness of despair. Had there been any expectation of relief or of recovery of God's favour, existence would be a blessing even to the worst of sinners; for they would have eternity still before them in which to enjoy their pardon and purification; and in such case it could not be said of them that it were better for them never to have been born. On one side of the mysterious problem connected with Judas and such-like sinners we may again quote St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 81, in Matthew'), "'What, then,' one may say, 'though Judas had not betrayed him, would not another have betrayed him?...  Because if Christ must needs be crucified, it must be by the means of some one, and if by some one, surely by such a person as this. But if all had been good, the dispensation in our behalf had been impeded.' Not so. For the All wise knows how he shall bring about our benefits, even had this happened. For his wisdom is rich in contrivance, and incomprehensible. So for this reason, that no one might suppose that Judas had become a minister of the dispensation, he declares the wretchedness of that man. But some one will say again, 'And if it had been good if he had never been born, wherefore did he suffer both this man and all the wicked to come into the world?' When thou oughtest to blame the wicked, for that, having the power not to become such as they are, they have become wicked, thou leavest this, and busiest thyself and art curious about the things of God, although knowing that it is not by necessity that any one is wicked."

If I do not expatiate upon the diverse opinions which have been held on this momentous subject, it is not because I have neglected to weigh and examine them, but because it is more conducive to edification to have a plain statement of what appears to the writer to be the truth, than to  confuse a reader with a multitude of interpretations which in the end have virtually to be surrendered. The points to be specially remembered before trying to expound the section are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He who institutes the ordinance is Almighty God made man, who is able to set aside one observance and to substitute another in its place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The new ordinance had an analogy with that which it superseded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> It was intended to be the one great service and means of grace for all Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The interpretation is to he connected with the great discourse of Jesus in the sixth chapter of St. John, where Christ speaks of himself as the Bread of life that came down from heaven, and his flesh and blood as the nourishment of his people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they were eating.</span> Before the supper was quite ended, and before the third cup of wine (see on ver. 21) was drunk. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus took bread</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the bread</span>, according to the Received Text). The special unleavened cake prepared for the Paschal meal. The four accounts agree in this detail, and seem to indicate a formal action or elevation, like the wave offering in the old Law. We see here the "High Priest after the order of Melchizedek" bringing forth bread and wine like his great prototype (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>), and by anticipation offering himself as victim. <span class="cmt_word">And blessed it.</span> The Received Text here and in St. Mark has <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which in some manuscripts has been altered to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, in conformity with the wording in St. Luke's and St. Paul's accounts. We find a similar interchange of the words in the miracles of the loaves (see <a href="../../par/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-6.htm">Mark 8:6</a>, etc.). Virtually, the two expressions are identical; the thanksgiving is a blessing, the blessing is a thanksgiving. The usual blessing uttered by the master over the unleavened cake is said to have been, "Blessed be he who giveth the bread of earth." From this benediction on the elements, and the thankful remembrance of Christ's death and the benefits thereof herein connoted, the Holy Communion has from the earliest times been called the Holy Eucharist. <span class="cmt_word">And brake it.</span> The fraction of the bread was so important and essential a part of the institution, that it gave its name to the whole rite, and "breaking of bread" represented the cele bration of the Holy Eucharist, the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>, etc.). Under the old Law the fraction represented the sufferings endured by the chosen people; in Christ's new institution it symbolized his death, when his feet and hands were pierced with the nails and his side with the spear. <span class="cmt_word">Gave it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <span class="accented">was giving</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to the disciples.</span> He gave to each of them a portion of the cake in their hand. If they had risen from their couches at the solemn benediction, as we may well suppose they did, they were still standing when the Lord distributed the consecrated bread. That they received it reclining in an easy posture seems unlikely. <span class="cmt_word">Take</span> (<span class="accented">ye</span>), <span class="cmt_word">eat</span> (ye). The two words are given only in our Gospel; St. Mark has "take ye" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> being there an interpolation). St. Luke and St. Paul omit them altogether. We should infer that Christ did not himself partake of the bread or wine (which would have confused the deep significance of the ordinance), but gave it to his apostles, that by such participation they might be identified with the sacrifice represented by the broken bread, thus transforming the Levitical rite into a new sacrament which did not merely commemorate his death, but conveyed its benefits to faithful receivers. <span class="cmt_word">This is my body.</span> "This" in the Greek is neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), and therefore is not in agreement with "bread" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), which is masculine. It is to be explained as "This which I give you, this which ye receive." The copula "is" would not be expressed in the Aramaic, which Christ spoke; and yet what a world of controversy has hung on this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>! Some take it as absolutely identifying subject and predicate; others regard it as equivalent to "represents;" others, again, would modify it in some manner, so that it should not logically express the agreement of the two terms of the proposition. It was doubtless a startling statement to those who then heard it for the first time, but it came upon them not wholly unprepared. In his momentous discourse on the Bread of life, after the feeding of the five thousand, Jesus had spoken of himself as the Food of his people, and then proceeded to make the amazing assertion, "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you" (<a href="../../par/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53</a>). The meaning of this mysterious warning was not further explained. Now as the Lord distributed to the apostles the blessed morsels with those solemn words, they learned what he meant by eating his flesh and drinking his blood, how he put it in his servants' power to fulfil the injunction. In what sense could "this" be his body? He was there before their eyes in human form, perfect Man; and yet he gives something else, not that which was standing before them, as his body. Stupendous mystery, past finding out! There is no room here for metaphor or figure. He is not figuratively describing himself or his office or his work, as when he calls himself the good Shepherd, the Door, the Vine, the  Way: he directs attention to one part of his nature, his body, and that as toed to be eaten. He shows the mode by which we may be participators of this his lower nature, that as, joined to Adam, we die, so thus united to Christ, we live. We must, as before observed, remember that he who said these words was God incarnate, and that he designed to give his Church a means of realizing and receiving those stupendous blessings set forth in his Eucharistic discourse as depending upon due reception of his body and blood. It is obvious that the apostles could not understand the terms literally, but, believing in his Godhead, believing that he could bring to pass that which he said, they apprehended them in a supernatural, mystical sense; they had faith to know that in these holy elements, blessed by their Lord, they received him, ate his flesh and blood, to their soul's health. This was no mere commemorative rite, not simply a way of remembering Christ's death and Passion, but it was a sacrament, an outward sign of an inward reality, something from without entering the recipients and imparting to them that which before they had not. How the outward and inward are joined together we cannot tell. It is, and will always remain, an unfathomable mystery. The presence of Christ's humanity in the Holy Communion is beyond, above, the ordinary conditions of man's nature; it is supernatural, miraculous, even as was his incarnation, which joined manhood and Deity. The substance, indeed, of the elements remains as before, their nature is not changed, but they have a new relation and use and office; they serve as a means of communicating Christ's body and blood, and they are so called before reception, so that the receiver's faith does not make them to. be such, but Christ's own word with power. Attempts to explain this Divine matter hopelessly fail. Hence the Romanist with his transubstantiation, or change of substance; the Lutheran with his consubstantiation, or confusion of substance; the Zuinglian with his irreverent virtualism, alike fall into error and depart from pure doctrine. The only right attitude is to leave all such efforts alone, to believe Christ's word simply but wholly, and to use the sacrament in full faith, that by and through it to the faithful recipient are imparted incalculable benefits. To the words, "<span class="accented">This</span> is <span class="accented">my body</span>," St. Luke adds, "which is being given (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) for you;" and St. Paul, "which is [broken;? genuine] for you." Thus the Lord, before he actually suffered, offered himself as a Victim voluntarily undergoing death, and showed it forth by the broken bread and the poured wine. We are told that the master of the household, when he distributed the pieces of the lamb, said solemnly, "This is the body of the Paschal lamb." Christ transformed this formula to a new use, but in neither case did it introduce a mere symbol of something absent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a></div><div class="verse">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i>it</i> to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He took the cup</span>. Many good manuscripts have "a cup," and some modern editors omit the article; but this cup was the only one on the table at the time; so the reading matters not. This was probably the third cup at the close of the Paschal meal (see on ver. 21). The wine of the country is what we call a red wine (compare "the blood of grapes," <a href="../../par/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>); it was mixed with a little water when used at the table. This third cup was termed "the cup of blessing" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>), because over it was spoken a special benediction, and it was regarded as the principal cup, following, as it did, the eating of the lamb. <span class="cmt_word">Gave thanks</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The thanksgiving was a blessing (see on ver. 26). The celebration of Christ's death and the remembrance of the incalculable blessings obtained thereby may well be termed the Holy Eucharist, the great sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) it <span class="cmt_word">to them.</span> The aorist here used would imply strictly that he gave the cup once for all, herein differentiating the action from that employed in distributing the bread. St. Luke's expression, "Take this, and divide it among yourselves," refers to an earlier stage of the supper. In the present connection he nearly agrees with the other synoptists. It is possible that the cup was passed from hand to hand after it had been blessed by Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Drink ye all of it.</span> St Mark adds, "And they all drank of it." Strange it is that, with these words written in the Scripture, any Church should have the hardihood to deny the cup to any qualified Christian. The Romanist's assertion that the cup is for priests alone, as it was given to the apostles only, and was destined for them and their sacerdotal successors, would apply equally to the consecrated bread, and then what becomes of the <span class="accented">general</span> use of the ordinance? If we would have life in us, we must not only eat Christ's flesh, but drink his blood. We need to be refreshed as well as strengthened in the battle of life, and it may well be that the mutilation of the sacrament carries with it spiritual effects that impede the soul's health.

The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">novi testamenti.</span> The old covenant between God and his people had been ratified at Sinai by the blood of many victims (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8-13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>, etc.); the blood of Christ shed upon the cross ratifies "the new or Christian covenant to the world and the Church, and the same blood sacramentally applied ratifies the covenant individually to each Christian" (Sadler). The evangelical covenant supersedes the Judaic, even as the sacrifice of Christ fulfils and supersedes the Levitical sacrifices. <span class="cmt_word">Which is shed</span> (<span class="accented">is being shed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for many</span>. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">effundetur</span>, in reference to the crucifixion of the morrow; but this is tampering with the text. Rather, by using the present tense, the Lord signifies that his death is certain - that the sacrifice has already begun, that the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>) was now offering the eternal sacrifice. The whole ordinance is significant of the completion of the atonement. "Many" here is equivalent to "all." Redemption is universal, though all men do not accept the offer (see on ch. 20:28). Even Calvin says, "Non partem mundi tantum designat, sed totum humanum genus." <span class="cmt_word">For the remission of sins.</span> "For without shedding of blood is no remission" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>); "The blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>). The sacrifices of the Law, the blood of bulls and goats, could not take away sin; at most they gave a ritual and ceremonial purification. But what the Mosaic Law could not effect was accomplished by the precious blood of Christ, who offered himself a spotless and perfect Victim unto God. This is our Lord's most complete announcement of the propitiatory nature of his sacrifice, which is appropriated by faith in the reception of his precious blood. St. Paul adds, "This do ye (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me [<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, 'for my commemoration']." These were, of course, Christ's words spoken at the time, and are of most important bearing on what is called the sacrificial aspect of the Holy Eucharist.

From this moment forward he tastes not the cup. It does not follow that he had partaken of the consecrated wine which he gave his apostles. Probability is against his having done so (see on ver. 26). He used the same words with the first cup at the commencement of the supper (<a href="../../par/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>). Of this he probably partook, but not of the latter. The offspring of the vine is a poetical way of describing wine (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>, etc.). It is absurd to find in this term an argument for unalcoholic grape juice. Wine, to be wine, must undergo fermentation, and if it is not to putrefy or to become vinegar, it must develop alcohol. <span class="cmt_word">When I drink it new</span> (<span class="greek_word">kaino/n</span>) <span class="cmt_word">with you in my</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father's kingdom.</span> This mysterious announcement has been variously interpreted, and its meaning must remain uncertain. Some refer it to Christ's intercourse with his disciples after he rose from the dead, when <span class="accented">e.g.</span> he partook of food with them (<a href="../../par/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30, 42, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>). But this seems hardly to meet the requirements of the text, though it has the support of Chrysostom, who writes, "Because he had discoursed with them concerning Passion and cross, he again introduces what he has to say of his resurrection, having made mention of a kingdom before them, and by this term calling his own resurrection. And wherefore did be drink after he was risen again? Lest the grosser sort might suppose that the resurrection was a phantasy To show, therefore, that they should see him manifestly risen again, and that he should be with them once more, and that they themselves shall be witness to the things that are done, both by sight and by act, he saith, 'until I drink it new with you,' you bearing witness. But what is 'new'? In a new, that is, in a strange manner, not having a passible body, but now immortal and incorruptible, and not needing food." Some explain it of the Passover, of which he then partook for the last time, the type being fulfilled in him. The solution does not explain the new participation in the kingdom of God. It seems, on the whole, best to understand it as a prophecy of the great marriage supper of the Lamb, and the joys that await the faithful in the new heavens and the new earth. The wine is (he token of the felicities of this dispensation, and it is called "new" in contrast with the obsolete character of that which it superseded. "Novitatem dicit plane eingularem" (Bengel).

There is an emphasis on "all ye;" even ye eleven, who have been steadfast hitherto.

Commenting on his offence, St. Chrysostom says, "The matters of blame were two: both that he gainsaid Christ, and that he set himself before others; or, rather, a third, too, namely, that he attributed all to himself." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Peter's boast elicits a crushing reply from his Lord, foretelling the special sin of which he would be guilty, and the very time of the night when it should be committed. <span class="cmt_word">This night, before the cock crow.</span> The word "cock" is without the article, so the meaning may be "before a cock crow;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably before midnight. Cocks were unclean birds, and not kept by strict Jews, and their voice was not much heard in Jerusalem; though it is quite different now, where barn door fowls swarm round every house. One of the night watches, that about 3 a.m., was known as "cock-crow" (see <a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>). Some think this is what is meant here. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> What Peter denied was that he knew anything of Christ, or had ever been his follower (see vers. 69-75; <a href="../../par/luke/22-34.htm">Luke 22:34</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-35.htm">Matthew 26:35</a></div><div class="verse">Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.

Christ's explanation of his meaning only drew from Peter a more energetic asseveration of his constancy even unto death. "He thought he was able," says St. Augustine, "because he felt that he wished." The other apostles made a similar assertion, and Jesus said no more, leaving time to prove the truth of his sad foreboding. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a></div><div class="verse">Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-46.</span> - <span class="accented">The agedly of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32-42</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39-46</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - Gethsemane (equivalent to "oil  press"). Jesus retired thither for privacy and for prayer in anticipation of what was coming. St. John explains, "Where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples." This so called garden was situated a short distance from the bridge over the Kedron, at the foot of the Mount of Olives. It was a plantation of olives; and there are many of these trees, some of great age, still growing in the neighbourhood. The fanciful idea that some of these witnessed the agony of our Lord has no support whatever. In the first place, olive trees do not live two thousand years; and, secondly, it is certain that in the sieges of Jerusalem all surrounding trees were ruthlessly destroyed; and lastly, the exact site of this terrible scene is unknown, though tradition has fixed upon a certain spot now enclosed with walls, and containing a building known by the name of "The Chapel of the Sweat." <span class="cmt_word">The disciples.</span> Eight of them - Judas having long ago departed - and three Jesus took with him deeper into the dim recesses of the wood. <span class="cmt_word">Sit ye here.</span> Remain here, at the entrance to the olive yard. These might not behold even the beginning of his desolation. Their present faith and love were not equal to the strain. <span class="cmt_word">Go and pray yonder.</span> One is reminded of Abraham at Mount Moriah, when he says to the attendants, "Abide ye here, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>). When the Lord says "here" and "yonder," he points to the spots indicated. He always retired to pray, even as he tells his followers to enter into their closets when they put up their supplications to their Father in heaven. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-37.htm">Matthew 26:37</a></div><div class="verse">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Peter and the two sons of Zebedee.</span> These three had been privileged to behold his transfiguration, and that glimpse of his glory strengthened them to bear the partial sight of their dear Lord's sufferings. Did his human heart crave for sympathy, and did he desire not to be utterly alone at this awful crisis? We may well suppose so, as he was true Man, with all man's feelings and sensibilities. <span class="cmt_word">Began to be sorrowful and very heavy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to be sore dismayed</span>). This word seems to be used of the dismay that comes with an unexpected calamity. St. Mark tells us that Christ was "sore amazed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). It is as though the prospect of what was coming suddenly opened to his vision and overwhelmed him. He now set before himself, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his human consciousness, the sufferings which he had to undergo, with all that led to them, and all that would follow, and the burden was crushing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a></div><div class="verse">Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death</span> (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a>). Christ speaks here of the mental agony which he is enduring; he bides not from the faithful three that which weighs upon his heart, so excessive a strain that human nature must fail to endure it. We cannot gauge the anguish; we may suggest some of the causes of this sorrow. It was not merely the thought of bodily pain, though that would be long and excessive; there were other elements which made his sorrow like to no other sorrow. He thought of all the circumstances that led to his Passion; all that would accompany it; all that would succeed it - the malice and perversity of the Jews, the grievous wickedness that brought about his death, the treachery of Judas, the desertion of his friends, the denial of Peter, his unjust condemnation at the hands of the rulers of the chosen nation, the pusillanimity of Pilate, the guilt of the actors in the tragedy, the wilful iniquity of those whom he came to redeem, the ruin which they brought on themselves, their city and nation - such considerations formed one ingredient in the bitter cup which he had to drain. And then the thought of death was unspeakably terrible to the all-holy Son of God. We men become accustomed to the thought of death. It accompanies us through all our life; it looms before us always. But man was created immortal (Wisd. 2:23), his nature shrinks from the dissolution of soul and body; and to the sinless, unfallen Man this experience was wholly unknown and awful. Here was the incarnate God, the God-Man, submitting himself to the punishment of sin, tasting death forevery man, bearing in his own Person the inexpressible bitterness of this penal humiliation. Added to all this was the incalculable fact that "the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all." The burden of the sins of all mankind he bore on his sacred shoulders. "Him who knew no sin God made to be sin on our behalf" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). What this mysterious imputation, so to speak, involved, we cannot tell; but to a being perfectly pure and holy it must have been anguish unspeakable. <span class="cmt_word">Tarry ye here.</span> As ver. 36, "Sit ye here." <span class="cmt_word">And watch with me.</span> In his dark hour his human soul yearned for the comfort of a friendly presence; even though these chosen three might not witness the extremity of his agony, their proximity and sympathy and prayers were a support. But he bade them watch for their own sake also. Their great trial was close at hand; they were about to be tempted to deny and forsake him; they could resist only by prayer and watchfulness (ver. 41). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a></div><div class="verse">And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i>wilt</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went a little further.</span> Deeper into the wood, beneath the gloomy shadow of the olive trees, yet so as not to feel  absolutely alone. St. Luke names the distance, "He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast." By some clerical error the genuine reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "having gone forward," has been altered in most of the best manuscripts into <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "having approached." There can be no doubt that this latter reading is erroneous; and it is well, as occasion bids, to call attention to possible mistakes in the most important uncials. <span class="cmt_word">Fell on his face, and prayed.</span> He prostrated himself on the ground in utter abasement and desolation, yet in submission withal. In this terrible crisis there is no resource but prayer. The shadow of death enveloped him, wave and storm rolled over his soul; yet out of the deep he called unto the Lord. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7, 8</a>) some affecting details are added, "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered." <span class="cmt_word">O my Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The personal pronoun is omitted in some manuscripts, but it has high authority. Only on this occasion and in his great prayer (<a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) does Christ so address the Father, his human nature in the depth of suffering retaining still the sense of this paternity. St. Mark has, "Abba, Father," as if he spake for the Hebrew race and the Gentile world. <span class="cmt_word">If it be possible;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if there is any other way in which man may be saved and thou be glorified; if there is any other mode of redemption. It is the cry of humanity, yet conditioned by perfect submission. <span class="cmt_word">Let this cup pass from me.</span> The "cup" is the bitter agony of his Passion and death, with all their grievous accompaniments (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>, and note there). All heroism and manly endurance in the face of pain and death Christ exhibited to the full; but the elements of suffering in his case were different, and fraught with exquisite torture (see above, on ver. 28). Such was the anguish that it would have then separated soul and body - of such rigour that "his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground" - had not an angel appeared from heaven to strengthen and support the fainting human life (<a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> In this prayer are shown the two wills of Christ, the human and Divine. The natural shrinking of the human soul from ignominy and torture is overborne by entire submission to and compliance with the Divine purpose. So it is said that the Captain of our salvation was made perfect through sufferings, learned obedience by the things which he suffered (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>) By this passage the Monophysite and Monothelite heresies are clearly refuted, the two natures and two wills of Christ being plainly displayed. The three apostles saw only some part of their Master's intense agony, and heard only some broken utterances of his supplication; hence there are some slight variations in the synoptical accounts. St. Mark doubtless derived his account immediately from St Peter; the other synoptists from some other source. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40</a></div><div class="verse">And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh unto the disciples</span>. He rose from prayer and returned to his three apostles, seeking their sympathy and the comfort of their presence in his lonely desolation. <span class="cmt_word">Findeth them asleep;</span> <span class="accented">sleeping.</span> The comfort which his man's nature craved was denied him. St. Luke, the physician, says that the disciples were "sleeping for sorrow." Some great mental shock, some poignant distress, often produces a bodily stupor and sleep; but this is scarcely a valid excuse for such insensibility at this terrible crisis, especially as the Lord had urged them to watch (ver. 38). They had had a very trying day; Peter and John had undergone much bodily fatigue in preparing the last Supper; they were all weary, full of grief, and weighed down by foreboding; it was no wonder that they succumbed to these influences, though we might have expected that such as they would have risen superior to them. "The simple law, that extraordinary tension raises the highly developed spiritual life, while it stupefies the less developed, finds here its strongest illustration in the almost absolute contrast of spiritual watchfulness and sleep" (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">Saith unto Peter.</span> Peter had been most forward in profession (vers. 33, 35); so Christ addresses him first. The other two, James and John, bad boldly asserted that they were able to drink of Christ's cup of suffering (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>); so they are included in the tender reproach. <span class="cmt_word">What</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>could ye not watch with me?</span> <span class="accented">So, could ye not</span>, etc.? Is it so that? Are ye unable to do even this little thing for me? Truly a pathetic reproof! <span class="cmt_word">One hour</span>. It may be that this first stage of the agony had lasted for an hour, but the term is more probably indefinite; or it may refer to the whole time of trial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a></div><div class="verse">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i>is</i> willing, but the flesh <i>is</i> weak.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Watch</span> (<span class="accented">ye</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and</span> pray. A summary of Christian duty. Watchfulness <span class="accented">sees</span> temptation coming; prayer gives strength to withstand it. The apostles needed the injunction at this moment; for their great trial was close at hand. <span class="cmt_word">That ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">enter not</span> (<span class="accented">in order that ye may not eater</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into temptation.</span> The phrase is usually interpreted to mean either to fall into temptation, to be tempted, or to run wilfully into temptation; but it seems to be better, with Grotius, to  take it in the sense of succumbing to, falling under, being vanquished by temptation, like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>, "immergi et succumbere." That Peter and the rest were now to be tempted was certain (<a href="../../par/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31, 32</a>), and it was too late to deprecate the trial; but it was right and expedient to ask of God grace to withstand in the evil hour. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> This was an added motive for vigilance and prayer. The apostles had shown a certain readiness of spirit when they offered to die with Christ (ver. 35); but the flesh, the material and lower nature, represses the higher impulse, checks the will, and prevents it from carrying out that which it is prompted to perform (see the action of these contrariant forces noticed by St. Paul, <a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>.). "For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things" (Wisd. 9:15). Our Lord at this very time was experiencing and exemplifying the truth of his saying, though in his ease the weakness of the flesh was entirely overmastered by the willing spirit. It is noted that Polycarp quotes this maxim of Christ in his 'Epistle to the Philippians,' ch. 7. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-42.htm">Matthew 26:42</a></div><div class="verse">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again the second time.</span> A pleonastic expression, as in <a href="../../par/john/4-54.htm">John 4:54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a>, etc., calling especial attention to "the numerical re-repetition of the Saviour's prayer" (Morison). St. Matthew alone gives the words of this second prayer, which differs in some respects from the first. The possibility of the cup passing away was considered no longer; the continuance of the trial showed that it was not to he. <span class="cmt_word">If this cup may</span> (<span class="accented">can</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>not pass away from me...  thy will be done.</span> He accepts the cup; his human will coincides with the Divine will; he acquiesces with perfect self-resignation. The cup, relatively to the circumstances, could not pass away from the Saviour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-43.htm">Matthew 26:43</a></div><div class="verse">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He came and found them asleep (</span><span class="accented">sleeping</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>again</span>.

Weighed down with drowsiness; St. Mark adds, "Neither wist they what to answer him."

Three times he prayed, and his prayer was always of the same import - teaching us by example to be urgent, instant, in supplication, and, though the special request be denied, to be sure that we are heard and that an answer will be given; even as Christ obtained not the withdrawal of the cup, but strength to submit, endure, and conquer. We must compare this threefold prayer and contest with the threefold temptation at the beginning of our Lord's ministry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a></div><div class="verse">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take <i>your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cometh he.</span> St. Hilary comments on these three visits: "On his first return he reproves, on the second he holds his peace, on the third he bids to rest." The contest was over; the human will was now entirely one with the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Sleep on now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">henceforward</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and take your rest.</span> This is probably to be understood literally. There was a short interval still before the apprehension and the subsequent events; as they could not watch, they might use this in finishing their sleep, and recruiting their wearied bodies in preparation for the coming trial. Many expositors find an irony in Christ's words, taken in connection with those that follow, as if he meant, "In a few minutes I shall be seized; sleep on if you can; you will soon be miserably awakened, make the most of the present." But at this moment the tender Jesus would surely never have condescended to address his friends in such a style. All his words and actions were animated with the deepest love for them and anxiety on their account. A change to irony is really inconceivable under the circumstances. Nor is there any reason to take the sentence interrogatively, "Sleep ye at such a moment?" It is more simple to regard the words as said <span class="accented">bona fide</span>, with no mental reservation and no implied censure. We may suppose that a pause ensued before the utterance of the next clause, and that the Lord allowed his fatigued followers to sleep on till the last moment. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the hour is at hand, and</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">when</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Son of man is betrayed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">is being betrayed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into the hands of sinners.</span> He calls all simmers who take part in his apprehension, trial, and death - not the Romans only (as <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), but priests, eiders, multitude, who joined in the crowd and incurred the guilt. There is now no sign of wavering; he is ready, yea, eager to meet the sufferings which he foresees.

Judas was more than usually demonstrative in his salutation. "The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords" (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). So Joab treated Amasa before he murdered him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9, 10</a>). What infinite patience for the Lord to submit to this hypocritical caress! It is a type of the wonderful goodness and long suffering of God towards sinners, how he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come?

The word seems, in the New Testament, to be always addressed to the evil, though in itself an expression of affection. Here Christ uses no reproach; to the last he endeavours by kindness andlove to win the traitor to a better mind. St. Luke narrates that Jesus called him by name, saying, "Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?" <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Wherefore art thou come?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. The Received Text gives <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, which has very inferior authority. There is great difficulty in giving an exact interpretation of this clause. The Authorized Version, as the Vulgate (<span class="accented">Ad quid venisti?</span>), takes it interrogatively; but such a use of the relative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span> is unknown. If it is interrogative, we must understand, "Is it this for which thou art come?" But Christ knew too well the purport of Judas's arrival to put such an unnecessary question. Others explain, "Do that, or, I know that for which thou art come." Alford, Farrar, and others consider the sentence as unfinished, the concluding member being suppressed by an aposiopesis consequent on the agitation of the Speaker, "That errand on which thou hast come - <span class="accented">complete."</span> More probably the clause is an exclamation, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> being equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as in later Greek, "For what a purpose art thou here!" It is, indeed, a last remonstrance and appeal to the conscience of the traitor. <span class="cmt_word">Took him.</span> They seized him with their hands, but did not bind him till afterwards (<a href="../../par/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>). Whether Judas had any latent hope or expectation that Jesus at this supreme moment would assert and justify his Messiahship, we know not. The histories give no hint of any such idea, and it is most improbable that the apostate was thus influenced (see on ver. 14). We must here introduce the incident recorded by St. John (John 18:4-9). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i>his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of them which were with Jesus.</span> St. John names Peter as the agent in the attack on the high priest's servant; he also alone gives the name of the servant, Malchus. Of the circumstances which led to the subsequent miracle all the evangelists give an account; the miracle itself is related only by St. Luke. Conjecture has attempted to give reasons for these deficiencies in some of the narratives, and the complementary details in others; but it is wisest to say that thus it has seemed good to the Holy Ghost who guided the writers, and there to leave the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Drew his sword.</span> The apostles had evidently misunderstood the Lord's words uttered a little while before (<a href="../../par/luke/22-36.htm">Luke 22:36-38</a>), "He that hath no sword, let him sell his cloke, and  buy one." Two of them had then exhibited the weapons with which they had armed themselves, as if ready to repel violence And now one of these, thinking that the hour was arrived for striking a blow in his Master's defence, resorted to violence. Physical courage, indeed, Peter possessed, as was proved by his attitude in the face of fearful odds, but of moral courage he and his comrades exhibited little evidence, when, as soon as their Master was apprehended and led away, they "all forsook him, and fled" (ver. 56). <span class="cmt_word">Struck a</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>servant of the high</span> <span class="cmt_word">priest's.</span> The man was the high priest's servant in a special way - what we should call his bodyservant; he had evidently made himself conspicuous in the arrest, and Peter struck fiercely at his head as the foremost of the aggressors. St. John, who was acquainted with the high priest and his household, gives his name as Malchus, a Syriac word, meaning "Counsellor." <span class="cmt_word">Smote off his ear.</span> The blow fell short, but inflicted a serious wound. How the mischief was repaired by the healing touch of Christ is mentioned alone by Luke the physician, for whom the incident would have special interest. We may note, in passing, that this miracle (the last which Christ worked before his death) was wholly unsolicited and unexpected on the part of the recipient, and was performed upon an enemy actually engaged in hostility. What more striking proof of the Lord's mercy and forgiveness could have been given? What better way could there be of demonstrating the nature of the kingdom which he came to establish? Thus he displayed his superhuman power even while surrendering himself to captivity and death. By this immediate action too he secured his followers from reprisal, so that they were allowed to retire unmolested, and Peter, though recognized to have been one of those in the garden (<a href="../../par/john/18-26.htm">John 18:26</a>), was not punished for his part in the transaction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put up again thy sword into his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>place.</span> Christ orders Peter to sheathe his sword; but the wording is peculiar, <span class="accented">Turn away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">thy sword</span>; as if Christ would say, "The sword is none of mine; the arm of flesh and the carnal weapon are thine; turn off thy sword from the use which thou art making of it to its proper destination, to be wielded only at God's command." Then he gives a motive for this injunction. <span class="cmt_word">For all they that take</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> There is a stress on the word "take," and there is an imperative force in the future, "shall perish." The Lord is speaking of those who arbitrarily and presumptuously resort to violence; and he says, "Let them feel the sword." The word was of wide application, and contained a universal truth; it was, in fact, a re-enactment of the primaeval law touching the sacredness of human life, and the penalty that ensues on its infringement (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5, 6</a>). It enforced also the general lesson that violence and revenge effect no good end, and bring their own punishment. There is no prophecy here (as some suppose) of the destruction of the Jews at the hands of the Romans; nor is Christ intent on soothing Peter by the thought of the future retribution which awaited the enemies whom he was so eager to chastise. Such suggestions are arbitrary and unwarranted by the context. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a></div><div class="verse">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thinkest thou that I cannot now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">pray to</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">beseech</span>) <span class="cmt_word">my Father?</span> Jesus proceeds to show that he needs not Peter's puny assistance. <span class="greek">&#x397;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">An putas? Or thinkest thou?</span> The particle, neglected by the Authorized Version, marks the transition to a new motive. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> has the special meaning of "to summon with authority," "to call upon as an ally." Peter needed still to learn the lesson of Christ's Divinity, his oneness with the Father; and this is furnished by the right interpretation of this word, which was not, as our version seems to make it, the cry of an inferior to one mightier than himself, but the summons of an equal to his great Ally in heaven. So Jesus virtually says, "Have I not power through my own Godhead to summon my Father to support me?" (Sewell, 'Microscope of the New Testament'). <span class="cmt_word">Shall presently give me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The Authorized Version seems to have read <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> twice, "now...  presently." The manuscripts show it only once, but vary its position. It most probably belongs to the first clause. The verb rendered "give" has a more pregnant meaning. It is a military term meaning "to place by the side," "to post on one's flank." Hence the Lord implies that at a word the serried ranks of angels would range themselves at his side, true flank comrades, to defend and support him. <span class="cmt_word">Twelve legions of angels.</span> Not a dozen weak men. He employs the Roman term "legion" with intention. He had been arrested by a cohort (<a href="../../par/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3, 12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the tenth part of the legion, which numbered six thousand men; he could, it he chose, call to his aid twelve times six thousand angels, who would deliver their Lord from his enemies. If there was to be an appeal to force, which Peter's rash assault suggested, what could withstand his angelic allies, the heavenly hosts, infinitely more numerous, better disciplined, more effectively officered, prompt and happy to do the will of the great Commander?

In what way, Christ asks, shall God's determined counsel be accomplished, if you turn to the arm of the flesh, or if I use my Divine power to save myself? The will of God, as declared in Scripture, was that Jesus should be betrayed, seized, should suffer and die. Christ's will was one with the Father's and one with the Spirit's who inspired the Scripture, and therefore he must pass through each stage, undergo each detail, which the sacred volume specified. It was not merely that events were so arranged that they thus befell; nor merely that prophets of old foretold them; but there was some special moral duty and obligation in fulfilling them, which Christ, as one with the Father and the Holy Ghost, was minded to carry out in all perfection. Here was a ray of comfort for Peter and the other apostles. All was foreordained; its announcement in God's book proved it came from God, was under his control and ordering. Patience, therefore, and silent acquiescence were the duties now incumbent. "Be still, then, and know that I am God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-55.htm">Matthew 26:55</a></div><div class="verse">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?

He submitted to indignities, but he felt them deeply; he allowed himself to be treated as a malefactor, but was not insensible to the shame of being supposed to have been capable of acting as such. <span class="cmt_word">A thief</span>; <span class="accented">a robber.</span> One at the head of a band of lawless ruffians, who would resist you with arms in their hands - a <span class="accented">sicarius</span>, a cutthroat, who lurked in secret places to murder the innocent. <span class="cmt_word">I sat daily with you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, probably an interpolation from Mark). All the past week, at any rate, Christ had taught quietly and openly in the temple. He had none of the habits of the robber; he had not courted secrecy; he had no company of armed men to defend him; why did they not arrest him then? According to St. Luke, Christ adds, "But this is your hour, and the power of darkness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a></div><div class="verse">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.

He repeats to the multitude what he had said to Peter (ver. 54, where see note), and what he had already intimated at the last Supper (vers. 24, 31). To quote the words of Stier, "Again and again he de. clares that one thing which, nevertheless, Christian theology perpetually refuses to learn from the supreme Teacher and Doctor. He holds firmly to the Scripture, whether speaking to the exasperated Jews or the docile disciples; he puts those to shame in their folly by proofs from Scripture, and strengthens these in their despondency by its consolatory promises. He appeals to Scripture in his vehement disputation with men, as he does in his solemn way of suffering to die for them; he confronts Satan with 'It is written,' and prays to the Father - that the Scripture may be fulfilled." If Christ had been taken prematurely in the temple, and put to death by a tumultuary stoning, prophecy would not have been fulfilled, and his death would not have been the appointed sacrifice of the Lamb of God. <span class="cmt_word">Forsook him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and fled.</span> As he had foretold (ver. 31). They saw their Master bound and helpless; they recognized that he would not deliver himself by heavenly aid, and, fearing to share his fate, they looked to their own safety and basely abandoned him in his hour of danger. Now occurred the incident mentioned only by St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a>), which is explained rightly by Edersheim (2:485, 544). Only Peter and John followed the officers to the high priest's palace.

His palace was nearest to the place of capture, and the soldiers appear to have received orders to conduct the Prisoner thither, Annas having vast influence with the Romans, and being the principal mover in the matter. What passed before him is not recorded, none of the disciples being present at the examination. The synoptists take up the account when Jesus was sent bound to Caiaphas, who St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-14.htm">John 18:14</a>) notes was the one who for political reasons had urged the judicial murder of Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">Where</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in whose house) <span class="cmt_word">the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> This seems to have been an informal meeting of the leading Sanhedrists, hastily convened, not in their usual place of meeting, but in a chamber of Caiaphas's palace. Some years before this time the right of pronouncing capital sentences had been removed from the council; and hence the necessity of assembling in the hall Gazith (where only such sentences could be delivered) existed no longer.

They were glad to fall back upon something else, which especially concerned Annas and Caiaphas, and their gainful trading in the sacred courts (see the next note).

At the time the Jews had not understood the words, and they now pervert them into a criminal accusation, which might take the form of charging him with being either an impious fomenter of disturbance, or a pretender to superhuman powers, Divine or Satanic. In either case, the charge would bring him into collision with the Roman authorities, which was the real object of this preliminary inquiry. We must not forget that Christ had twice interfered with the traffic in the temple, which was carried on to the great profit of the avaricious family of Annas, and that the malice of the high priests was on this account greatly embittered.

And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 63.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus hold his peace;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">continued silent</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/27-12.htm">Matthew 27:12-14</a>).

He knew it was of no use, and was not the moment, to explain the mystery of the words which he had used. Indeed, it was unfair to ask him to explain the discrepancies in the alleged testimony. "Attempts at defence were unprofitable, no man hearing. For this was a show only of a court of justice, but in truth an onset of robbers, assailing him without cause, as in a cave or on the road" (St. Chysostom, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The case was best met by a majestic silence. <span class="cmt_word">Answered</span>. Puzzled and embarrassed by Christ's persistent silence, Caiaphas at last proceeds to put to him a question which he must answer, and which must lead to some definite result. <span class="cmt_word">I adjure thee by the living God.</span> The high priest now addresses Jesus officially as the minister of Jehovah, and puts him under an oath to make an answer. To such an adjuration a reply was absolutely necessary, and the Law held a man guilty who kept silence under such circumstances (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Christ, the Son of God.</span> It is not to be supposed that Caiaphas by these words intended to imply that Messiah was one with God, of one nature, power, and eternity. It is not likely that he had risen above the popular Jewish conception of Messiah, which was of one inferior to God, though invested with certain Divine attributes. But he had heard that Jesus had more than once claimed God as his Father, so he now, as he hopes, will force a confession from the Prisoner's lips, which will set the question at rest one way or the other, and give him ground for decisive action, and enable him to denounce Christ either as an acknowledged impostor or a blasphemer. His language is, perhaps, based on the second psalm, vers. 2, 6, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a></div><div class="verse">Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 64.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast said;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 25); in St. Mark, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. This is a strong affirmative asseveration, and on Christ's lips carries with it the full meaning of the words used by Caiaphas, "I am the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One, God of God, of one substance with the Father." <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in spite of your incredulity.

Right hand of power. Of Omnipotence, of Almighty God. <span class="cmt_word">Coming in the clouds of heaven</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>). Christ thus distinctly asserts his Divinity, and claims to apply to himself the utterance in <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, and the great prophecy of Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>). This was the plainest and most specific declaration of his real nature, power, and attributes, made with calm majesty, though he knew it was to seal his condemnation, and open the immediate way to his death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a></div><div class="verse">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The high priest rent his clothes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). His outer garments, not his pontifical vestment, which he would not wear on this occasion. St. Mark notes that he rent his under clothes, his tunic; so probably he tore both outer and inner garments. This was done in assumed horror at Christ's blasphemy (cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>), rabbinical injunctions requiring such an action, and prescribing the nature, extent, and direction of the scissure. "This he did," says Chrysostom, "to add force to the accusation, and to increase the weight of his words by the act." His assessors, though fully agreeing with him, appear not to have followed his example in this particular, taking the high priest's action as typical and sufficiently expressive of the general sentiment. The Fathers see in it a symbol of the rending and destruction of the Jewish priesthood (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">spoken blasphemy</span>. In claiming to be the Son of God, not in a theocratic sense, but by nature. making himself one with Jehovah. This was what Caiaphas had been desiring. No more discussion was needed; Christ was self-convicted. <span class="cmt_word">What further need have we of witnesses?</span> He was doubtless relieved to find that the Prisoner had saved him from the trouble of seeking, suborning, and examining any more witnesses. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have heard;</span> <span class="accented">ye heard</span> just now. All the assembly could now testify to the truth of the allegation.

This was the punishment pronounced by the Law on blasphemy (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>); the death was, however, to be by stoning (<a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>). This detail, as they considered it, was now exclusively in the hands of the Romans. We see that this meeting, which virtually doomed Christ to death, was not a regular council of the Sanhedrin; for it was not held in the appointed chamber, and was conducted at night, when criminal processes were forbidden. The meeting next morning (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1</a>) was convened for the purpose of considering how this informal sentence should be executed.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a></div><div class="verse">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i>him</i> with the palms of their hands,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 67.</span> - The scene that ensued upon the verdict being pronounced is beyond measure hideous and unexampled. When the meeting broke up, Jesus was for a time left to the brutal cruelty and the unbridled insolence of the guards and servants. Involuntarily, by their profanity and coarseness, they fulfilled the words of the prophet, speaking in the Person of Messiah, "I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did they spit in his face.</span> A monstrous indignity, so regarded by all people at all times (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-14.htm">Numbers 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Buffeted him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">struck him with fists. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Smote him with the palms of their hands</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). There is some doubt whether the verb here means "to smite with a rod" or "to slap in the face with the open hand;" but as we have already had mention of striking with the hands, it is probable that beating with a stick is here intended.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-69.htm">Matthew 26:69</a></div><div class="verse">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 69-75.</span> - <span class="accented">The three denials of St. Peter.</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-66.htm">Mark 14:66-72</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-55.htm">Luke 22:55-62</a>; <a href="../../par/john/18-17.htm">John 18:17, 18, 25-27</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 69.</span> - There is much apparent discrepancy in the four accounts of Peter's denials, both as regards the scene, the persons, and the words used. St. Matthew groups them all together in one view without special regard to time and place. The fact doubtless is this - that Peter did not distinctly three times, in three separate utterances, deny Christ, but that on three occasions, and under different circumstances, and in many different words, he committed this sin. There are, as it were, three groups of questions and replies, and the evangelists have recorded such portions of these details as seemed good to them, or such as they were best acquainted with. <span class="cmt_word">Peter sat</span> (<span class="accented">was sitting</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>without in the palace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>). We have seen (ver. 48) that Peter was introduced by John into the open court round which the palace was built, and on one side of which was the chamber in which the examination of Jesus was going on. He was within the palace enclosure, but outside the principal apartment; hence he is said in the text to have been without. Admission to the courtyard was gained by a passage through the side of a house, which formed the vestibule or porch; this was closed towards the street by a heavy gate, having in it a small wicket for the use of visitors, kept by a porter or other servant. <span class="cmt_word">A damsel.</span> This was the female porteress who kept the wicket by which Peter was admitted. She appears to have had some suspicion of him from the first, and to have followed him with her remarks from the gate, and to have continued them when he sat down with the servants at the fire kindled in the open court. <span class="cmt_word">Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</span> She says, "Thou also" in reference to John, whom she had first admitted, and who seems to have been in no danger, though Peter had great fears for his own safety. Though the porteress probably had no personal knowledge of the apostle, yet scanning his features by the light of the fire, noting his perturbed aspect and his restless actions, and reflecting on his companionship with John, she conjectured that he was a disciple of Christ, and more than once hazarded the assertion with the view of eliciting a definite answer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-70.htm">Matthew 26:70</a></div><div class="verse">But he denied before <i>them</i> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 70.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He denied before them all.</span> This was the first batch of accusations and denials. The equivocal denial was made vehemently and openly, so that all around heard it. It does not seem that he would have incurred any danger if he had boldly confessed his discipleship, so that this renunciation was gratuitous and unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">I know not what thou sayest.</span> This is virtually a denial of the allegation made, though in an indirect and evasive form, implying, "I do not know what you are alluding to." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/26-71.htm">Matthew 26:71</a></div><div class="verse">And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i>maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i>fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 71.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The porch</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. The passage between the street and the court. Peter had walked towards the gate, either in unmeaning restlessness, or with some notion of escaping further questioning. <span class="cmt_word">Another maid saw him.</span> We gather from the other accounts that both the porteress and some other domestics assailed him at this time. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus of Nazareth.</span> Christ was popularly so known (see <a href="../../par/matthew/21-11.htm">Matthew 21:11</a>).

He was thoroughly determined not to compromise himself, and to silence all suspicion. This was the second stage of his fall. <span class="cmt_word">I do not know the man</span>. I have no knowledge of this Jesus of whom you are speaking. He calls his beloved Master "the man"!

Meantime had occurred the examination and informal condemnation of Christ, followed by the brutalities of the attendants, and the Lord's temporary  consignment to some chamber or gallery that overlooked the courtyard. The excitement of the trial and its accompaniments having somewhat subsided, attention was again turned upon Peter, who, in his nervous trepidation, could not remain quiet and silent, but aroused observation by his indiscreet movements and garrulity. <span class="cmt_word">They that stood by.</span> Among whom, as St. John notes, was a kinsman of Malthus, who indistinctly remembered hating seen Peter at Gethsemane. Probably by this time some rumour of the presence of a disciple of Jesus had spread among the crowd, and there arose an eager desire to discover him. If Peter had not talked, he might have escaped further notice. <span class="cmt_word">Thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">speech bewrayeth thee;</span> <span class="accented">makes thee known.</span> His dialect (for doubtless he spoke Aramaic) showed that he was a Galilaean, and as most of Christ's adherents came from that region, they inferred that he was one of Christ's disciples. The language and pronunciation of the northern district differed materially from the polished dialect of Judaea and Jerusalem, and its provincialisms were readily detected. The Galilaeans, we are told, could not properly pronounce the guttural letters, <span class="accented">aleph, kheth</span>, and <span class="accented">ayin</span>, and used <span class="accented">tau</span> for <span class="accented">shin, pe</span> for <span class="accented">beth</span>, etc.; they also often omitted syllables in words, occasioning equivocal mistakes, which afforded much amusement to the better instructed.

There is a certain gradation in his denials: he first simply asserts; he then asserts with an oath; lastly, he adds curses to his oath. "One temptation unresisted seldom fails to be followed by another; a second and greater infidelity is the punishment of the first, and often the cause of a third. Peter joins perjury to infidelity. Deplorable progress of infidelity and blindness in an apostle in so short a time, only out of fear of some under servants, and in respect of a Master whom he had acknowledged very God.
