Of these he instances three: alms (vers. 2-4), prayer (vers. 5-8, 9-15), fasting (vers. 16-18). It is, indeed, true that the performance of these duties on special occasions was implied in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-15</a>); but there are no regulations concerning their observance in ordinary and daily life. These were matters of custom and tradition; to this the <span class="accented">Law</span>, in its original aim and method, did not extend.

If "but" is genuine, as is on the whole more probable, our Lord places this warning in close relation to the preceding charge. Aim at "perfection," but beware of mere show.

Probably a purely metaphorical expression (cf. our "He is his own trumpeter"). Edersheim, 'Temple,' etc., p. 27 (cf. Schottgen) sees rather in it an ironical allusion to the form and name of the treasure-chests in the court of the women. "The Lord, making use of the word 'trumpet,' describes the conduct of those who, in their almsgiving, sought glory from men as 'sounding a trumpet' before them - that is, carrying before them, as it were, in full display one of these trumpet-shaped alms-boxes (literally called in the Talmud, 'trumpets'), and, as it were, sounding it." This interpretation would have been less fanciful if the substantive had been used instead of the verb. Others (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Calvin, Bengel) have taken it of a literal trumpet; but of this practice there is no evidence whatever. "I have not found, although I have sought for it much and seriously, even the least mention of a trumpet in almsgiving" (J. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). <span class="cmt_word">Before thee;</span> part of the metaphor, since one holds a trumpet up to one's mouth. <span class="cmt_word">As the hypocrites do.</span> The comma after "<span class="accented">do"</span> in the ordinary text of the Authorized Version (not in Scrivener) connects "do not sound a trumpet before thee" with "in the synagogues," etc., and more readily <span class="accented">suggests</span> the literal interpretation of "trumpet" to the English reader. <span class="accented">The hypocrites</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). In Attic usage the word means those who play a part upon the stage. Hence, by an easy transition to the moral sphere," hypocrisy" became used in later Greek of "the assumption of a part which masked [men's] genuine feelings, and made them appear otherwise than they were" (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>). Persons who assumed this part would indeed often be identical with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and the term <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> may sometimes be used as synonymous with these (an extension of language which would be the more easy as the Hebrew word for "hypocrite" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5e4;</span>) implies not so much hypocrisy as pollution by sin); but there seems no need (contrast Hatch, 'Essays,' p. 91) to see any other connotation in the New Testament than "hypocrite." To wilfully and continuously attempt to produce a false impression - especially in religion - is, after all, a mark of extreme distance from the truth-loving God. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the synagogues and in the streets</span> (ver. 5, note). <span class="cmt_word">That they may have glory of men</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%pw</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); instead of this glory being given to God (ch. 5:16). The thought, however, of the word is rather of the glory given than of their welcome reception of it (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>; contrast <a href="../../par/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span> (ch. 5:18, note). <span class="cmt_word">They have;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">they have received</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The force of the preposition is "correspond<span class="accented">ence</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the contents to the capacity, of the possession to the desire, etc., so that it denotes <span class="accented">the full</span> complement" (Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). That which fully corresponds to their desires and their rightful expectation they have to the full. They therefore have (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) no other reward left for them to receive (ver. 1). Schottgen gives several examples of Jewish sayings about men receiving their reward in this life only (cf. Ign., 'Polyc.,' &sect; 5, "If a man boast [of his chastity], he is lost").

It was not that the synagogue was more convenient (he is, of course, thinking of their private prayers), or that they were accidentally overtaken by the prayer-hour when in the street, but their innate love of display made them choose these places "that they may be seen of men" (cf. ver. 16, and contrast ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">To pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets</span>; <span class="accented">to stand and pray</span>, etc. (Revised Version), giving, however, slightly more emphasis on "stand" than its position warrants.

For most suggestive remarks on the Lord's Prayer, both generally and in its greater difficulties of detail, compare by all means Chase, 'The Lord's Prayer in the Early Church:' (Cambridge Texts and Studies). Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If the prayer had already been given by the Lord in the sermon on the mount, "one of his disciples" would hardly afterwards have asked him to teach them to pray, as John also taught his disciples (<a href="../../par/luke/11.htm">Luke 11</a>. l). It is much more easy, therefore, to consider that the original occasion of its utterance is recorded by St. Luke, and that it therefore did not belong to the sermon on the mount as that discourse was originally delivered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A question that admits of a more doubtful answer is whether the more original form of the prayer is found in Matthew or in Luke. It will be remembered that in the true text of his Gospel, the latter does not record the words, "Which art in heaven," "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth," "But deliver us from evil," besides reading "day by day" instead of "this day," "sins" instead of "debts," and "for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us" instead of" as we also have forgiven our debtors." Most writers suppose St. Matthew's form to be the original, and St. Luke's to be only a shortened form. In favour of this are the considerations that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> St. Matthew's words, "Forgive us our debts," represent an older, because parabolic, form of expression than the apparently interpretative "Forgive us our sins" in St. Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> St. Matthew's words, "as we also," seem to be expanded into "for we ourselves also," in St. Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> St. Luke's "day by day" occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in his writings (<a href="../../par/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>), so that it is likely to be his own phrase, and therefore less original than St. Matthew's "this day" (cf. Weiss, 'Matthiaus-Ev.,' and Page, <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, III. 7:436). On the ether hand, the words, "Which art in heaven," are so characteristic of St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32, 33</a>; cf. 12:50; 15:13; 18:10, 14, 19, 35; 23. 9), and especially of the sermon on the mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11, 21</a>; cf. 5:45, 48; 6:14, 26, 32), that it seems more natural to suppose that this clause at least was added by him or by the authors of his sources to the original form, rather than that it was omitted by St. Luke. In connexion with this it may be pointed out how easy it was for our Lord to say only "Father" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>) immediately after his own prayer to him (<a href="../../par/luke/11-1.htm">Luke 11:1</a>). Taking everything into consideration, it seems reasonable to arrive at two conclusions. First, that the form in Luke presents, <span class="accented">as a whole</span>, the more primitive and original instruction of the Lord, and that that given in Matthew presents the Lord's words as fully developed, partly perhaps by himself directly, partly by his indirect guidance of Christian usage. St. Matthew's Gospel would thus at once both show the effect and be the cause of the preference for the longer form in liturgical use. Secondly, and more exactly, that both the evangelists record the prayer after it had passed through some development in different parts of the Church, St. Matthew giving it a generally later stage, but preserving one or two clauses in an earlier and better form. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this manner therefore</span>. <span class="accented">Therefore</span>; in contrast to the heathen practice, and in the full confidence which you have in your almighty Father's intuitive knowledge of your needs. <span class="accented">After this manner</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). Not "in these words;" but he will most closely imitate the manner who most often reminds himself of it by using the words. <span class="cmt_word">Pray ye</span>. "Ye" emphatic - ye my disciples; ye the children of such a Father. <span class="cmt_word">Our</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father</span>. In English we just lack the power to keep, with a plural possessive pronoun (contrast "father mine"), the order of Christ's words (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) which other languages possess (<span class="accented">Pater noster</span>; <span class="accented">Vater unser</span>). Christ places in the very forefront the primary importance of the recognition of spiritual relationship to God. There is no direct thought here of God as the All-Father in the modern and often deistic sense. Yet it is affirmed elsewhere in Scripture   (<a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/15-21.htm">Luke 15:21</a>), and spiritual relationship is perhaps only possible because of the natural relationship (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, note). <span class="accented">Our.</span> Though the prayer is here given with special reference to praying alone (ver. 6), the believer is to be reminded at once that he is joined by spiritual relationship to many others who have the same needs, etc., as himself. <span class="cmt_word">Which art in heaven</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). Added in this fuller form of the prayer (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), on the one hand to definitely exclude the application of the words however mediately to any human teacher (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>), and on the other to remind those who pray of the awful majesty of him whom they address. "They are a <span class="accented">Sursum corda</span>; they remind us that now we have lifted up our hearts from earth and things earthly to another and a higher world" (Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). <span class="cmt_word">Hallowed be thy name</span>. The first of the three prayers for the furtherance of God's cause. Their parallelism is seen much more clearly in the Greek than in the English order of the words. Thy name. We look on a name almost as an accidental appendage by which a person is designated, but in its true idea it is the designation of a person which exactly answers to his nature and qualities. Hence the full Name of God is properly that description of him which embraces all that he really is. As, however, the term "name" implies that it is expressed, it must, when it is used of God, be limited to that portion of his nature and qualities which can be expressed in human terms, because it has been already made known to us. The "name" of God, here and elsewhere in the Bible, therefore, does not mean God in his essence, but rather that manifestation of himself which he has been pleased to give, whether partial and preparatory as under the old covenant (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a> [16:13]; 32:29; <a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5</a>), or final as under the new (cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>); or again (to take another division found in Exell's 'Biblical Illustrator,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) the manifestation of himself through nature, through inspired words, through the Incarnation. Compared with the Glory (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) "the Name expresses the revelation as it is apprehended and used by man. Man is called by the Name, and employs it. The Glory expresses rather the manifestation of the Divine as Divine, as a partial disclosure of the Divine Majesty not directly intelligble by man (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>, ft.)" (Bishop Westcott,' Add. Note' on <a href="../../par/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1:7</a>). <span class="accented">Hallowed be.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> cannot here, as sometimes (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>), mean "be made holy," for this God's manifestation of himself already is; but "be counted holy," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in human judgment. The prayer is that God's manifestation of himself may be acknowledged and revered as the one supreme standard of truth and the one means of knowing God and approaching him; of <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, where "<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> obviously means 'set apart, enshrined as the object of supreme, absolute reverence, as free from all defilement and possessed of all excellence'" (Johnstone, <span class="accented">in lee.</span>); cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>. The same thought appears to have been the basis of the early Western alternative petition (Marcion's or Tertullian's, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Herr, 'App.,' <a href="../../par/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>) for the gift of the Holy Spirit; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the address to the Father was followed by a prayer for purification by the Holy Spirit preparatory to the prayer, "Thy kingdom come." A man must accept God's manifestation of himself before he can take part in the spread of the kingdom. Gregory of Nyssa (<span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Herr, lee. <span class="accented">cit.</span>, and Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 398) says distinctly, "Let thy Holy Spirit come upon us and purify us;" but he <span class="accented">substitutes</span> this prayer for the words, "Thy kingdom come." (For the support afforded by this to the theory that the Lord's Prayer circulated in a varying form, cf. Chase, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.) Gregory's petition, as affecting only humanity, is less comprehensive than that found m o r Gospels. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <i>it is</i> in heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy kingdom</span> <span class="cmt_word">come.</span> Let there come the full establishment of thy realm. The prayer passes from the personal acceptance in the heart of God's revelation of himself to the consequent result. The clause has a much wider meaning than the development and spread of the Church, or even the personal return of Christ at the second advent. It speaks of that which shall be the issue of both this and that, the final and perfect establishment of God's realm, in which all men will do him willing service, and all habits and customs, individual and social, will be such as he approves of (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 25.). Dr. C. Taylor ('Sayings,' etc., Exc. 5.) points out that the coming of the kingdom and the sanctifying of the Name are brought together in <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>; Weiss, ' Life,' 2:349, with many others, says that our Lord probably adapted the frequent Jewish prayer for the coming of the kingdom of Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thy will</span> <span class="cmt_word">be done.</span> Let thy will come into complete existence (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>; cf. "Let there be light," <a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>, LXX.). The thought is not merely God's will realized in this or that action, whether performed or endured by us (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-42.htm">Matthew 26:42</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-14.htm">Acts 21:14</a>), but God's will as a whole coming into full being. God's will is always in ideal until it is accomplished in act. The connexion of the clause with what has gone before is therefore this - the acceptance of God's manifestation of himself leads to the establishment of his realm, and this to the realization of his will, which until then is only ideal (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, note, end). If this be all the meaning of the words, they express, in fact, only the ultimate result of the consummation prayed for in the preceding clause (hence this portion of the prayer was in itself complete without our present words; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/11-2.htm">Luke 11:2</a>); but since it is so far a distinct thought that it would not immediately suggest itself, it has a worthy place in the fuller form of the prayer. Possibly, however, more may be intended. The full establishment of the kingdom may be only a part of his loving will, which may, for all we know, have countless other things in view. The highest prayer that we can make in the furtherance of God's cause is that his gracious purpose, his will (whatever it may include) may be fully brought about. In earth, as it is in heaven; <span class="accented">as in heaven</span>, <span class="accented">so on earth</span> (Revised Version). Probably the words are to be joined to only the immediately preceding clause. In heaven God's will is already realized; not yet on earth, where sin has entered.

Acts 16:11; 20:15; 21:18), "bread for the coming day," i.e. the same day, if the prayer be said in the morning; the next day if it be said in the evening (so Bishop Lightfoot). Between (3) (a) and (3) (b) it is very difficult to decide. Against (a) is the fact that it is hard to say why the common form ejpi>onta would not have served; against (b), while the use of the word is perfectly consistent with casting all care upon God for to-morrow (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>), there still remains the fact that there is some tautology in saying, "Our bread for the coming day give us to-day," or even the formula in the parallel passage in Luke, "Our bread for the coming day give us day by day." On the whole, perhaps (3) (a) presents the least difficulties. Bread. It is very doubtful if to use this petition of spiritual food is anything more than a legitimate application (made, indeed, as early as the 'Didache,' &sect; 10.) of words which in themselves refer only to material food (see further Chase, loc. cit.).

As such it cannot, indeed, always be granted, since in exceptional cases this may be part of the permission given to the prince of this world. So it was in our Lord's case (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-41.htm">Matthew 26:41</a>, and context).

Chase (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) shows that the primary notion of both <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and its Hebrew equivalent <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span>, is not malignity (Trench), but worthless ness, essential badness.

In the 'Didache,' &sect;&sect; 8, 9, 10, however, we find our doxology with very little other variation than the omission of "the kingdom," this itself being explained in the two latter sections by the immediately preceding mention of the kingdom. Similar omissions of one or more of the three terms, "kingdom, power, glory," are found in the Old Syriac, an "African" text of the Old Latin, and the Thebaic. "It was probably derived ultimately from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a> (Hebrews), but, it may be, through the medium of some contemporary Jewish usage: the people's response to prayers in the temple is said to have been 'Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom for ever and ever'" (Westcott and Hort, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>). Indeed, it was so usual for doxologies of one kind or another to be added by the Jews to prayers, that, though we cannot for one moment accept the words here as genuine, we must consider it very doubtful in the Lord's Prayer was ever used in Jewish circles without a doxology, or that our Lord, as Man, ever intended it to be so used (cf. further, Taylor, 'Lectures,' p. 64). At all events, the feeling of the Christian Church in using the doxology is fully justified by its contents; for it places us more emphatically than ever in a right relation to God. By our praise to him it induces in us the remembrance that it is to God's <span class="accented">kingdom</span> that we belong, having him for King and Source of law; that it is by God's <span class="accented">power</span> that we live on earth and stand freed from Satan's grasp; that it is for the furtherance of God's <span class="accented">glory</span> that all has been done for us, all wrought in us, all these petitions are now made and all our hopes and aims are directed. Hereafter, as Bengel says. the whole prayer will be doxology: "Hallowed be the Name of our God. His kingdom has come; his will is done. He has forgiven us our sins. He has brought our temptation to an end; He has delivered us from the evil one. His is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever. Amen."

The thought of the power which treasure has of attracting the heart forms the transition to the need of a pure and steady "eye" heavenwards.

If this be upon the things of this world, the soul perceives, and tends to accommodate itself to the things of this world; if upon things in heaven, it perceives, and tends to accommodate itself to, the things in heaven.

As the bodily eye is not itself light, but only an instrument for receiving and imparting light, so in the mere gaze of the soul there is no inherent light, but it is the means of receiving and imparting light to the soul. <span class="cmt_word">If</span> <span class="cmt_word">therefore thine eye be single.</span> The word "single" (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) presents some difficulty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> If it meant "undivided," it would doubtless continue the illustration of the lamp, with an undivided as contrasted with a divided wick, but it has no such meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It states the opposite, not to divisions, but to folds (<span class="accented">vide</span> Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 56.); it is "single" as opposed to "plicate," and therefore can hardly contain any direct reference to the lamp. Its meaning rather appears to be purely metaphorical, and the word seems to be applied 'directly to the functions of the eye in relation to the body. If the eye be "single" and (to use another but related metaphor) straightforward in its working, then the body receives through it the light that it ought to receive. So is it with the gaze of the soul in its effect on the inner man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Perhaps, however, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x3b7;</span> is here used in the sense of non-compound (cf. Plato, 'Rep.,' 547. E); in this case free from any foreign substance to bar the light from passing through it (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-3.htm">Matthew 7:3</a>, and Basil, 'De Spiritu Sancto,' 9. &sect; 23, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy whole body shall be full of light</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

The word chosen seems to indicate, not merely that the body is, through the eye, lighted, but also that it itself becomes in measure, like the eye, full of light for others. All one's powers become illumined with the Divine light, and the illumination shines through. <span class="cmt_word">But if thine eye be evil</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); ver. 13, note. Vitiated, worthless. As an eye that does not fulfil its natural function, so is that gaze  of the soul which is directed only earthward. To limit tiffs, with Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.'), to covetousness (cf. also Hatch, 'Essays,' p. 81), is far too partial an interpretation. Such an earthward and selfish gaze of the soul may often issue in selfishness as regards money (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>), but the full meaning of the phrase includes very much more. <span class="cmt_word">Thy whole body shall be full of darkness</span>. What the heart craves to see it sees; but in this case, not light makes its entrance, but darkness, which, as in the case of the light, permeates the frame. <span class="cmt_word">If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is darkness</span>; the change here to the indicative (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>) indicating that the last preceding clause is assumed as fact. <span class="accented">The light that is in thee.</span> Our Lord does not say, "the light that comes through the eye," for he means more than this, viz. that the very information, so to speak, brought first by the outlook of the soul, comes into us and remains in us. He assumes that this, which ought to be light, is darkness. <span class="cmt_word">How great is that darkness!</span> <span class="accented">i.e. the darkness</span> (Revised Version)just spoken of, which comes through the eye. So, probably, <a href="../../par/luke/11-35.htm">Luke 11:35</a>. If' the gaze which should bring light brings only darkness, how terrible in its nature and effects must that darkness be! It is, however, possible to understand our Lord to refer in this verse to the natural darkness of the soul before it looks out of itself. In this case the thought is - you need a fixed gaze heavenwards; if your gaze is not heavenwards, it brings darkness instead of light; how black, then, must be the natural darkness! (cf. especially Trench, ' Sermon on the Mount'). It will be noticed that in these verses darkness, though scientifically only negative - the absence of light  - is here represented as positive, because it is the symbol of sin and evil.

As the word "mammon" comes twice in that parable, but nowhere else in the New Testament, it is probable that its occurrence caused the insertion of this saying in that place (cf. ver. 22, note). <span class="accented">No man can serve two masters.</span> The thought is still of earnestness of purpose and singleness of heart. Our Lord here speaks of the impossibility of such divided service as he has been warning his disciples against attempting. No man can give due service to two masters. For, apart from the extent of the claim of each master - total bond-service (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) - thorough service of two masters is incompatible with the effects produced upon the servant himself. The result of service is to incline him towards the one master and against the other. Notice how our Lord continues his plan of setting forth the moral effect of modes of thought or action upon the agents themselves (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For either he will hate the one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and love the other.</span> Because human nature is such that it must attach itself to one of two principles.

A repetition of the statement of the impossibility of serving two masters, but more than a repetition, for it is enforced by defining who the masters are. <span class="accented">Mammon.</span> The change in the Revised Version from a capital to a small <span class="accented">m</span> has probably been made to prevent "mammon" being understood as the proper name of some god. The derivation of the word (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span>) is very doubtful. The most probable suggestion is that it is formed from the stem of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, and is equivalent to that which is apportioned or counted (cf. Levy, 'Neuheb. Worterb.,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span>; Edersheim, 'Life,' 2. p. 269). Hence its well-known meaning of property, wealth, especially money. Observe that our Lord does not here contrast God and Satan; he is emphasizing the thought which he has been adducing since ver. 19, viz., the relation that his disciples must hold to things of earth, which are summed up by him under the term "mammon" as with us under the term "wealth." Observe also that it is not the possession of wealth that he condemns, but the serving it, making it an object of thought and pursuit. Gathering it and using it in the service of and according to the will of God is not serving mammon (cf. Weiss, 'Matthaus-Ev.'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-34.</span> - These verses, with the exception of the last, which should perhaps hardly be included, are very similar to the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22-32</a>. It seems probable that in the differences Luke preserves the more original form (cf. the notes on the separate verses, <span class="accented">infra</span>). What their original position was is another question. Their immediate sequence in Luke to the parable of the rich fool is no doubt perfectly natural, and is accepted by most commentators as original; but the connexion with the context here is so close that, especially with the probabilities of the case in vers. 22, 23, and ver. 24, St. Matthew <span class="cmt_word"></span> may, after all, have recorded them in their original place. Our Lord says in these verses, "Dare to follow out this warning that I have given you about double service into your daily life. Do not give way to anxiety about the things of life, but look up to God in steady gaze of faith; he will provide." 'Or, more in detail - If God has given you life, shall he not add the food and the clothing (ver. 25)? Anxiety about the support of your life is needless (witness the birds, ver. 26) and powerless (witness the limit of a man's life, ver. 27); while as for clothing, it is equally needless (witness the flowers, ver. 28) and comparatively powerless (witness Solomon's own case, ver. 29). Remember your relation to God (ver. 30). Therefore do not give way to the least anxiety about these things (ver. 31), because this is to fall to the level of the Gentiles, and also because God, whose children you are, knows your needs (ver. 32). But make his cause, without and within, your great object, and all your needs shall be supplied (ver. 33). Therefore be not at all anxious, bear the burden of each day only as each day comes round (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Because of this fact last mentioned, the impossibility of dividing your service.

The translation of the Authorized Version, which was quite correct in its day (cf. also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>), is now archaic, and therefore often misunderstood. For the popular derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> ("division," "distraction"), cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>, "But he that is married is anxious for (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;</span>) the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)."

The less general term, "ravens" (even though these are "of all the birds of Jerusalem decidedly the most characteristic and conspicuous," Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 187), and the change of construction apparent in "which have no store-chamber nor barn," point to St. Luke having preserved the more original form of the saying.

Though there are many kinds of lilies in Palestine, and some of brilliant colouring (particularly the purple and white Huleh lily found round Nazareth), yet none of them grows in such abundance as to give the tone to the colouring of the flowers generally. It seems, therefore, probable that the word is employed loosely. So, perhaps, in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31, 33, 34</a>, and other passages, where it represents the "flowers" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>) on the candlestick.

The shade of difference here and ver. 34 from ver. 25 cannot be expressed in an English translation. In ver. 25 a state of anxiety, here and ver. 34: one anxious thought, is forbidden.

"Of God" must almost certainly be omitted with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">B</span>); cf. Westcott and Hort, 'App.' The first phrase represents rather the external, the second the internal aim. Seek ye the spread and accomplishment of God's kingdom; seek ye personal conformity to his standard of righteousness. Both thoughts are of fundamental importance for this "sermon" (<span class="accented">kingdom</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3, 10, 19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>; <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, especially <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-20</a>), which treats essentially of the way in which the subjects of the Divine <span class="accented">kingdom</span> should regard the Divine <span class="accented">righteousness</span> and conform to it. And all these things shall be added unto you; cf. the apocryphal saying of our Lord, repeated by Origen (Clem.

Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof</span>. Matthew only. Luke's conclusion to this section ("Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom") is perhaps more closely connected with the preceding verse, and also grander as dwelling upon God's side; but Matthew's is more practical, dealing with the subject from man's side. Christ says, "Because all needful things shall be added, do not have one anxious thought for the future, even for what is coming on the very next day." Such anxiety shows a want of common sense, for each day brings its own burden of anxiety for itself. Christ here seems to allow anxiety for each day <span class="accented">as it comes round.</span> "But," he says, "put off your to-morrow's anxiety until to-morrow." If this be done, the greater part of all our anxiety is put aside at once, and, for the rest of it, the principle will apply to each hour as well as to each day (cf. Bengel). The Christian will ever try to follow the inspired advice of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>) and St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). <span class="accented">The morrow shall take thought for</span>; "be anxious" as <span class="accented">supra.
