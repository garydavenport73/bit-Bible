Lects.,' p. 179): "That the beginning and end of the Sermon are nearly identical in both Gospels; that the precepts, as recited by St. Luke, are in the same general order as those in St. Matthew, and that they are often expressed in nearly the same words; and lastly, that each Evangelist specifies the same miracle, viz. the healing of the centurion's servant, as having taken place shortly after the Sermon, on our Lord's entry into Capernaum." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-16.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">The ideal character of his disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">beati</span>; hence "Beatitudes."

It describes them in reference to their inherent state, not to the gifts or the rewards that they receive.

Poverty of spirit stands in contrast to self sufficiency (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>) and as such is perhaps the quality which is most of all opposed to the Jewish temper in all ages (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>).

As recently in the synagogue at Nazareth (<a href="../../par/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18, 19</a>), so also here, he bases the explanation of his work on the prophecy of that work in the Book of Isaiah.

Hence Tertullian ('Adv. Marc.,' 4:14; cf. 15)purposely altered <span class="accented">Beati pauperes</span> of the Old Latin to <span class="accented">Beati mendici</span>, and elsewhere ('De Idol.,' 12) rendered it by <span class="accented">egeni.</span> But in Hellenistic Greek, so far as the usage of the LXX. and the Hexapla goes (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hatch, 'Biblical Greek,' p. 73), the distinction seems hardly to hold good. Hatch even infers - on, we think, very insufficient premisses  -  that these two words, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>), designate the poor of an oppressed country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peasantry, the <span class="accented">fellahin</span> of Palestine as a class, and he considers it probable that this special meaning underlies the use of the words in these verses. Whether this be the case or not, the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> completely excludes the supposition that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> meant to refer to any merely external circumstances. <span class="accented">In spirit</span>; Matthew only (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>).

Christ here affirms the blessedness of those who are in their spirit absolutely devoid of wealth. It cannot mean that they are this in God's opinion, for in God's opinion all are so. It means, therefore, that they are this in their own opinion. While many feel in themselves a wealth of soul-satisfaction, these do not, but realize their insufficiency. Christ says that they realize this "in (their) spirit;" for the spirit is that part of us which specially craves for satisfaction, and which is the means by which we lay hold of true satisfaction. The actual craving for spiritual wealth is not mentioned in this verse. It is implied, but direct mention of it comes partly in ver. 4, and especially in ver. 6. <span class="accented">For theirs.</span> Emphatic, as in all the Beatitudes (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>,). <span class="accented">Is.</span> Not hereafter (Meyer), but even already. <span class="accented">The kingdom of heaven</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> note, p. 150). The poor in spirit already belong to and have a share in that realm of God which now is realized chiefly in relation to our spirit, but ultimately will be realized in relation to every element of our nature, and to all other persons, and to every part, animate and inanimate, of the whole world. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>are</i> they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In some, especially "Western" authorities, vers. 4, 5 are transposed (<span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'Appendix'), possibly because the terms of ver. 5 seemed to be more closely parallel to ver. 3 (cf. Meyer, Weiss), and also those of ver. 4 fitted excellently with ver. 6. But far the greater balance of evidence is in favour of the usual order, which also, though not on the surface, is in the deepest connexion with the preceding and the following verses. They that mourn (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-2.htm">Isaiah 61:2</a>). Our Lord does not define that which causes the mourning, but as the preceding and the following verses all refer to the religious or at least the ethical sphere, merely carnal and worldly mourning is excluded. The mourning referred to must, therefore, be produced by religious or moral causes. Mourners for the state of Israel, so far as they mourned not for its political but for its spiritual condition (cf. similar mourning in the Christian Church, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9, 10</a>), would be included (cf. Weiss, 'Life,' 2:142); but our Lord's primary thought must have been of mourning over one's personal state, not exactly, perhaps, over one's sins, but over the realized poverty in spirit just spoken of (cf. Weiss-Meyer). As the deepest poverty lies in the sphere of the spirit, so the deepest mourning lies there also. All other mourning is but partial and slight compared with this (<a href="../../par/proverbs/18-14.htm">Proverbs 18:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For they shall be comforted</span>. When? On having the kingdom of heaven (ver. 3); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> during this life in measure (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a>), but fully only hereafter. The mourning over one's personal poverty in spirit is removed in proportion as Christ is received and appropriated; but during this life such appropriation can be only partial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>are</i> the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are the meek.</span> In this Beatitude our Lord still quotes Old Testament expressions. The phrase, "shall inherit the earth," comes even in <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>,  only two verses before Isaiah 61:1, 2, to which he has already referred. In the present copies of the LXX. it is found also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>, but there it is evidently a corruption. It occurs also in <a href="../../par/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9, 11, 22, 29, 34</a>; and since in the eleventh verse of the psalm it is directly said of the meek: "But the meek shall inherit the land (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>)," it is, doubtless, from this latter passage that our Lord borrows the phrase. The meaning attributed by our Lord to the word <span class="accented">meek</span> is not clear. The ordinary use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in the New Testament refers solely to the relation of men to men, and this is the sense in which <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is taken by most commentators here. But with this sense, taken barely and solely, there seems to be no satisfactory explanation of the position of the Beatitude. Vers. 3 and 4 refer to men in their relation to God; ver. 6, to say the least, includes the relation of men to God; what has ver. 5 to do here if it refers solely to the relation of men to men? It would have come very naturally either before or after ver. 9 ("the peacemakers"); but why here? The reason, however, for the position of the Beatitude lies in the true conception of meekness. While the thought is here primarily that of meekness exhibited towards men (as is evident from the implied contrast <span class="accented">in they shall inherit the earth</span>), yet meekness towards men is closely connected with, and is the result of, meekness towards God. This is not exactly humility (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, which, as regards God, is equivalent to a sense of creatureliness or dependence; cf. Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 42.). Meekness is rather the attitude of the soul towards another when that other is in a state of activity towards it. It is the attitude of the disciple to the teacher when teaching; of the son to the father when exercising his paternal authority; of the servant to the master when giving him orders. It is therefore essentially as applicable to the relation of man to God as to that of man to man. It is for this reason that we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span>very frequently used of man's relation to God, in fact, more often than of man's relation to man; and this common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;</span> must be specially remembered here, where the phrase is taken directly from the Old Testament. Weiss ('Matthaus-ev.') objects to Tholuck adducing the evidence of the Hebrew words, on the ground that the Greek terms are used solely of the relation to man, and that this usage is kept to throughout the New Testament. But the latter statement is hardly true. For, not to mention <a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, in which the reference is doubtful, <a href="../../par/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a> certainly refers to the meekness shown towards God in receiving his word. "The Scriptural <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>," says Trench, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>," is not in a man's outward behaviour only; nor yet in his relations to his fellow-men; as little in his mere natural disposition. Rather is it an inwrought grace of the soul; and the exercises of it are first and chiefly towards God (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>). It is that temper of spirit in which we accept his dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting; and it is closely linked with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, and follows directly upon it (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12</a>), because it is only the humble heart which is also the meek; and which, as such, does not fight against God, and more or less struggle and contend with him." Yet, as this meekness must be felt towards God not only in his <span class="accented">direct</span> dealings with the soul, but also in his <span class="accented">indirect</span> dealings (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by secondary means and agents), it must also be exhibited towards men. Meekness towards God necessarily issues in meekness towards men. Our Lord's concise teaching seizes, therefore, on this furthest expression of meekness. Thus it is not meekness in the relation of man to man barely staled, of which Christ here speaks, but meekness in the relation of man to man, with its prior and presupposed fact of meekness in the relation of man to God. <span class="cmt_word">Shall inherit the earth.</span> In the Psalm this is equivalent to the land of Palestine, and the psalmist means that, though the wicked may have temporary power, yet God's true servants shall really and finally have dominion in the land. But what is intended here? Probably our Lord's audience understood the phrase on his lips as a Messianic adaptation of the original meaning, and as therefore implying that those who manifested a meek reception of his will would obtain that full possession of the land of Palestine which was now denied to the Israelites through the conquest of the Romans. But to our Lord, and to the evangelist who, years after, recorded them, the meaning of the words must have been much fuller, corresponding, in fact, to the true meaning of the "kingdom of heaven," viz. that the meek <span class="accented">shall inherit</span> - shall receive, as their rightful possession from their Father, the whole earth; renewed, it may be (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-25.htm">Isaiah 65:25</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>), but still the earth (<a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>), with all the powers of nature therein implied. Of this the conquest of nature already gained through the civilization produced under Christianity is at once the promise and, though but in a small degree, the firstfruits.

As in the case of vers. 3, 4, now in part, fully hereafter. "St. Austin, wondering at the overflowing measure of God's Spirit in the Apostles' hearts, observes that the reason why they were so full of God was because they were so empty of his creatures.

The mercy referred to here is not so much the almost negative quality which the word usually suggests to us (not dealing harshly, not inflicting punishment when due, sparing an animal or a fellow-man some unnecessary labour), as active kindness to the destitute and to any who are in trouble (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/17-15.htm">Matthew 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>).

To this statement of our Lord's, that they who show mercy to those in need shall themselves be the objects of mercy (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from God) in their time of need, many parallels have been adduced, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Wetstein. Rabbi Gamaliel (? the second, circa A.D. ), as reported by Rabbi Judah (circa A.D. ), says (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 151 <span class="accented">b</span>), on <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-18.htm">Deuteronomy 13:18</a>, "Every one that showeth mercy to others, they show mercy to him from heaven, and every one that showeth not mercy to others, they show him not mercy from heaven;" cf. also ' Test.

(For the converse, cf. <a href="../../par/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>.) Calvin remarks, "Hoc etiam paradoxon cum humano judicio pugnat.

This is possible, but external evidence exists only in the case of vers. 13 and 15 (for vers. 14 and 16 are peculiar to Matthew); and even in the case of these verses it is by no means clear (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) that the occasions on which, according to the other Gospels, the sayings were uttered are the more original. Weiss's assertion  ('Life,' 2:144), "The remarks in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13-16</a>, bearing on the calling of discipleship,.., cannot belong to the sermon on the mount, carefully as they are there introduced, for the prophesied sufferings of his followers might have made them disloyal," is wholly gratuitous. In fact, the sufferings have been much more strongly spoken of in vers. 11, 12. The disciples are now addressed directly, and are urged to "walk worthily of the vocation wherewith they are called." The mention of those who have endured persecution leads our Lord to warn his disciples not to faint under persecution in any of its forms; they are but entering on the succession of the prophets; their work is that of purifying and preserving and of illuminating; they must therefore allow their character as disciples to appear, as appear it must if they arc true to their position. There is a purpose in this, namely, that men may see their actions, and glorify their Father which is in heaven. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="../../par/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22, 23</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - As ver. 10 spoke of the blessedness of those who had suffered persecution and had endured it, so this verse speaks of the blessedness of those who are suffering from it at the moment, whether it be in act or word.

In <a href="../../par/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a> he had claimed to be the Source of power for service; here he claims to be the Object of devotion. His "Messianic consciousness" (Meyer) is, at even this early stage of his ministry, fully developed (cf. also vers. 17, 22).

The doctrine of recompense, which has so large a place in Jewish thought (for a not often-sire example, cf. 'Ab.,' 2:19, Taylor) comes also in Christ's teaching. In <a href="../../par/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a> reward is expressly divested of its merely legal side, and exhibited as ultimately dependent on the will of the great Householder. But here it is mentioned without reference to the difficulties involved in the conception. These difficulties centre round the thought of obligation from God to man. But it may be doubted whether these difficulties are not caused by too exclusively regarding the metaphor of contracting, instead of considering the fact indicated by the metaphor. In God's kingdom every action has a corresponding effect, and this effect is the more certain in proportion as the action is in the sphere of morality. The idea of "quantity" hardly enters into the relation of such cause and effect. It is a question of moral correspondence. But such effect may not unfitly be called by the metaphors "hire," "reward," because, on the one hand, it is the result of conditions of moral service, and, on the other, such terms imply a Personal Will at the back of the effect, as well as a will on the part of the human "servant." (For the subject in other connexions, cf. Weiss, 'Bibl. Theol.,' &sect; 32; cf. also ver. 46; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2, 4, 5, 6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In heaven</span>.

The effect of your present faithfulness, etc., will be seen in the reception Of powers of work and usefulness and enjoyment, beside which those possessed on earth will appear small.

Not as giving a reason for the assurance of reward (apparently Meyer and Weiss), but for the command, "rejoice," and be exceeding glad, and perhaps also for the predicate "blessed."

Weiss thinks that St. Luke gives it in its original context; that St. Matthew is right in interpreting it as of special reference to the disciples; and that St. Mark applies it the most freely. It may, indeed, be that its position here is only the result of the inspired guidance of the evangelist; but, on the whole, it seems more probable that so natural a figure was used more than once by our Lord, and that he really spoke these words in his sermon on the mount, as well as on the later occasion indicated by St. Luke. <span class="accented">Ye</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> of ver. 1. <span class="accented">Are</span>, in fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>); therefore recognize the responsibility. <span class="accented">The salt of the earth.</span> It has been disputed whether allusion is here made to the preservative properties of salt or to the flavour it imparts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether Christ is thinking of his disciples as preserving the world from decay, or as giving it a good flavour to the Divine taste. Surely a useless question; forgetful of the fact that spiritual realities are being dealt with, and that it is therefore impossible for the one effect to be really separated from the other. Our Lord is thinking of the moral tone which his disciples are to give to humanity. The connexion with vers. 11, 12 is - Persecution must be borne unless you are to lose your moral tone, which is to be to the earth what salt is to its surroundings, preserving from corruption and fitting for (in your case Divine) appreciation. What <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is to be to the Christian <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>), that the Christian himself is to be to the world. <span class="cmt_word">If...  have lost its savour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>); so elsewhere in <a href="../../par/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a> only. Salt that has lost its distinctive qualities is here said to lack its proper mind or sense. Salt without sharpness is like an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; for man is a <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. On the fact of salt losing its virtue, cf. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 382: 1887), "It is a well-known fact that the salt <span class="accented">of this country</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Palestine] when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered [<span class="accented">vide infra</span>], much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all; and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust  - not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown....  No man will allow it to be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street; and there it is cast, to be trodden under foot of men." It should be observed that the salt used in Palestine is not manufactured by boiling clean salt water, nor quarried from mines, but is obtained from marshes along the seashore, as in Cyprus, or from salt lakes in the interior, which dry up in summer, as the one in the desert north of Palmyra, and the great Lake of Jebbul, south-east of Aleppo. Further, rock-salt is found in abundance at the south end of the Dead Sea (cf. Thomson, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith shall it be salted?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not if you will not act as salt, wherewith shall the earth be salted? (apparently Luther and Erasmus); but what quality can take the place of moral tone to produce in you the same result? You are as salt. If you lose your distinctive qualities, where, can you find that which answers to them? <span class="cmt_word">It is thenceforth good for nothing.</span> Our Lord here lays stress, not on want of fitness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke), but on want of inherent power. "It is only useful for that purpose to which one applies what is absolutely useless" (Weiss-Meyer). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are the light of the world</span>. After speaking of the moral tone that the disciples were to give to the world, in contrast to sin in its corrupting power, Christ refers to them as enlightening, in contrast to sin as darkness and ignorance. Our Lord further naturally exchanges the term "the earth" (which from its strong materialism had suited the figure of the salt) for "the world" - a phrase which must, indeed, as regards the disciples, be limited to this earth, but as regards the light, need not be limited to less than the solar system. In other words, the simple reason why he exchanges "earth" for "world" is that they are respectively the best suited to the figure employed. Notice that Christ never applies the former figure, of salt, to himself; but the latter, of light, once or twice, especially <a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where, since he is speaking of himself, and not of others, he adds the thought of life being connected with light, <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">city</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">a city cannot be hid when set on a mountain.</span> It seems at first slightly  awkward to introduce the figure of a city between those of the sun and the lamp, both these having to do with light. The reason is that the city is not considered as such, but only as an object which can be teen, and which cannot (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, emphatic) from its physical conditions avoid being seen. There is a true gradation in the thought of influence. The sun must be seen by all; the city, by the whole neighbourhood; the lamp, by the family. Our Lord comes from the general to the particular; from what is almost theory, at best a matter of hope and faith, to hard fact and practice. The influence you are to have - if it is to be for the whole world, as indeed it is, must be felt in the neighbourhood in which you live, and <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">fortiori</span> in the immediate circle of your own home. Conjectures have been made whether any one city can reasonably be mentioned as being in sight, and so having suggested this image to our Lord. If the exact spot where he was then sitting were itself certain, such conjectures might be worth considering. But, in fact, so many "cities" in Palestine were set on hills that the inquiry seems vain. <span class="accented">Safed</span>, some twelve miles north-west of Capernaum, the view from which extends to Tiberias (Neubaur, 'Geogr.,' p. 228), has been accepted by many, but evidence is lacking for it having been a city at that time. Tabor, at the south-west of the lake, has also been thought of, and at all events seems to have been then a fortified town. The view from it is even more extensive than from <span class="accented">Safed</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Socin's Baedeker, p. 365).

All four passages have too much verbal similarity to admit of any of them being absolutely independent. <a href="../../par/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a> has the greatest number of peculiarities. The two passages in Luke agree very closely with each other, but of the two, <a href="../../par/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a> most resembles Matthew. The close agreement here with the context seems to point to this being an original position of the utterance. Of the other two contexts <a href="../../par/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>, if we must choose, seems the more natural.

Lowe, 'Fragment of Pesachim,' 1879, p. 95; cf. also Driver on <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>) it would have been found also before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. "The description applies to the common houses of the people. In each there was one principal room, in which they ate and slept; the lampstand, with its single light, the flour-bin, and the bed, with a few seats, were all its furniture" (Cook, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' on <a href="../../par/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a> ). <span class="accented">A bushel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

The Latin <span class="accented">modius</span>, here used to render <span class="accented">scab</span>, itself held nearly a peck. In <a href="../../par/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a> the vaguer term <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used. "Bushel" is retained in the Revised Version probably because it can be used of the vessel apart from all thought of measure; cf. "The Sense represents the Sun no bigger than a Bushel" (Hale [1677], in Murray's 'Oxford Dictionary'). <span class="accented">But on a candlestick</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">but on the stand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); Vulgate, from Old Latin, <span class="accented">Neque accendunt lucernam et possunt cam sub modio sed super candelabrum.

The negative of this verse is given in Pseudo-Cyprian, 'De Aleat.,' 3, "Monet dominus et dicit: nolite contris tare Spiritum Sanctum, qui in vobis est, et <span class="accented">nolite exstinguere lumen</span>, <span class="accented">quod in vobis efful sit"</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 111, 215).

Our Lord has here no thought of effort in shining, such as may improve the brightness of the light given, or of illuminating others, but of not concealing what light the disciples have.

This is actually done in ch. 9:8; 15:31. St. Peter's language (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>) is probably due to a reminiscence of our Lord's words. <span class="cmt_word">Your Father which is in heaven</span>. The Fatherhood of God is here predicated in a special sense of the disciples, in the same way as the Fatherhood of God is, in the Old Testament, always connected with his covenant relation to his people as a nation (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). Our <span class="accented">Lord</span> here is not thinking of the original relation of God to being and especially to humanity, in virtue of man's creation in the Divine image (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>), but of the relation into which the disciples have entered through the revelation of God in Christ; cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a> (Add. Note) and on <a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a> (Add. Note); also Weiss, 'Life,' 2:348. The phrase, which occurs here for the first time in St. Matthew (but cf. ver. 9, note), henceforth occurs frequently, becoming of great importance for this Gospel (cf. vers. 45, 48; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 9</a>, etc.).

In both cases the tendency of the new teaching (<a href="../../par/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>) to abolish temporary forms was perceived by at least those whose powers of perception were quickened through their opposition. <span class="cmt_word">That I am come</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">that I came</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Our Lord, both here and in the next clause, lays stress on his coming as an historic fact. The primary reference is probably to his coming forth from private life (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>). Yet in his own mind there may have been a further allusion to his coming from above (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>; and further, <a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy</span>.

Alford), and being used because of the negative. Such a distribution, however, though it could not have been expressed in an affirmative sentence, has for its background the consciousness of a difference in the nature of these two chief components of the Old Testament.  Observe that the third part of the Hebrew Scriptures, "the (Holy) Writings" - of which 'Psalms' (<a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>) form the most characteristic portion - is omitted in this summary reference to the Old Testament. The reason may be either that of the three parts it was used less than the other two as a basis for doctrine and for rule of life, or that it was practically included in the Prophets (<a href="../../par/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>). The essential teaching of the Law may be distinguished from that of the Prophets by saying that, while the Law was the direct revelation of God's will as law for the people's daily life - personal, social, and national - the Prophets (including the historical books and the prophets proper) were rather the indirect revelation of his will for them under the fresh circumstances into which they came; this indirect revelation being seen more especially in God's providential guidance of the nation, and in his explanation of principles of worship, as well as in occasional predictions of the future. It is to his relation to the Prophets in this connexion, as an indirect revelation of God's will under changing circumstances (cf. Weiss) that our Lord here chiefly refers. For he is led to speak of his own relation to them from the bearing that this has on the conduct of his disciples. Many, however (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Chrysostom), consider that he is thinking of his relation to them as containing predictions concerning himself. In answer to this it is not sufficient to say (Meyer, Weiss, Alford) that it was impossible that Messiah could be thought to abrogate the Prophets; for, in fact, to many Jews during his ministry (even if not at this early stage of it), and much more to Jews at the time when the evangelist recorded the words, our Lord must have seemed to contradict the predictions about himself as they were then understood. It is indeed true that <span class="accented">the prima facie</span> ground that existed for thinking that our Lord's teaching was opposed, not merely to the religion of the day as dependent on the Law and the Prophets, but also to the predictions of Messiah contained in them, is enough to give a certain plausibility to this interpretation. But that is all. The absence in the context of any hint that he refers to his relation to predictions as such quite forbids our accepting it. It was probably derived solely from a misinterpretation of "ful<span class="accented">fil"</span> (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), no regard being paid to the train of thought by which our Lord was led to speak of the subject at all. Our Lord says that he is not come to "destroy" the Prophets as <span class="accented">exponents of the will of God. <span class="cmt_word"></span>I</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>am not come to destroy</span>; emphasizing his statement by repetition. <span class="cmt_word">But to fulfil</span>. By establishing the absolute and final meaning of the Law and the Prophets. Christ came not to abrogate the Law or the Prophets, but to satisfy them - to bring about in his own Person, and ultimately in the persons of his followers, that righteousness of life which, however limited by the historical conditions under which the Divine oracles had been delivered, was the sum and substance of their teaching. The fulfilment of the Law and the Prophets "is the perfect development of their ideal reality out of the positive form, in which the same is historically apprehended and limited" (Meyer). Martensen puts the matter thus: "How can he say that not a tittle shall pass from the Law, since the development of the Church shows us that the ceremonial law, that the whole Mosaic dispensation, has been annihilated by the influences proceeding from Christ? We answer: He has fulfilled the Law, whilst he has released it from the temporary forms in which its eternal validity was confined; he has unfolded its spiritual essence, its inward perfection. Not even a tittle of the ceremonial law has passed away, if we regard the Mosaic Law as a whole; for the ideas which form its basis, as the distinction between the unclean and the clean, are confirmed by Christ, and contained in the law of holiness which he teaches men" ('Christian Ethics: General,' &sect; 125); cf. ver. 18, notes, "till heaven and earth pass," "till all be fulfilled." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a></div><div class="verse">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Cf. <a href="../../par/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, "But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the Law to fail" (Revised Version). The words are so similar that the two evangelists probably record the same utterance, the difference in the form of the sentence pointing rather to an oral than a written common source. St. Luke places it in an attack on the Pharisees, who had scoffed at our Lord for his parable of the dishonest steward. <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>, literally, "established," "sure"). It has hardly been sufficiently noticed by commentators that the New Testament usage of the word "Amen" often slightly differs from that found in the Old Testament. "Amen" in the Old Testament always involves the personal acceptance of the statement to which it refers ("so be it"), whether this be a statement upon oath (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, perhaps), or a statement of penalties incurred under certain circumstances (<a href="../../par/numbers/5-22.htm">Numbers 5:22</a>, probably; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-13.htm">Nehemiah 5:13</a>); or a statement expressing a pious hope uttered either by another (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-36.htm">1 Kings 1:36</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a> (?); cf. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-6.htm">Nehemiah 8:6</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>); or by one's self (<a href="../../par/psalms/41-13.htm">Psalm 41:13</a>). Hence the LXX. either leaves it untranslated or, with but one exception, translates it by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. In Hellenistic Greek, however, it became often used as little more  than a mere asseveration ("verily"). The earliest trace of this usage is found in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>, where the LXX. renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5df;</span>by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (Aquila much better <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, though generally elsewhere <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), and it is frequent in the New Testament, cf. especially <a href="../../par/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, with parallels, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf. also <a href="../../par/luke/12-44.htm">Luke 12:44</a> with <a href="../../par/matthew/24-47.htm">Matthew 24:47</a>, and <a href="../../par/luke/21-3.htm">Luke 21:3</a> with <a href="../../par/mark/12-43.htm">Mark 12:43</a>). Yet this usage of "Amen" in Hellenistic Greek does not seem to have ever spread into Hebrew or Aramaic. W. H. Lowe ('Fragm. Pesach.,' p. 70) says, and apparently truly, "The Jews never used 'amen in the sense of 'verily.' They say <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">be'emeth</span>', 'in truth,' <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">hemanutha</span>, 'Faith!' or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span>, '<span class="accented">omnam</span>, 'verily.'" If so, the fact is interesting, for it implies that, notwithstanding the usage of "Amen" in Greek, our Lord himself, as speaking Aramaic, probably did not use it in the mere sense of strong asseveration, but rather always with its connotation of his entire concurrence in the statement he was making. In his mouth, that is to say, it always emphasized the thought of his personal acceptance of the statement with its legitimate issue. Observe that it makes no difference (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-6.htm">Jeremiah 28:6</a>) whether the "Amen" comes at the beginning or at the end of his utterance. N.B. - <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>) may be taken as intermediate between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> states a truth; <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> assents with the intellect; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, in at least Hebrew and Aramaic usage, accepts it with all its consequences (cf <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Till heaven and earth pass</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">pass away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>); and so in the next clause. The same almost archaic sense of "pass" recurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a>, Authorized Version (Revised Version, "pass away"). Observe that our Lord does not say that the Law will then pass away. He says, not till then; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he affirms, as in <a href="../../par/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>, that it is <span class="accented">easier</span> for heaven and earth to pass away than for the Law. For, in fact, as being constantly fulfilled in its ideal and therefore permanent character, it must necessarily remain in the new world; cf. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-25.htm">1 Peter 1:25</a> (the everlasting duration of the word of the Lord); <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> (love); <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a> (righteousness); cf. Meyer. The belief in the permanence of the Law which the Jews had (<span class="accented">vide</span> references in Meyer, and especially Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect;&sect; 5, 84) here finds its true satisfaction. "The least element of holiness which the Law contains has more reality and durability than the whole visible universe" (Godet on Luke). Comp. also <a href="../../par/mark/13-31.htm">Mark 13:31</a>, "My words shall not pass away" - a claim only seen in its full three when put beside these words about the Law. <span class="cmt_word">One jot</span>.

Observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mention of <span class="accented">yod</span>, evidently because of its small size, is one proof of the fact that the Hebrew characters in use in our Lord's time were much more similar to the usual form under which we know them (<span class="accented">Quadrate schrift</span>) than to the form found on the Moabite Stone (Phoenician), where the <span class="accented">god</span> is no smaller than other letters (<span class="accented">vide</span> Euting's very complete table of forms of the Hebrew alphabet in Chwolsen, 'Corp.

Weber, 'Altsynag. Theol.,' &sect; 27, 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and the article on Akiba in 'Dict. of Christian Biogr.'). If it be objected that our Lord could hardly refer to these marks of traditional explanation as of such permanence, the answer is that in so far as these expressed legitimate issues (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>, ver. 21) of the Mosaic Law, he could place them on the same level as that Law itself. <span class="cmt_word">Till all</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">till all things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all things in the Law - all the requirements of the Law, in contrast to the one "jot" or "tittle" just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Till all be fulfilled</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">be accomplished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The clause is probably epexegetical of "till heaven and earth pass away." Nothing in the Law shall pass away till heaven and earth pass away, when, with a new heaven and earth, all the contents of the Law will be completely realized (cf. Nosgen) so that even then nothing in the Law shall pass away (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>).

One of these least commandments.</span> Not necessarily such as the Pharisees reckoned least, in their enumeration of small and great, but such as our Lord himself symbolized by "jot" or "tittle;" those precepts which in reality are the least important (Meyer). Chrysostom strangely says that our Lord here refers, not to old laws, but to those which he was about to lay down; similarly Bengel thinks of vers. 22-28, etc. While the Jews distinguished carefully between small and great precepts, they insisted on the importance of keeping even the smallest; cf. 'Ab.,' 4:5 (Taylor), "Hasten to a slight precept.., for the reward of precept is precept." <span class="cmt_word">And shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">teach men so.</span> Doing his best to abrogate it, not only in his own person by neglect or violation, but also for others by teaching them to disregard it. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be called the least</span>. The Revised Version omits "he, .... the." He is not cast out of the kingdom ("Ubi nisi magni esse non possunt," Augustine), but his want of moral insight (did he consider it "breadth of thought"?) leads to his being called <span class="accented">least</span> in the kingdom. It is the converse of the parable in <a href="../../par/luke/19-17.htm">Luke 19:17</a>, etc. There faithfulness in a very little (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>) wins much; here disregard of a very little causes a person to be reckoned (ver. 9, note) as very little - the principle of judgment being that of <a href="../../par/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, "He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in avery little is unrighteous also in much." <span class="cmt_word">In the kingdom of heaven</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably in its full and final establishment.

Similarly the Revised Version; but rather supply "it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that which is required in the smallest commandment" (Meyer). The personal performance and conscious spreading of one of the least commandments will be found to involve so much that it gains for the person a high position. <span class="cmt_word">Do and teach</span>.

Why inserted here and not in the previous clause? Partly because of the awkwardness of inserting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there so soon after <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>; partly because our Lord wished to lay stress there on the recompense, here on the person ("he and no other") who receives recompense. On the thought, cf. 'Test. XII. Parr.' (Levi., &sect; 13), "If he teach these things and practise them, he shall share the throne of the king, as also Joseph our brother." It is worth adding Tyndale's remark in his 'Exposition,' "Whosoever shall first fulfil them  [these least commandments following] himself, and then teach other, and set all his study to the furtherance and maintaining of them, that doctor shall all they of the kingdom of heaven have in price, and follow him and seek him out, as doth an eagle her prey, and cleave to him as burrs." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed <i>the righteousness</i> of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Matthew only. The verse from "except" to the end is quoted verbally in Justin Martyr ('Trypho,' &sect; 105), as being in "the Memoirs." <span class="cmt_word">For I say</span>. So far from you my disciples (ver. 13) being right in despising any of the commands contained in the Law, they are all to be specially honoured by you; <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="cmt_word">your righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the righteousness you show in observing them; there is no thought here of the imputed righteousness of Christ) must far exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees; otherwise there is no entrance for you into the kingdom of heaven. But wherein lay the superiority of the righteousness which the disciples were to have? Did our Lord mean that his disciples were to painfully toil through the various enactments, ceremonial and other, of the Law as the scribes and Pharisees did, only with more serious and earnest purpose than they? That were in the case of many scribes and Pharisees hardly possible. For notwithstanding our Lord's occasional denunciations, many of them were men of the severest earnestness and the deepest conscientiousness, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Gamaliel and Saul of Tarsus. Our Lord must refer to the Law otherwise than as a system of enactments. His thought is similar to that of his words addressed to Nicodemus (<a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>), where he says that change of heart evidenced by public profession (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/10-10.htm">Romans 10:10</a>) is necessary for entrance into the kingdom of God (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8</a>). So here; while the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, even when joined to earnestness of purpose, nevertheless consists in the observance of external rules, there is a higher principle in the Law, by observing which a higher righteousness can be attained. Christ points, that is to say, away from the Law as a system of external rules to the Law in its deeper meaning, affecting the relation of the heart to God (cf. further Weiss, 'Life,' 2:147). <span class="cmt_word">Shall exceed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall abound still more than.</span> The statement is not merely comparative, but implies an abundance (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:10</a>)even in the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.

A much stronger statement than that of ver. 19, though some would identify the two. There Christ was comparing one disciple with another; here his disciples with non-disciples. "Such a relaxing for yourselves and others of the commandments will <span class="accented">set you low</span> in the true kingdom of obedience and holiness; but this of having a righteousness so utterly false and hollow as that of the scribes and Pharisees will not merely set you low, but will exclude you from that kingdom altogether (ver. 20); for while that marks an <span class="accented">impaired</span> spiritual vision, this marks a vision utterly darkened and destroyed" (Trench, ' Sermon on the Mount'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-48.</span> - (<span class="accented">a</span>) Our Lord is still concerned with the relation of himself and his followers to the religion of the day, of which the Old Testament (ver. 17), and more especially the Law (ver. 18), was the accepted standard. But after having spoken of the need of careful attention to (vers. 17,18), and observance of (ver. 19), even the least commands of the Law, he goes on to point out the far-reaching character of these commands, whether they are such as we should call more (vers. 21, 27, 81) or less (vers. 33, 38, 43) impotent. It is essential to notice that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> refers to these commands, not merely as statements contained in the Law, but as part of the religion of the day, and that he contrasts their true bearing on life and conduct with that false bearing on this which was commonly predicated of them. By this it is not meant that our Lord was only opposing such narrow glosses and interpretations as had arisen at various times during the centuries after the promulgation of the Law (for these were for the most part perfectly natural and legitimate developments of the earliest possible interpretations of it), still less that he was thinking only of the worst of the misrepresentations of its commands, comparatively recently made by the Pharisees; but  that he was now going back, beyond this so far natural and normal development of the earliest interpretations, to the first principles underlying the revelation contained in the Law. While the Jews, not unnaturally, clung to the primary, but temporary, meaning of the Law as a revelation of God's will for them as a nation, our Lord was now about to expound its commands as a revelation of God's permanent will for them and all men as men. Our Lord was now, that is to say, wishing to do more than merely cut off the excrescences that, chiefly through the Pharisaic party, had grown up round the Law, but less than root up the Law itself. He rather cuts down the whole growth that had been, notwithstanding some mere excrescences, the right and proper outcome of the Law in its original environment, in order that, in fresh environment, which corresponded better to its nature, the Law might produce a growth still more right and proper. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-26.</span> - <span class="accented">The sixth commandment.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24</span> Matthew only; vers. 25, 26 have parts common to Luke. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, frequentative aorist). Our Lord does not say, "ye have read" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>), for he was not now speaking to the learned classes, but to a large audience many of whom were probably unable to read. "Ye have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from your teachers whose teaching claims to be the substance of the Law. So, probably, even in <a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>, where the multitude say that they "have heard out of the Law that the Christ abideth for ever," which, since this is hardly expressed in so many words in the Old Testament, must mean that the instructions they have received on this subject truly represent the substance of its teaching. So here our Lord says, "You have heard from your teachers (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>) that the substance of the sixth commandment is so-and-so." It is thus quite intelligible that in some of these utterances there should be found added to (vers. 21, 43) or intermingled with (ver. 33) the words of a passage of Scripture, other words which are <span class="accented">either</span> taken from Scripture, but from another place in it (perhaps ver. 33), or do not occur in Scripture at all, but merely help to form a compendious statement of a definite interpretation (here and ver. 43). It must remain doubtful whether our Lord himself formulated these statements of the popular teaching, or quoted them verbally as current. If the latter, as is perhaps more likely, there remains the at present still more insoluble question whether they were only oral or (cf. the case of the 'Didaehe') had already been committed to writing (cf. in this connexion Bishop Westcott, 'Hebr.,' p. 480). <span class="cmt_word">That it was said by them of old time</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">.

Christ brings his own Personality forward, and claims to give a more perfect and far-reaching statement of the sixth commandment than the current form of its  teaching, notwithstanding the fact that this current form represented truly the original thought underlying its promulgation. In the following words our Lord speaks of three grades of auger, and, as answering to them, of three grades of punishment. The former will be examined under the several terms employed. Upon the latter it is necessary to make a few remarks here. They have been very variously understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" means the judgment of God alone, for he alone can take cognizance of mere anger; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council" means the judgment of the Sanhedrin, "a publick tryal;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" means the judgment of hell (Lightfoot, 'Hor.

It will be noticed that both the above interpretations are inconsistent. They make our Lord pass from literal to figurative language in the same sentence. Besides, in the second it is inexplicable how mere anger could be brought under the cognizance of a human court. For these reasons it is probable that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> all three stages express metaphorically grades of Divine judgment under the form of the Jewish processes of law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "The judgment" primarily means the local court; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> "the council "primarily means the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> "the Gehenna of fire" primarily means the Valley of Hinnom, where the last processes of judgment seem to have taken place (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Christ does not say that the sins spoken of render a man liable to any of these earthly processes of law; he says that they render him liable to processes of Divine law which are fittingly symbolized by these expressions. (So Alford, Mansel, and especially Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount,' p. 190). <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever is angry</span>; Revised Version, more precisely, every one who (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This form of expression is specially frequent in 1 John, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> 3:3, where Bishop Westcott says, "In each case where this characteristic form of language occurs there is apparently a reference to some who had questioned the application of a general principle in particular cases," (For the thought of this clause, cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">With his brother.</span> The term "brother" was applied in both Greek and Hebrew, by way of metaphor, to things that possessed merely such fellowship as arises from juxtaposition or from similarity of purpose (cf. of the cherubim, <a href="../../par/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>, "with their faces one to another," literally, "each (man) to his brother"). It is thus possible that here the thought is of any person with whom one is brought into temporary relation, quite apart from any question of a common source. Yet as this could have been represented by "neighbour" (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a>), it seems reasonable to see something more in "brother," and to view it with reference to its implied meaning, "fellowship of life based on identity of origin" (Cremer). To Jews as such the term would doubtless only suggest identity of origin nationally, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fellow-Jew (cf. especially <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>a with 16, 17b, 18; so even <a href="../../par/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>); but to Christians of the time when the Gospel was written rather identity of spiritual origin, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a fellow-Christian. Probably when the expression fell from Christ's lips not one of those who heard him imagined that it could have any wider meaning than fellow-Jew or fellow-believer on Jesus, and probably most of them limited it to the former. In fact, Christ seems to have used it as a means whereby to lead up his hearers from the idea of a national to that of a spiritual relation (cf. vers. 47, 48). We are therefore hardly warranted (far-reaching as the word on Christ's lips is) in seeing here any reference to the thought of the universal brotherhood of man, based on the fact of all being children of one common Father (cf. further Bishop Westcott, on <a href="../../par/1_john/2-9.htm">1 John 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Without a</span> <span class="cmt_word">cause</span>.

There is a holy anger, but that is with a brother's sin, not with the brother himself (cf. Augustine, in Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be in danger of the judgment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God's wrath as symbolized by the lowest degree of Jewish trial (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And whosoever</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>).

Buxtorf, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>, compares a favourite expression of Aben Ezra's, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, "empty-heads," for those who raise senseless objections, etc.; but the simple expression in our text refers rather to moral deficiency thorn to deficiency of brain. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">council</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>But</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and.</span> The Authorized Version interpolates an emphasis on the climax. <span class="cmt_word">Thou fool</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> This is probably the Greek word for "fool," equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">nabal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>), which was often used in the Old Testament of the folly of wickedness (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>). In this sense <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used by our Lord himself (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-17.htm">Matthew 23:17</a> [19]). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It may be the transliteration (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5db;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) of the Hebrew <span class="accented">moreh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>), "rebel" (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10</a>). (So Revised Version margin, Weiss. Nosgen.) In favour of this is the parallelism cf. language with <span class="accented">Raca.</span> The sense, too, is excellent, "Thou rebel against God!" It is almost equivalent to "Apostate!" But the absence of any evidence that the Jews used <span class="accented">moreh</span> as a term of abuse prevents our accepting this interpretation. Field ('Otium Norv.,' 3.) points out that if this interpretation were true, <span class="accented">moreh</span> would be "the <span class="accented">only</span> pure Hebrew word in the Greek Testament (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;</span>, as being taken from the LXX., belong to a different class), all other foreign words being indisputably Aramaic, as <span class="accented">raca</span>, <span class="accented">talitha kumi</span>, <span class="accented">maranatha</span>, etc., which, as might have been expected, are retained by the authors of the Syriac versions without alteration.

In either case. the term expresses the absolute godlessness of him who is so addressed. Of the two terms, <span class="accented">Raca</span> is more negative, implying the absence of all good, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;</span> more positive, implying decided wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be in danger of</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. The change from the usual dative to the unique construction with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, indicated by the Revised Version margin, "Greek, unto or into," is doubtless because our Lord no longer refers to the tribunal at which the punishment is ordered, but to the punishment itself into which the condemned man comes (cf. Wirier, &sect; 31:5). <span class="cmt_word">Hell fire</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the hell of fire</span>; Revised Version margin, "Greek, Gehenna of fire" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Gehenna is properly "the Valley of Hinnom" (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-16.htm">Joshua 18:16</a>b; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), or "of the son of Hinnom" (Joshuaxv. 8; 16:18a; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). It is probably the valley on the south-west of Jerusalem (see, however, W. F. Birch, in Palestine Exploration Fund Report, January, 1889, pp. 39, 42, who places it between the two parts of Jerusalem, identifying it with the Tyropoeon Valley of Josephus, neglecting, however, to explain how so central a position is consistent with the "fire." In it was the spot where human sacrifices were offered to Moloch (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>; and Rawlinson, on <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>), called the Topheth, "the place of horror" (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Payne Smith, on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>); and in it, presumably on the same place, were burnt, according to Jewish tradition (<span class="accented">vide</span> especially Kimchi, on <a href="../../par/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>), the carcases of animals and other offal. There is no direct evidence that the bodies of criminals (as is often stated) were burnt there. But it seems probable that it was in this place that death by "burning," whether it was the later method of "burning" by a red-hot wire, or the earlier (Mishna, 'San-hedr.,' 7:2) of lighting faggots of wood round the condemned person, would be carried into effect. Thus both from the old associations of the valley, and from the then use made of it, the epithet "of fire" would be very naturally added. It seems probable that our Lord here referred primarily to "Gehenna" in this local sense (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), but it is fair to notice that there is no other instance in the New Testament of this literal usage of the word. Elsewhere it is always in the metaphorical sense common in rabbinic writings of the place of final punishment which we usually call "hell."

Seeing that the consequences of an angry spirit are so terrible. For there is no thought here of an unforgiving spirit spoiling the acceptance of the gift (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>).

Christ implies that the action has already begun. <span class="cmt_word">Thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">gift</span>; a general word for any sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">To the altar</span>. Since those to whom he spoke were still Jews, Christ illustrates his meaning by  Jewish practices. A perverse literalism has found here a direct reference to the Eucharist. For reasonable <span class="accented">adaptations</span> (cf. even in ' Didache,' &sect; 14.) of these two verses to this, see Waterland, 'Doctrine of the Eucharist,' ch. 13. &sect; 4 (pp. 359-362, Oxford, 1868). <span class="cmt_word">And there rememberest</span>, etc. For the spirit of recollection may well culminate with the culminating action. Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.') shows that even the Jews taught such a postponement of the sacrifice if theft was remembered. He therefore thinks that the stress is on "ought" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>): "For that which the <span class="accented">Jews</span> restrained only to pecuniary damages, Christ extends to all offences against our brother." But he overlooks the fact that, while the Jewish precept had reference to a sin (or even the neglect of some ceremonial rule, cf.

The question of the relation of the two passages, as regards both language and original connexion, is exceedingly difficult. As to the former, the verbal differences seem to be such as would hardly have been made on purpose, and to be rather due to memory; yet the agreement is too minute to be the result of memory of a Gospel only oral. Perhaps memory of a document best satisfies the conditions. As to the original connexion of the verses, they, especially ver. 26, can hardly have been spoken twice. Most critics suppose that St. Luke gives them in their proper context; but if so, it is curious that two of his words, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, seem to recall our preceding ver. 24. One word might have been a mere coincidence, but hardly two. It is not likely that these words in ver. 24 were derived from <span class="accented">Luke</span>, for this <span class="accented">supposes</span> a double process in St. Matthew's mind, rejecting them from ver. 25 and placing them in ver. 24. It is more natural also to regard the first clause of <a href="../../par/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, "As...  him," as an expansion of the corresponding clause in our ver. 25 rather than this as a compression of that. This apparent reminiscence in Luke of what is given in our vers. 24 and 25a points to the connexion of vers. 24-26 in Matthew being original, and to it having been broken by Luke or by the framer of the source that he used. A further stage in our Lord's warning. A man must not only seek reconciliation with the injured person (ver. 23), and that in preference to fulfilling the holiest service (ver. 24), but he must do so the more because of the danger of postponing reconciliation. It is noteworthy that our Lord in this verse does not define on whose side the cause of the quarrel lies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Agree with</span>. And that not with a merely formal reconciliation, but reconciliation based on a permanent kindly feeling towards him (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>).

The element of mercy can enter up to a certain point of time, but after that only justice.

But it should not be forgotten that, in the parallel passage in Luke, the reference is to God. Offences against man are there represented in their true character as offences against God, who is therefore depicted as the adversary in a lawsuit. That, from another point of view, be is also the Judge, matters not. Both conceptions of him are true, and can be kept quite distinct.

Yet, as St. Augustine points out, St. Paul took oaths in his writings (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>); and our Lord himself did not refuse to answer when put upon his oath (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63, 64</a>). He, that is to say, and St. Paul after him, accepted the fact that there are times when a solemn oath must be taken. How, then, can we explain this absolute prohibition here? In that our Lord is not here thinking at all of formal and solemn oaths, but of oaths as the outcome of impatience and exaggeration. The thoughtlessness of fervent asseveration is often betrayed into an oath. Such an oath, or even any asseveration that passes in spirit beyond "yea, yea," "nay, nay," has its origin <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; cf. Chaucer, "Sweryng sodeynly without avysement is eek a gret synne" ('Parson's Tale,' &sect; 'De Ira'). Martensen, however ('Ethics, Individual,' &sect; 100), takes the prohibition of oaths as formally unconditional and total, in accordance with the highest ideal of what man will hereafter be and require, and he sees the limitation, which he allows is to be given to these words, in the present conditions of human society. We have an ideal duty towards God, but we have also a practical duty to those among whom we live, and the present state of human affairs permits and necessitates oaths. Hence it was that even Christ submitted to them. <span class="cmt_word">Neither by heaven</span>, etc. Our Lord further defines what he means by an oath. It does not mean only an expression in which God's Name is mentioned, but any expression appealing to any object at all, whether this be supraterrestrial, terrestrial, national, or personal. Although God's Name is often omitted in such cases, from a feeling of reverence, its omission does not prevent the asseveration being an oath. <span class="accented">Heaven</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the heaven</span>; for the thought is clearly not the immaterial transcendental heaven, the abode of bliss, but the physical heaven (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">Heaven...  footstool</span>. Adapted from <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-1.htm">Isaiah 66:1</a>, where it forms part of the glorious declaration that no material temple can contain God, that "the Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands" as St. Stephen paraphrases it (<a href="../../par/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48</a>).

"These last two antitheses, which terminate in Matthew in the lofty thought (ver. 48) of man being elevated by love to the perfection of God, furnish Luke with the leading idea of the discourse as he presents it, namely, charity as the law of the new life." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - <span class="accented">The reception of injuries. </span> The Law inculcated that the injured should obtain from those who did the wrong exact compensation (on this being properly a command, not merely a permission, <span class="accented">vide</span> Mozley, 'Ruling Ideas,' etc., pp. 182, sqq.). Our Lord inculcates giving up of all in-sistance upon one's rights as an injured person, and entire submission to injuries, even as far as proffering the opportunity for fresh wrongs. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</span>. No short phrase could more accurately describe the spirit of the Mosaic legislation. Offences against individuals were to be punished by the injured individual receiving back, as it were, the exact compensation from him who had injured him. While this was originally observed literally, it was in Mishnic times (and probably in the time of our Lord) softened to payment of money (<span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). The phrase comes three times in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). Notice: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The LXX. has the accusative in each case, although only in the first does a verb precede. Probably the expression had already become proverbial in Greek even before the translation of the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Hebrew of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> is slightly different from that of the other two passages, and as the preposition there used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>) is not so necessarily rendered by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, that passage is perhaps the least likely of the three to have been in our Lord's mind now. It seems likely, however, that he was not thinking of any one of the three passages in particular. The words served him as a summary of the Law in this respect.

Nor did St. Paul (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-35.htm">Acts 16:35</a><span class="accented">ff</span>; Acts 22:25; 23:3; 25:9,10).

"This offering of the other cheek <span class="accented">may</span> be done outwardly; but only inwardly can it be always right" (Trench, 'Sermon on the Mount'). We must further remember the distinction brought out here by Luther between what the Christian has to do as a Christian, and what he has to do as, perhaps an official, member of the state. The Lord leaves to the state its own jurisdiction (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-21.htm">Matthew 22:21</a>: <span class="accented">vide</span> Meyer). <span class="accented">That ye resist not</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">resist not</span>, thus avoiding all possibility of the English reader taking the words as a statement of fact. <span class="accented">Evil</span>.

From the Persian. Hatch ('Essays,' p. 37) shows that while the classical usage strictly refers to the Persian system or' mounted couriers (described in Herod., 8:98; Xen., 'Cyr.,' 8:6. 17), the post-classical usage refers to the later development of a system, not of postal service, but of the forced transport of military baggage. It thus indicates, not merely  forced attendance, but forced carrying. Hence it is used in <a href="../../par/matthew/27-32.htm">Matthew 27:32</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/15-21.htm">Mark 15:21</a> of Simon the Cyrenian, "who was pressed by the Roman soldiers who were escorting our Lord not merely to accompany them but also to carry a load." Thus here also the thought is doubtless that of being compelled to carry baggage. There may also be a reference, as Hatch suggests, to the oppressive conduct of the Roman soldiers (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>). (For the spirit of our Lord's saying, <span class="accented">vide</span> also 'Aboth,' 3:18 (Taylor), where the probable translation is, "Rabbi Ishmael said, Be pliant of disposition and <span class="accented">yielding to impressment."</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>A mile</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">one mile</span>; but see <a href="../../par/matthew/8-19.htm">Matthew 8:19</a>, note.

The connexion is as follows: Our Lord spoke first (ver. 39) of entire submission to injuries; then (ver. 40) of acceptance of loss of property; then (ver. 41) of acceptance of a burden imposed; here of acceptance of a demand for pecuniary assistance. This, in its turn, forms an easy transition to the subject of ver. 43, <span class="accented">sqq. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Give to him that asketh thee</span>, etc. This verse has been often adduced by unbelievers to prove the incompatibility of our Lord's utterances with the conditions of modern society. Wrongly. Because our Lord is inculcating the proper spirit of Christian life, not giving rules to be literally carried out irrespective of circumstances. Hammond (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ford) points out that we have "a countermand" in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:7, 10</a>. (For the possibility of accounting for the verbal differences between this verse and <a href="../../par/luke/6-30.htm">Luke 6:30</a> by supposing an Aramaic original, see Professor Marshall, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1891, p. 287.)

Our Lord now turns from the reception of injuries to the treatment of those who injure us. We are not to injure them in return, nor merely to keep aloof from them, but to show them positive kindness. The Law, in the natural development of it current at the time, taught very differently. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span>. - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have heard</span> (ver. 21, note). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy</span>. The first clause is found in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, the second is the natural, and, from one point of view, legitimate, deduction from it. "The whole precept, as it stands, undoubtedly represents, and is a summary of, the sense of the Law" (Mozley, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>). The meaning of the words "neighbour" and "enemy" has been much discussed. In Leviticus, indeed, the meaning of "neighbour" is clear; it answers to "the children of thy people" in the preceding clause, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it refers to members of the nation; all Israelites are termed "neighbours." The primary sense, therefore, of this whole precept is love to an Israelite, hatred to a non-Israelite (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). As such, the precept was of value in cementing the unity of the nation and preventing greater exposure to the evils, moral and religious, found outside it. But as quoted by our Lord, it has evidently a more private reference. He treats the precept as referring to personal friends (those who act in a neighbourly way) and enemies, and even this is, in some respects, a legitimate summary of the teaching of the Law, in so far as it forms another side of the law of retaliation. In days when public justice was weak much had to be left to the action of the individual, and he who was wronged was bid satisfy justice by retaliating on his enemy. That, however, it was not the only teaching of the Law is evident from <a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>). But as regards both aspects of the precept the time had come for a change. The Jews only too gladly showed obedience to the second part of the precept, making themselves proverbial (cf. Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:5. 2; Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:103) for their more than incivility to Gentiles, and they seem to have also zealously carried it out towards their personal enemies (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/109.htm">Psalm 109</a>.). On the whole subject, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Mozley ('Ruling Ideas,' pp. 188-200), who, however, hardly allows enough weight to passages like <a href="../../par/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a>.

If we may lay stress on the Greek, our Lord expresses the popular notion of the sun ascending. It must, however, be remembered that the word he himself probably used was <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;</span> in hiph.

Notice how, by chiasm, the emphasis is laid on the ungodly alike at the beginning and at the end. Our Lord here brings out God's active love as seen in nature, nourishing and maintaining men, irrespective of the qualities of individuals and of their treatment of him and his laws.

To this short description little need be added. The Roman system of taxation was to put up the country, or certain productions of the country, at auction, and to "sell" them to any who would undertake to pay the greatest amount of revenue from them (cf. also Josephus's account of the Egyptian method,  <span class="date">B.C. 250</span>, 'Ant.,' 12:04. 4; and Sayce's article in the <span class="accented">Jewish Quarterly</span>, July, 1890, on a Jewish taxgatherer at Thebes,  <span class="date">B.C. 140</span>). This contract was in turn divided and subdivided, those who actually drew the money from the people being generally natives. It thus being the interest of every contractor and sub-contractor to squeeze as much as possible from those under him, the whole system was demoralizing to all engaged in it. In the case of Judaea it was especially so, as there was a strong feeling among religious Jews against the lawfulness of paying taxes to a Gentile ruler (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17</a>, note). It is no wonder, therefore, that we find the native collectors (even of districts where the money raised went to Antipas's treasury, <a href="../../par/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>, note) classed with "harlots" (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-31.htm">Matthew 21:31</a>), "sinners" (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-11.htm">Matthew 9:11</a>), the heathen (ver. 4:7; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>).

While the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> emphasizes the contrast between Christ's disciples and those who  followed the usual deduction from the Law, the position of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (reversing that of Deuteronomy) shows that still greater emphasis is placed on their "perfection" as something to be attained. Also, while in the parallel passage of Luke the stress is upon the change that must take place (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>)  - unless, as is possible, it has the simple meaning "show yourselves" (cf. ver. 45, note) - in Matthew the possibility or even the certainty of attaining it is definitely stated. You shall make this your aim, and shall attain to it. <span class="accented">Therefore.</span> A deduction from the principle laid down in vers. 44-47. From the consideration of the example of your Father, and of the insufficiency of being like publicans and heathen. <span class="accented">Perfect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). In the Gospels here and <a href="../../par/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a> only. The word denotes those who have attained the full development of innate powers, in contrast to those who are still in the undeveloped state - adults in contrast to children. Thus the thought here is - Ye shall be satisfied with, and shall attain to, no lower state than that of maturity. But what is it as to which they shall be mature? Surely not the whole Law as illustrated by all the examples since ver. 21; for vers. 31, 32 are excluded by the comparison with God immediately following. It must be the subject with which the sentence is closely connected, vers. 44-47 (cf. Meyer); love to others even though they have done you wrong. In this respect, viz. love to others, you shall admit, says our Lord, no lower ideal than that of' maturity, even such maturity as is found in him who sends sun and rain on all alike. Some (Augustine, Trench) have seen in this a merely relative maturity, itself capable of further development; but the subject rather demands absolute and final maturity. This does not imply that man will ever have such fulness of love as the Father has, but that he will fully and completely attain to that measure of love to which he as a created being was intended to attain. It may, however, be in accordance with true exegesis to see, with Weiss, for such apparently is his meaning, also an indication of further teaching - the nature of the revelation made known by Christ. For whereas "the fundamental commandment" of the Old Testament, "Ye shall be holy; for I am holy" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44, 45</a>), was the more negative thought of God's exaltation above the impurity of created beings, our Lord now puts forth "the positive conception of the Divine perfection, whose nature is all-embracing, self-sacrificing love. And in place of the God, for ever separated from his polluted people by his holiness, to whom they can only render themselves worthy of approach through the most anxious abstinence from all impurity, and by means of the statutes for purification contained in the Law, there is on the ground of this new revelation the Father in heaven, who stoops to his children in love, and so operates that they must and can be like him" (Weiss, 'Life,' 2:156). The simple and straightforward meaning of the verse, however, is this - You shall take no lower standard in love to enemies than God shows to those who ill treat him, and you shall, in fact, attain to this standard. Upon this (for the limitation of the meaning to one point makes no real difference) there arises the question which has been of so much importance in all ages of the Church - What is the measure of attainment that is really possible for Christ's disciples upon earth? ought they not to expect to live perfect lives? But the text gives no warrant for such an assertion. No doubt it says that attainment to maturity - to perfection according to creaturely limits <span class="cmt_word">-</span> is eventually possible. That is implied in <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). But <span class="accented">when</span> this attainment can be made is not stated. Many will, indeed, affirm that, as our Lord is giving directions to his disciples concerning things in this life, the attainment also is affirmed to be possible in this life. But this by no means follows. Christ gives the command, and by the form of it implies that it shall be carried out to the full. But this is quite consistent with the conception of a gradually increasing development of love which, in fact will attain maturity, a state in which God's love has ever been; but not immediately and not before the final completion of all Christ's work in us. The words form, indeed, a promise as well as a command, but the absence of a statement of time forbids us to claim the verse as a warrant for asserting that the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> referred to can be attained in this life. Trench ('Syr.,' &sect; 22.) explains the passage by saying that the adjective is used the first time in a relative, and the second time in an absolute, sense. But this does not seem as probable as the interpretation given above, according to which the adjective is in both cases used absolutely. His following words, however, deserve careful attention. "The Christian shall be ' perfect,' yet not in the sense in which some of the sects preach the doctrine of perfection, who, so soon as their words are looked into, are found either to mean nothing which they could not have expressed by a word less liable to misunderstanding; or to mean something which no man in this life shall attain, and which he who affirms he has attained is deceiving himself, or others, or both." <span class="cmt_word">Even as your Father which is</span> in <span class="cmt_word">heaven is perfect;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">as your heavenly Father is perfect</span>; so the manuscripts. The epithet, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is wanting  in Luke, but Matthew wishes to lay stress on their Father's character and methods being different from those of an earthly father. Observe again not "the Father" but your Father; nerving them to fulfil the summons to likeness to him (cf. ver. 16). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../matthew/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Matthew 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Matthew 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../matthew/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Matthew 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Matthew 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
