Given a question as to what is right or wrong in a particular instance, he always aims at laying down some great eternal fact to which the duty or decision is ultimately referable, and deduces the required rule from that fact. The headship of Christ is stated in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>; and its application to the superiority of man is laid down also in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>. The subordinate position of the woman is also stated in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1, 5, 6</a>, etc. This, however, is merely an ordinance of earthly application. In the spiritual realm "there is neither male nor female" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The head of the woman is the man.</span> In Christ the distinctions of the sexes are done away. It was, perhaps, an abuse of this principle which had led the Corinthian women to assert themselves and their rights more prominently than decorum warranted. <span class="cmt_word">The head of Christ is God.</span> That Christ is "inferior to the Father as touching his manhood," that his mediatorial kingdom involves (so far) a subordination of his coequal Godhead, has been already stated in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>, and is further found in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27, 28</a>.

The Jewish worshipper in praying always covers his head with his <span class="accented">tallith.</span> The Jew (like Orientals generally) uncovered his feet because the place on which he stood was holy ground; but he covered his head by way of humility, even as the angels veil their faces with their wings. AEneas is said by Servius to have introduced this custom into Italy. On the other hand, the Greek custom was to pray with the head uncovered. St. Paul - as some discrepancy of custom seems to have arisen - decided in favour of the Greek custom, on the high ground that Christ, by his incarnation, became man, and therefore the Christian, who is" in Christ," may stand with unveiled head in the presence of his Father<span class="cmt_word">. Dishonoureth his head</span>. He dishonoureth his own head, which is as it were a sharer in the glory of Christ, who is Head of the whole Church. "We pray," says Tertullian, "with bare heads because we blush not." The Christian, being no longer a slave, but a son (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>), may claim his part in the glory of the eternal Son. The head was covered in <span class="accented">mourning</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>), and the worship of the Christian is joyous.

See the case of Philip's daughters (<a href="../../par/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a> and Acts 2:17). <span class="cmt_word">With her head uncovered</span>. For a woman to do this in a public assembly was against the national custom of all ancient communities, and might lead to the gravest misconceptions. As a rule, modest women covered their heads with the <span class="accented">peplum</span> or with a veil when they worshipped or were in public. Christian women at Corinth must have caught something of the "inflation" which was characteristic of their Church before they could have acted with such reprehensible boldness as to adopt a custom identified with the character of immodest women. <span class="cmt_word">Dishonoureth her head.</span> Calvin, with terse good sense, observes, "As the man honours his head by proclaiming his liberty, so the woman by acknowledging her subjection."

To be shorn or shaven was a sign of mourning (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12</a>), and was a disgrace inflicted on adulteresses.

Under this head must be classed the idle attempts to twist the word <span class="accented">exousia</span>, power, or authority, into some other reading - an attempt which may be set aside, because it is not sanctioned by a single manuscript. We may also dismiss the futile efforts to make <span class="accented">exousia</span> have any other primary meaning than "authority." The <span class="accented">context</span> shows that the word has here a <span class="accented">secondary</span> sense, and implies <span class="accented">some kind of covering.</span> The verse, therefore, points the same lessons as <a href="../../par/genesis/24-64.htm">Genesis 24:64, 65</a>. This much may be regarded as certain, and this view is adopted by the steadfast good sense of our English translators, both in the Authorized and Revised Versions. The only question worth asking is <span class="accented">why</span> the word <span class="accented">exousia</span> had come at Corinth, or in the Corinthian Church, to be used for "a veil," or "covering." The simplest answer is that just as the word "kingdom" in Greek may be used for "a crown" (comp. <span class="accented">regno</span> as the name of the pope's tiara), so "<span class="accented">authority"</span> may mean "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">sign of authority"</span> (Revised Version), or "a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband" (Authorized Version, margin). The margin of the Revised Version, "authority over her head," is a strange suggestion. Some have explained the word of <span class="accented">her own</span> true authority, which consists in accepting the rule of her husband; but it probably moans <span class="accented">a sign of her husband's authority over her.</span> Similarly the traveller Chardin says that in Persia the women wear a veil, in sign that they are "under subjection." If so, the best comment on the word may be found in the exquisite lines of Milton, which illustrate the passage in other ways also - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"She, as a vei1, down to the slender waist<br />Her unadorned golden tresses wore...<br />As the vine curves her tendrils, which implied<br />Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br />And by her yielded, by him best received."</span> The fact that Callistratus twice uses <span class="accented">exousia</span> of "abundance of hair" is probably a mere coincidence, resembling the Irish expression "a power of hair." Nor can there be any allusion to the isolated fact that Samson's strength lay in his hair. The very brief comment of Luther sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the subject. He says that <span class="accented">exousia</span> means "the veil or covering, by which one may see that she is under her husband's authority" (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of the angels.</span> In this clause also we must set aside, as idle waste of time, the attempts to alter the text, or to twist the plain words into impossible meanings. The word "angels" cannot mean "Church officials," or "holy men," or "prophets," or "delegates," or "'bridegroom's men," or anything but angels. Nor can the verse mean, as Bengel supposes, that women are to veil themselves because the angels do so (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>), or (as Augustine says) because the angels approve of it. The only question is whether the allusion is to good or bad angels. In favour of the latter view is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"></span> the universal tradition among the Jews that the angels fell by lust for mortal women, which was the Jewish way of interpreting <a href="../../par/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1, 2</a>. This is the view of Tertullian ('De Virg. Vel.,' 7) in writing on this subject. A woman, in the opinion and traditions of Oriental Jews, is liable to injury from the <span class="accented">shedim</span>, if she appears in public unveiled; and these evil spirits are supposed to delight in the appearance of unveiled women. The objection to this view, that <span class="accented">angeloi</span> alone is never used of evil but always of good angels, is not perhaps decisive (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>). The verse may, however, mean (in accordance with the Jewish belief of those days) that good angels, being under the possibility of falling from the same cause as their evil brethren, fly away at once from the presence of unveiled women. Thus Khadijah tested that the visitant of her husband Mohammed really was the angel Gabriel, because he disappeared the moment she unveiled her head. On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be, <span class="accented">out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always invisibly present in the Christian assemblies.</span> (On this point, see <a href="../../par/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a> [LXX.]; Tobit 12:12. See Latimer's 'Sermons,' p. 253). "Reverence the angels" is St. Chrysostom's remark.

(Meyer). Calvin says, "It is portentous that Satan should have accomplished so much in so short a time." But the remark was, perhaps, dictated by the wholly mistaken fancy that the Church of the apostolic days was exceptionally pure. On the contrary, many of the heathen converts were unable at once to break the spell of their old habits, and few modern Churches present a spectacle so deplorable as that which we here find in the apostolic Church of Corinth. It is quite obvious that Church discipline must have been almost in abeyance if such grave scandals could exist uncorrected and apparently unreproved.

But the commentators found it difficult to suppose that any of the Corinthians had not "houses to eat and to drink in." Hence most commentators give to the phrase its classic sense, in which "those who have" means the rich, and "those who have not," the poor. They seem, however, to have forgotten that slaves at any rate could hardly be said to have "houses of their own," and it is certain that not a few of the Corinthian Christians were slaves. <span class="cmt_word">I praise you not.</span> As in ver. 17, this is an instance of what is called <span class="accented">litotes</span>, a mild expression, suggesting a meaning much stronger than the words themselves. <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.

The terms in which he describes the institution of the Eucharist resemble most nearly those of St. Luke, who may very probably have derived his information from St. Paul. This passage should be compared with <a href="../../par/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26-29</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-22.htm">Mark 14:22-25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Was betrayed;</span> rather, <span class="accented">was being betrayed.</span>
