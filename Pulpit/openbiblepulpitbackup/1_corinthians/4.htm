Ministers are not to be unduly magnified, for their position is subordinate; they are not to be unduly depreciated, for if they are faithful they may appeal from frivolous human prejudices and careless depreciations to that only Judge and Master before whom they stand or fall. <span class="cmt_word">Ministers</span>; here <span class="accented">huperetas</span>; in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a> <span class="accented">diakonous.</span> They are <span class="accented">huperetai</span> (in its derivation "under rowers") in their relation to Christ; <span class="accented">diakonoi in</span> their relation to men. <span class="cmt_word">Of Christ;</span> and therefore responsible to Him. <span class="cmt_word">Stewards</span>; dispensers, subordinate distributors. These "agents" were higher slaves (<a href="../../par/luke/16-1.htm">Luke 16:1-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the mysteries of God</span>. The word "mysteries" means truths once hidden but now revealed; as in <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>, "Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God." In later patristic usage the word means "sacraments;" but St. Paul has expressly said (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>) that his mission was to preach the gospel, not primarily to administer the sacraments. (For descriptions of the work of a minister according to St. Paul's lofty ideal, see the pastoral Epistles, and <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7-11</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25-29</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-21, 24-28</a>. St. Peter's is given in <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>.) A minister is not to be estimated as a supernatural teacher, or a civil autocrat, or an infallible critic, but as an ambassador from Christ, who reveals to the "initiated" that which they could not otherwise know. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span>. The true reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F) is <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">here, moreover</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "on this earth." It may be required of him as a minister that he should be faithful, but if, being faithful, he is misjudged and depreciated, his appeal lies to a truer and loftier tribunal. <span class="cmt_word">It is required.</span> This is the reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C, D. Other manuscripts have "ye require;" but the sound of the two words in Hellenistic Greek would have been almost indistinguishable. <span class="cmt_word">That a man be found faithful.</span> We have a right to demand that on trial he be proved to be honest and diligent. So our Lord has described the "faithful and wise steward" in <a href="../../par/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42, 43</a>. What is required of ministers is neither brilliancy, nor eloquence, nor profound knowledge, nor success, but only - fidelity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. The Corinthians might have expected that the conclusion of St. Paul's remarks would be a recognition of their right to sit in judgment on his faithfulness; but it is, on the contrary, an expression of his complete indifference to their shallow and unfair estimate, and an appeal to the approval of his own conscience and to the judgment of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">It is a very small thing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is for the least. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That I should be judged of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that I should be examined by you</span> (<span class="accented">anakritho</span>). Technically the word <span class="accented">anakrisis</span> means "an examination preliminary to trial." <span class="cmt_word">Or of man's judgment</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of man's day.</span> The brief day of human life is bounded by too narrow an horizon for accurate judgments. Many of the greatest and best men have felt, like Lord Bacon, that they must leave to other generations the right estimate of their characters, views, and actions. St. Jerome reckons the expression "day" for "judgment" among the "Cilicisms" of St. Paul (Jeremiah, 'Ad Algas.,' 10), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the expressions due to his early training in Cilicia. More probably (as Grotius thinks) there is a reference to the "day" fixed for earthly trials (<span class="accented">diem dicere</span>, equivalent to "to impeach"), and to the phrase "the day of judgment" - "the woeful day" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>. The word "day" in all languages and idioms signifies "judgment" (Hammond). From <span class="accented">dies</span>, a day, comes the phrase "a diet." A "daysman" means an arbitrator. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I judge not mine own self.</span> Here, as in the previous clause and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>, the verb is not <span class="accented">krino</span>, I judge, but <span class="accented">anakrino</span>, I examine. Thus the verse discourages all morbid self introspection. It also shows that St. Paul is not arrogantly proclaiming himself superior to the opinion of the Corinthians, but is pointing out the necessary inadequacy of all human judgments. The heart is too liable to self deceit (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9, 10</a>) to enable it to pronounce a judgment with unerring accuracy. Hence neither a man's contemporaries nor the man himself can form any final estimate of him or of his fitting position, because their knowledge is too imperfect. History often reverses the decision of contemporaries. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know nothing by myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">nothing against myself.</span> The phrase of the Authorized Version originally meant this, but is now obsolete in this sense. "I am sorry that each fault can be proved by the queen," says Cranmer to Henry VIII. It is like the Latin <span class="accented">Nil conscire sibi.</span> The same phrase occurs in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/job/27-6.htm">Job 27:6</a>. St. Paul says, "The verdict of my own conscience acquits me of all intentional unfaithfulness;" but this is insufficient, because God sees with clearer eyes than ours. "Who can understand his errors?" asks the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>); and the "secret faults" against which he prays are not hidden vices, but sins of which he was himself unconscious. It must be remembered that St. Paul is here only speaking with conscious integrity of his ministerial work. Nothing could have been further from the mind of one who elsewhere calls himself" the chief of sinners" than to claim an absolute immunity from every form of self reproach. They who claim immaculate holiness can as little quote the sanction of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a>, etc.) as of any other saint. The confessions of the holiest are ever the most humble. <span class="cmt_word">Yet am I not hereby justified.</span> Because "every way of a man" is apt to be "right in his own eyes," but God pondereth the hearts, and therefore in God's sight "no man living is justified." St. Paul is here using the word in its legal rather than its theological sense. <span class="cmt_word">He that judgeth me is the Lord.</span> This is a reason for serious awe and deep self searching of heart (<a href="../../par/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>). Yet also for hope and confidence when a man can, like the modern statesman, "look from the storm without to the sunshine of an approving conscience within." For God, being "greater than our hearts" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>), may count "the long 'yes' of life" against the one "no," or the single faithless minute. Knowing whereof we are made, remembering that we are but dust, he looks on us <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"With larger other eyes than ours,<br />To make allowance for us all."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judge nothing.</span> St. Paul, in the Epistle to the Romans, insists with some indignation on this duty of checking the tendency to vain depreciation, both because we have not the capacity for forming adequate judgments, and because censoriousness is a very common though thoroughly unchristian vice (<a href="../../par/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4, 10, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Before the time.</span> The time is when God shall "judge the secrets of men" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>), and when "the day shall try every man's work of what sort it is" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Until the Lord come.</span> The advent is called in the New Testament sometimes the "epiphany," and sometimes the <span class="accented">parousia</span> of Christ. The word used for "until" (<span class="accented">heos an</span>) points to a time entirely indefinite. <span class="cmt_word">Both</span>; rather, <span class="accented">also</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among other things. <span class="cmt_word">The hidden things of darkness.</span> "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). God "shall illuminate the crypts of the darkness which naturally fills the self deceiving heart." <span class="cmt_word">The counsels of the hearts.</span> These may bear no scrutiny, even when the actions of the life have been made to look plausible enough. <span class="cmt_word">And then.</span> God only "seeth in secret" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>), and therefore the praise and blame of men may in this life be equally unjust. <span class="cmt_word">Shall every man have praise of God;</span> rather, <span class="accented">each one shall then have his praise</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> such praise as he deserves) <span class="accented">from God.</span> Some of the Greek Fathers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Theophylact) here make "praise" a "word of intermediate sense," involving either praise or blame. But St. Paul says "praise" for two reasons - partly because he is thinking of faithful teachers like Cephas, Apollos, and himself, who were depreciated by rival factions; and partly because he, like other apostles, shows an invariable tendency to allude to the bright rather than to the dark side of judgment. The "praise from God" - the "Well done, good and faithful servant" - is so infinitely precious that it reduces to insignificance the comparative value of human praise or blame. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Contrast between the inflated self sufficiency of the Corinthians and the earthly humiliation of the apostles.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>. The occasional use of this and similar expressions ("beloved," etc.) often serves to strengthen an appeal, or, as here, to soften the sternness of a rebuke. <span class="cmt_word">I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos.</span> The meaning seems to be that St. Paul has prominently transferred to himself and to Apollos, or rather to the parties who chose their names as watchwords, the proof as to the sin and futility of partisanship which applied equally well to the parties which ranged themselves under other names. (For the verb "transfer" - more often "transform" see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>.) He abstains purposely and generously from publicly naming the fuglemen of the antagonistic factions. <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes.</span> By rebuking party spirit in his own partisans and those of the teacher who was most closely allied to himself, he robbed his remarks of all semblance of personality or bitterness. It showed his generous delicacy not to allude rather to the adherents of Cephas and the Judaean emissary. <span class="cmt_word">Than ye might learn in us.</span> I made Apollos and myself instances of the undesirability of over exalting human teachers, that by our case you might learn the general principle. <span class="cmt_word">Not to think of men above that which is written.</span> The true reading is merely, <span class="accented">not above the things which have</span> been <span class="accented">written</span>, as though the words were a sort of proverb, like <span class="accented">Ne quid nimis</span> or Milton's "The rule of not too much" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The word "to think" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The phrase, "which have been written," is of very uncertain meaning. It may refer generally to "the scriptural rule" that all boasting is wrong (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>), or to the humble estimate of teachers which he has just been writing down for them. All his Old Testament quotations so far (ch. 1:19, 31; 3:19) have referred to humility. Some see in it a reference to <a href="../../par/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a> "Be not ye called Babbi;" but it is uncertain whether St. Matthew's Gospel was yet written; and St. Paul never refers so directly to any written Gospel. Perhaps it is a sort of proverb," Keep always to strict evidence;" "Say nothing which cannot be proved in black and white." The text, like so many others, has only a very remote connection with the sense in which it is usually quoted. <span class="cmt_word">That no one of you he puffed up.</span> St. Paul was painfully impressed by this <span class="accented">inflation</span> of the Corinthians, and he often recurs to this word as a description of their vain conceit (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). In other Epistles the word is only found once (in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For one against another.</span> The expression is a profound one. The glorying in men (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>), undesirable in any circumstances, becomes the more pernicious because the exaltation of one set of teachers is almost invariably accompanied by mean and unjust depreciation of any who could be supposed to be their rivals. The Corinthian who was "for Cephas" would be almost certain to be, to some extent, "<span class="accented">against</span> Paul."

The loving delicate irony is, in a different way, as effective as the stern denunciation of St. John: "Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). St. Paul's satire is always akin to charity; it is never satire with no pity in it. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have reigned as kings</span>. The word simply means "ye reigned." Like the Stoics, so each little Corinthian sectarian regarded himself as a king. "To reign" was, however, a proverbial phrase (like the Latin <span class="accented">vivo et regno</span>) for being "happy as a king." <span class="cmt_word">Without us</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-40.htm">Hebrews 11:40</a>). The Corinthians were cultivated enough to appreciate the deep irony of the phrase, "We poor apostles have become quite needless to you in your lordly independence." <span class="cmt_word">And I would to God ye did reign</span>. The words "to God" should be omitted. The loving heart of St. Paul could never long keep up a strain of irony. He drops the satire, and passes on to impassioned and affectionate appeal. <span class="cmt_word">That we also might reign with you.</span> If the exalted eminence which you now only enjoy in your own conceits had been but real, then we, whose "hope, and joy, and crown of exultation you are in the presence of Christ" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), should share the grandeur with you.

It showed the utter contempt with which they were treated; for though St. Paul ought to have been exempt from such violence, both as a freeman and a Roman citizen, he was treated as vilely as if he had been a mere foreign slave. <span class="cmt_word">Have no certain dwelling place.</span> This homelessness was among the severest of all trials (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>).

It may mean "we entreat men not to speak thus injuriously of us" (Calvin); or "we exhort them to do right." <span class="cmt_word">As the filth of the world</span>. The Greek word <span class="accented">katharmata</span> has a technical sense, in which it means "men devoted to death for purposes of expiation" (<span class="accented">homines piaculares</span>). The word <span class="accented">perikatharnmta</span> has the sense of "sin offerings" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-18.htm">Proverbs 21:18</a>; Tobit 5:18. It is, however, doubtful whether this meaning of the word could have been at all familiar to Greek readers, and it is only in a very general and distantly metaphorical sense that the sufferings of God's saints can be regarded as, in any sense of the word, vicarious. It is better, therefore, here to retain the sense of "refuse" (<span class="accented">purgamenta</span>, things vile and worthless). <span class="cmt_word">The offscouring of all things;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">of</span> <span class="accented">all men.</span> The word <span class="accented">peripsema</span> means "a thing scraped off," and this word also was used in expiatory human sacrifices, where the formula used to victims thus flung into the sea, in times of plague or famine, was, "Become our <span class="accented">peripsema'</span> ('Schol. on Ar.;' Plut., 456). Thus in Tobit (5:18), Anna the wife of Tobias says, "Let the money be used as a <span class="accented">peripsema</span> for the child;" and Ignatius uses the phrase, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> From this and the similar phrase in the Letter of Barnabas," I am the <span class="accented">peripsema</span> of your love," it seems to have become a current expression of tenderness among Christians, "I am your <span class="accented">peripsema."</span> But in this case also it may be doubted whether the sacrificial idea was present in the apostle's mind. He is thinking of scenes which he had already faced and would have to face hereafter, when mobs shouted against him that he was "a pestilent fellow" (<a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>) and not fit to live (<a href="../../par/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>).
