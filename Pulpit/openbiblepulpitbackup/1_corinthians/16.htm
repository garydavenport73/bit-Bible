The subject weighed much on St. Paul's mind. First, there was real need for their charity, for at Jerusalem there was as sharp a contrast between the lots of the rich and poor as there is in London, and the "poor saints," being the poorest of the poor (<a href="../../par/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>), must have often been in deep distress. Not many years before this time, in the famine of Claudius, (<a href="../../par/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-30</a>), Queen Helena of Adiabene had kept the paupers of Jerusalem alive by importing cargoes of dried grapes and figs. Besides the periodical famines, the political troubles of Judaea had recently increased the general distress. Secondly, the tender heart of St. Paul was keenly alive to this distress. Thirdly, it was the only way in which the Gentile Churches could show their gratitude to the mother Church. Lastly, the Apostle St. Paul had solemnly promised the apostles at Jerusalem that he would remember the poor (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hence he frequently alludes to this collection (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a> <a href="../../par/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>, etc.). The enthusiastic communism of the earliest Christian society in Jerusalem had soon ceased, being, as all experience proves, an impossible experiment under the conditions which regulate all human life, and it may have aggravated the chronic distress. <span class="cmt_word">As I have given order;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as I arranged.<span class="cmt_word"></span> To the Churches of Galatia.</span> Not in his extant letter to the Galatians, but either in a visit three years before this time (<a href="../../par/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>), or by letter. It appears from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a> that St. Paul had already asked for the contributions of the Corinthians. "To the Corinthians he proposes the example of the Galatians; to the Macedonians the example of the Corinthians; to the Romans that of the Macedonians and Corinthians. Great is the power of example" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Even so do ye.</span> The aorist implies that they should do it at once.

The true rendering is, <span class="accented">Whomsoever ye approve, these I will send with letters.</span> The letters would be letters of introduction or commendation (<a href="../../par/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>) to the apostles at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Your liberality;</span> literally, <span class="accented">your grace or favour</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the token of your voluntary affection.

St. Paul would not take this money himself. His "religious" enemies were many, bitter, and unscrupulous, and he would give them no possibility of a handle against him. He makes such arrangements as should place him above suspicion (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20</a>). It turned out that the subscription was an adequate one, and St. Paul accompanied the Corinthian delegates (<a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). The thought that they might visit Jerusalem and see some of the twelve would act as an incentive to the Corinthians.

He had in an Epistle, now lost (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>), announced to them this intention, he changed his plan because, in the present disgraceful state of disorganization into which the Church had fallen, he felt that he could not visit them without being compelled to exercise a severity which, he hoped, might be obviated by writing to them and delaying his intended visit. Nothing but his usual delicacy and desire to spare them prevented him from stating all this more fully (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>). Mistaking the kindness of his purpose, the Corinthians accused him of levity. He defends himself from this charge in the Second Epistle, and he carried out the plan which he here announces (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).

The acceptance of this favour at their hands was a proof of affection. It was the custom in ancient days to accompany a departing guest for a short distance (<a href="../../par/romans/15-24.htm">Romans 15:24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whithersoever I go.</span> St. Paul well knew that some uncertainty must attach to his plans. As it was, he had to change his plan at the last moment. He had meant to sail from Corinth, but, owing to a plot to assassinate him, he was obliged to go overland round by Macedonia (<a href="../../par/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>).

But possibly he had <span class="accented">countermanded</span> these directions when he postponed his own visit. In the uncertainties of ancient travelling, be could not be certain whether his counter order would reach Timothy or not. It appears to have done so, for nothing is said of any visit of Timothy to Corinth, and St. Paul sent Titus. <span class="cmt_word">Without fear.</span> Timothy must at this time have been very young (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). As a mere substitute for St. Paul's personal visit, he would be unacceptable. In every allusion to him we find traces of a somewhat timid and sensitive disposition (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6-8</a>, etc.). He may well, therefore, have shrunk from the thought of meeting the haughty sophisters and disputatious partisans of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">As I also do.</span> "As a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). St. Paul felt for Timothy a deeper personal tenderness than for any of his other friends, and the companionship of this gentle and devoted youth was one of the chief comforts of his missionary labour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-11.htm">1 Corinthians 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no man therefore despise him.</span> His youth and modesty seemed to invite a contempt which was only too consonant with the character of the Corinthians. <span class="cmt_word">I look for him with the brethren</span>. There was a reason for adding this. The Corinthians would see that any unkindness or contempt shown towards Timothy would at once be reported to St. Paul. Who "the brethren" are is not mentioned, for in <a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> we are only told that Timothy was accompanied by Erastus. Perhaps St. Paul means with the brethren who conveyed this letter (see ver. 12), and who, as he supposed, would meet with Timothy at Corinth, or fall in with him on their return to meet St. Paul in Macedonia. One of these brethren must have been Titus (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7</a>), and there were two others.

St. Paul anticipated this sneer. His nature was much too noble to feel the least jealousy. Both he and Apollos here show themselves in the purest light. <span class="cmt_word">His will;</span> literally, <span class="accented">there was not will.</span> The word "will" most frequently means "the will <span class="accented">of God,"</span> but if that had been the meaning here, the word would have had the article.

Here it means that Apollos had decided not to come at present, obviously because his name had been abused for purposes of party faction (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5</a>). This was all the more noble on his part because he seems to have been a special friend of Titus (<a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>). St. Paul would gladly have sent his two ablest and most energetic disciples to this distracted Church. <span class="cmt_word">When he shall have convenient time;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when a good opportunity offers itself to him.</span> Whether Apollos ever revisited Corinth or not we do not know.

The verb which expresses Christian manliness ("Play the men!") occurs here only. It is found in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>.

It was a sign of the reconciliation of all dissensions. But the abuse of the practice and the hideous heathen calumnies which it helped to perpetuate, led to its abolition. In the Roman Church a shadow of it still remains in the custom of the congregation kissing the <span class="accented">pax</span> after the priest has kissed it.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-21.htm">1 Corinthians 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">The salutation of <i>me</i> Paul with mine own hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With mine own hand.</span> Every one of St. Paul's Epistles, except that to the Galatians (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a>), seems to have been written by an amanuensis. The blaze of light in the vision on the road to Damascus seems to have left him with acute and permanent ophthalmia as his "thorn in the flesh;" and this would naturally disincline him to the physical labour of writing. When he did write, his letters seem to have been large and straggling (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a>), But this was an age in which documents were frequently falsified by designing persons, and this seems to have happened to St. Paul after he had written his very first extant letter. After warning the Thessalonians not to be frightened "by epistle <span class="accented">as from us"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>), he adds, at the close of the letter, that henceforth he intends to authenticate every letter by an autograph salutation (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a>). To this bad and dangerous practice of forgery is due the energetic appeal of <a href="../../par/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18, 19</a>. A similar appeal to copyists, couched in the most solemn language, is found in Irenaeus ('Opp.,' 1:821, edit. Stieren), and at the end of Rufinus's prologue to his translation of Origen's 'De Principiis.' 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a></div><div class="verse">If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man love not,</span> etc. This sentence (as in <a href="../../par/colossians/4-18.htm">Colossians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>) is part of the autograph salutation. The verb here used for "love" (<span class="accented">philo</span>) was perhaps suggested by the word for "kiss" (<span class="accented">philema</span>). The word generally used for "love of God" is <span class="accented">agapae</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>), which implies less warmth, but deeper reverence. But this passage is full of emotion. <span class="cmt_word">Let him be Anathema.</span> The word only occurs elsewhere in 1 Corinthians 12:3; <a href="../../par/acts/23-13.htm">Acts 23:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-74.htm">Matthew 26:74</a>, "to curse"). It is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">cherem</span>, a ban (<a href="../../par/leviticus/27-29.htm">Leviticus 27:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>, etc.). I cannot pretend to understand what St. Paul means by it, unless it be "Let personal love to Christ be the <span class="accented">essential</span> of Christian fellowship, and let him who has it not be regarded <span class="accented">as</span> <span class="accented">apart from the Church."</span> Commentators call it "an imprecation," or "malediction," and say that it means "Let him be devoted to God's wrath and judgment." That language is, indeed, very like the language of religious hatred and religious usurpation in all ages, but it is the very antithesis to the general tone of the apostle. <span class="accented">If</span> this were the meaning, it would seem to resemble the very spirit which Christ himself severely rebuked as the Elijah spirit, not the Christ spirit. But I do not believe that, even in a passing outburst of strong emotion, St. Paul had any such meaning. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Jews used <span class="accented">cherem</span>, not only of the severer form of excommunication (<span class="accented">shem atha</span>), but even of the milder and by no means severe <span class="accented">temporary</span> form (<span class="accented">nidui</span>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it cannot be <span class="accented">more</span> severe than "handing over to Satan" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), which was merciful in its purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Maran-atha;</span> two words, <span class="accented">the Lord cometh</span>; like the Jewish <span class="accented">shem atha</span>, "the Name cometh," or, "the Lord comes." It seems to be an appeal to the judgment of Christ, and may possibly have been an allusion to <a href="../../par/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>, the words with which the Old Testament ends (see <a href="../../par/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14, 15</a>).
