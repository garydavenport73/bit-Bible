In the first, which extends to the end of ver. 6, Job is engaged in maintaining, with the utmost possible solemnity (ver. 2), both his actual integrity (ver. 6) and his determination to hold fast his integrity as long as he lives (vers. 4-6). In the second (vers. 7-10) he implicates a curse upon his enemies. In the third (vers. 11-23) he returns to the consideration of God's treatment of the wicked, and retracts the view which he had maintained controversially in <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, with respect to their prosperity, impunity, and equalization with the righteous in death. The retractation is so complete, the concessions are so large, that some have been induced to question whether they can possibly have been made by Job, and have been led on to suggest that we have here a third speech of Zophar's, such as "the symmetry of the general form" requires, which by accident or design has been transferred from him to Job. But the improbability of such a transfer, considering how in the Book of Job the speech of each separate interlocutor is introduced, is palpable; the dissimilarity between the speech and the other utterances of Zophar is striking; and (;he judgment of two such liberal critics as Ewald and Renan, that the passage is rightly placed, and rightly assigned to Job, should set all doubt at rest, and make an end of controversy (see Mr. Froude's 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1 pp. 315, 316; and Canon Cook's "Introduction to the Book of Job," in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span>. The word translated "parable" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;</span>) is only used previously in <a href="../../par/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23</a>, and 24. It is thought to "comprehend all discourses in which the results of discursive thought are concisely or figuratively expressed" (Cook). The introduction of a new term seems to imply that the present discourse occupies a position different from that of all the preceding ones. It is not tentative, controversial, or emotional, but expresses the deliberate judgment of the patriarch on the subjects discussed in it. Note the repetition of the term in <a href="../../par/job/29-1.htm">Job 29:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/27-2.htm">Job 27:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> God liveth, <i>who</i> hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, <i>who</i> hath vexed my soul;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As</span> <span class="cmt_word">God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment</span>, Job has not previously introduced any form of adjuration. His "yea has been yea, and his nay nay." Now, however, under the solemn circumstances of the occasion, when he is making his last appeal to his friends for a favourable judgment, he thinks it not inappropriate to preface what he is about to say by an appeal to God as his Witness. "As God liveth," or "As the Lord liveth," was the customary oath of pious Israelites and of God-fearing men generally in the ancient world (see <a href="../../par/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-13.htm">2 Chronicles 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a>). Job adds that the God to whom he appeals is he who has "taken away," or "withheld," his judgment, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who has declined to enter with him into a controversy as to the justice of his doings (<a href="../../par/job/9-32.htm">Job 9:32-35</a>; 13:31; 23:3-7). <span class="cmt_word">And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul</span>; or, <span class="accented">made my soul bitter.</span> Though he slays him, yet does Job trust in God (<a href="../../par/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>). He is his Witness, his Helper, his Redeemer (<a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a>).

Job claims in it to be in possession of all his faculties, notwithstanding his sufferings. The right translation would seem to be, "For my life is yet whole within me" (see the Revised Version). <span class="cmt_word">And the spirit of God is in my nostrils</span>. The spirit of God, originally  breathed into man's nostrils, whereby he became a living soul (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), is still, Job says, within him, and makes him capable of judging and declaring what is right.

Nothing shall induce him, Job says, to speak knowingly wicked words. Nor my tongue utter deceit. Neither will he be induced, whatever happens, to utter untruth. A confession of guilt, such as his friends have endeavoured to extort from him, would be both wicked and false.

Not only will Job never cease to maintain his integrity in the past, but he will hold fast to the same course of blameless life in the future. He will not "curse God, and die." Resolutely he will maintain his faith in God, and his dependence on him. "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." <span class="cmt_word">My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live</span>. This is probably the true meaning, though some suggest "My heart doth not reproach me for any of my days" Job determines to "have always a conscience void of offence, both toward God and toward man" (<a href="../../par/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>).

The nexus of this passage with what goes before is uncertain. Some suppose Job's full thought to have been, "Ye try to persuade me to act wickedly by making a false representation of my feelings and convictions; but I absolutely refuse to do so. Let that rather be the act of my enemy." Others regard him as simply so vexed by his pretended friends, who are his real enemies, that he is driven to utter an imprecation against them. <span class="cmt_word">And he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous</span>. This is another instance of a mere pleonastic hemistich - a repetition of the preceding clause in different words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/27-8.htm">Job 27:8</a></div><div class="verse">For what <i>is</i> the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained</span>. The hypocrite and liar may get advantage in this life by his lies and his hypocrisy. He may deceive men; he may raise himself in their opinion; he may derive worldly advantage from having secured their approval But what will he have to look forward rein the end, <span class="cmt_word">when God taketh away</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> removeth from earth) <span class="cmt_word">his soul?</span> Job evidently regards the soul that is "taken away" or removed from earth as still existing, still conscious, still capable of hope or of despair, and asks what hope of a happy future could the man who had lived a hypocrite entertain, when God required his soul, and he felt under God's judgment. The question reminds us of those words of our blessed <span class="accented">Lord</span> "What shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" (<a href="../../par/mark/8-36.htm">Mark 8:36, 37</a>).

No; conscious hypocrisy - living a lie - cuts off from God, severs between a man and his Maker, makes all prayers for help vain, until it is repented of and put away from us. The man who dies in it is in a desperate case. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/27-10.htm">Job 27:10</a></div><div class="verse">Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will he delight himself in the Almighty?</span> A further ill result of hypocrisy is noted. Not only does it alienate God from us, but it nile,ares us from God. The hypocrite cannot "delight in the Almighty." He must shriek from him, tear him, dislike to dwell on the thought of his presence and realize it. His natural inclination must be to withdraw his thoughts from God, and give himself up to the worldliness which has been his attraction to assume the hypocrite's part. <span class="cmt_word">Will he always call upon God?</span> Can be even be depended on not to renounce the service of God altogether? The mutual alienation above spoken of must tend to check communion, to disincline to prayer and calling upon God, to erect a barrier between the hypocrite and the Almighty, which, though for a while it may be insufficient to withstand the force of use and wont, will yet, in the long run, be sure to tell, and will either put an end to prayer altogether, or reduce it to a formality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/27-11.htm">Job 27:11</a></div><div class="verse">I will teach you by the hand of God: <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> with the Almighty will I not conceal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-23.</span> - It is impossible to deny that this passage directly contradicts Job's former utterances, especially <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>. But the hypotheses which would make Job irresponsible for the present utterance and fix on him, as his steadfast conviction, the opposite theory, are unsatisfactory and have no solid basis. To suppose that Zophar is the real speaker is to imagine the absolute loss and suppression of two entire verses - one between vers. 10 and 11, assigning the speech to him, and another at the beginning  of ch. 28, reintroducing Job and making him once more the interlocutor. That this should have happened by accident is inconceivable. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> To ascribe it to intentional corruption by a Hebrew redactor, bent on maintaining the old orthodox view, and on falsely and wickedly giving the authority of Job to it (Froude 'Short Studies on Great Subjects,' vol. 1. p. 316), is to take away all authority from the existing text of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to open a door to any amount of wild suggestion and conjectural emendation. The other hypothesis - that of Eichhorn - that Job is here simply anticipating what his adversaries will say, though a less dangerous view, is untenable, since Job never does this without following up his statement of the adversaries' ease with a reply, and here is no reply whatever, but a simple turning away, after ver. 23, to another subject. The explanation of the contradiction by supposing that Job's former statement was tentative and controversial, or else hasty and ill-considered, and that now, to prevent misconception, he determines to set himself right, is, on the other hand, thoroughly defensible, and receives a strong support from the remarkable introduction in ver. 11, which "prepares us, if not for a recantation, yet (at any rate) for a modification of statements wrung from the speaker when his words flowed over from a spirit drunk with the poison of God's arrows" (see the remarks of Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 90, which are in substantial agreement with those of Ewald said Dillmann). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will teach you by</span> (or, concerning) <span class="cmt_word">the hand of God</span>. Job is now at last about to deliver his real sentiments respecting God's dealings with men in the world, and prefaces his. remarks with this solemn introduction, to draw special attention to them. He is aware that his previous statements on the subject, especially in <a href="../../par/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2-24</a>, have been overstrained and exaggerated, and wishes, now that he is uttering his last words (<a href="../../par/job/31-40.htm">Job 31:40</a>), to correct his previous hasty utterances, and put on record his true views. <span class="cmt_word">That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal</span>. By "that which is with the Almighty" Job means the Divine principles of action.

The true Divine scheme of action has been so long and so frequently made manifest - openly set forth in the sight o! men - that Job cannot believe that those whom he addresses are ignorant of it. They must themselves have seen the scheme at work. <span class="cmt_word">Why then are ye thus altogether vain?</span> Why, then, do they not draw true inferences from the facts that come under their notice?

In "this" Job includes all that follows from ver. 14 to ver. 23 - "this, which I am going to lay down." He pointedly takes up the words of Zophar in <a href="../../par/job/20-29.htm">Job 20:29</a>, admitting their general truth. And the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

Among the items of prosperity which Job had assigned to the wicked man in one of his previous discourses (<a href="../../par/job/21-8.htm">Job 21:8, 11</a>) was a numerous and flourishing offspring. Now he feels forced to admit that, frequently at any rate, this flourishing offspring is overtaken by calamity (<a href="../../par/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>) - it falls by the sword, either in predatory warfare, to which it was bred up, or as the consequence of a blood-feud inherited from its progenitor. They who "take the sword," either in their own persons or in their posterity, "perish with the sword." <span class="cmt_word">And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread</span>. If they escape this fate, then, mostly, they fall into poverty, and suffer want, no one caring to relieve them, since they have an ill reputation, the memory of their parent's wickedness clinging to them long after his decease.

He is at all times uneasy; sometimes he experiences a sudden rush upon him of such gloomy thoughts, which overwhelms him, and sweeps him away like a mighty stream. <span class="cmt_word">A tempest stealeth him away in the night</span>. While he is off his guard, as it were, in the night, a sudden storm bursts on him, and removes him from his place.

This is little more than a repetition of the previous hemistich. The man is swept from the earth by a storm of calamity

Some commentators regard the storm as still the subject, and translate, "For it shall east itself upon him [or, 'rush upon him'] and not spore" (Sohultens, Merx). The difference is not great, since the storm represents God's judgment. <span class="cmt_word">He would fain flee out of his hand</span>; or, if the storm is meant, <span class="accented">out of its</span> hand.
