God calls upon Job to make good his charges (vers. 1, 2). Job declines, acknowledges himself to be of no account, and promises silence and submission for the future (vers. 3-5).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a></div><div class="verse">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-24.</span> - This passage, together with the whole of ch. 41, has been regarded by some critics as an interpolation. Its omission would certainly not affect the argument; and it is thought, in some respects, to contain traces of a later age than that which most commentators assign to the remainder of the book, or, at any rate, to the greater portion of it. The recurrence to the animal creation, when the subject seemed to have been completed (<a href="../../par/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>), is also a difficulty. But, on the other hand, as there is no variation, either in the manuscripts or in the versions, and no marked difference either of style or tone of thought between the rest of the book and this controverted passage, it is best regarded as an integral portion of the work, proceeding from the same author, although perhaps at a later period. No one denies that the style is that of the best Hebrew poetry, or that the book would be weakened by the excision of the passage. "Le style," says M. Renan, "est celui des meilleurs endroits du poeme. Nulle part la coupe n'est pins vigoreuse, le parallelisme plus sonore.' <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold now behemoth</span>. "Behemoth" is ordinarily the plural of <span class="accented">behemah</span>  "a beast;" but it is scarcely possible to understand the word in this sense in the present passage, where it seems to be a noun singular, being followed by singular verbs, and represented by singular pronouns. Hence modern critics almost unanimously regard the word here as designating "some particular animal." The mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, and the elephant have been suggested. Of these the mammoth is precluded by the want of any evidence that it existed in Job's day, and the rhinoceros by the absence of any allusion to its peculiar feature. Authorities are divided almost equally between the elephant and the hippopotamus; but the best recent Hebraists and naturalists incline rather to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which I made with thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "which I created at the same time as I created thee" (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He eateth grass as an ox</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is graminivorous, not carnivorous. This is admitted to be true of the hippopotamus, which lives in the Nile during the day, and at night emerges from the river, and devastates the crops of sugar-cane, rice, and millet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/40-16.htm">Job 40:16</a></div><div class="verse">Lo now, his strength <i>is</i> in his loins, and his force <i>is</i> in the navel of his belly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo now, his strength is in his loins</span>. The strength of the hippopotamus is its principal characteristic. Weighing often two thousand kilogrammes, and of a short thick make, when roused to anger it has a force which is irresistible. In the water it upsets large beats; on land it forces its way through dense thickets and fences of all kinds. The loins are especially strong, being deep, broad, and immensely muscular<span class="cmt_word">. And his force is in the navel of his belly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the muscles of his bell'i.</span> The word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) occurs only in this place. It is a plural form, and therefore cannot designate a single object, like the navel. The root seems to be the Syriac <span class="accented">serir</span> "firm," whence Schultens proposes to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="accented">firmitates.</span>

The tail of the hippopotamus is remarkably short and thick. It only bends slightly, being stiff and unyielding, like the stem of a cedar. <span class="cmt_word">The sinews of his stones</span> (rather, <span class="accented">of his thighs</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>are wrapped together</span>; or, <span class="accented">interwoven one with another</span> (so Professor Lee and Mr. Houghton).

These are hollow, being filled with marrow, and are so strong that they may be well compared to "tubes of bronze." (On the identity of <span class="accented">nekhushah or nekhosheth</span> with "bronze" rather than "brass," see the article on "Brass," in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 225.) His bones (rather, <span class="accented">his ribs</span>) are like bars of iron. Either the ribs, or the solid bones of the lower leg, forearm, etc., are intended.

This is the main argument in favour of the elephant, rather than the hippopotamus, being intended (see Schultens, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.). It has, indeed, been argued that some specimens of the hippopotamus exceed the elephant in height and bulk (Canon Cook, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 19); but no modern naturalist certainly would place the former animal above the latter in any <span class="accented">catalogue raisonee</span> of animals arranged according to their size and importance. The elephant, however, may not have been known to the author of Job, or, at any rate, the Asiatic species, which seems not to have been imported into Assyria before the middle of the  <span class="date">ninth century B.C.</span> In this case, the hippopotamus might well seem to him the grandest of the works of God. <span class="cmt_word">He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him</span>. This is explained to mean, "Only God can attack behemoth with success and slay him; man is powerless to do so" (Canon Cook, Stanley Leathes, Revised Version). But the Egyptians, from very early times, used to attack the hippopotamus and slay him (Wilkinson, in the author's 'Herodotus,' vol. 2, p. 100). It is better, therefore, to translate the passage, with Schultens, "He that made him hath furnished him with his sword," and to understand by "his sword" those sharp teeth with which the hippopotamus is said to "cut the grass as <span class="accented">neatly as if it were mown</span> and to sever, as <span class="accented">if</span> <span class="accented">with shears</span> a tolerably stout and thick stem" (Wood, ' Natural History,' vol. 1. p. 762).

Neither the hippopotamus nor the elephant is an inhabitant of "mountains," according to our use of the word. But the <span class="accented">harim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) of the original is used of very moderate eminences. In the highly poetical language of Job, and especially of this passage, the term may well be applied to the hills on either side of the Nile, which approach closely to the river, and to this day furnish the hippopotamus with a portion of its food (see Hasselquist, ' Travels,' p. 188). <span class="cmt_word">Where all the beasts of the field play</span>. By "the beasts of the <span class="accented">field"</span> seem to be meant the cattle and other do-mastic animals which are not driven from their pasture-grounds by the "river-horse" (Tristram, 'Nat.

Cook, Houghton, and others). But the identification is very doubtful. The dense shade of trees is sought alike by the hippopotamus and the elephant. <span class="cmt_word">In the covert of the reed, and fens.</span> This is exactly descriptive of the hippopotamus; far less so of the elephant. Gordon Cumming says, "At every turn there occurred deep still pools, and occasional sandy islands, densely clad with lofty reeds Above and beyond these reeds stood trees of immense age. beneath which grew a rank kind of grass, on which the sea-cow (hippopotamus) delights to pasture" ('Lion-Hunter of South Africa,' p. 297).
