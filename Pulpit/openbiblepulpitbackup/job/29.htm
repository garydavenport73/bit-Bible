The present chapter is concerned only with the former period; and gives a graphic description of the life led, in Job's time and country, by a great chieftain, the head of a tribe, not of mere nomads, but of perseus who had attained to a considerable amount of civilization. The picture is one primitive in its features, but not rude or coarse. It is entirely un-Jewish, and has its nearest parallel in some of the early Egyptian records, as the Stele of Beka, and the Instructions of Amen-em-hat ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 11-16; vol. 10. pp. 7-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said</span> (see the comment on Job 27:1).

To Job the period of his prosperity seems long, long ago - some-thing far away in the mist of time, which he recalls with difficulty<span class="cmt_word">. As in the days when God preserved me</span>. Job never forgets to refer his prosperity to God, or to be grateful to him for it (see <a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8-12</a>, etc.).

A "candle," or "lamp," is a general symbol in Scripture for life and prosperity. God is said to light men's candles when he blesses them and maizes his countenance to shine upon them; conversely, when he withdraws his favour he is said to put their candles out (<a href="../../par/job/18-6.htm">Job 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And when by his light I walked through darkness</span>. The light of God's countenance shining about a man's path enables him to walk securely even through thick darkness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through trouble and perplexity.

When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle</span>; or, <span class="accented">the counsel of God</span>; when, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in my tent I held sweet counsel with God, and communed with him as friend with friend (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>, "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant;" and <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>, "For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous").

These are terribly sad words. Job, in his afflictions, has come to look on the Almighty as no longer "with him " - no longer on his side; but rather against him, an enemy (see <a href="../../par/job/6-4.htm">Job 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-19.htm">Job 7:19</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-17.htm">Job 9:17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-16.htm">Job 10:16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">When my children were about me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/1-2.htm">Job 1:2, 4, 5</a>).

Trod, as it were, upon fatness, moved amid all that was gladsome, joyful, and delicious. <span class="cmt_word">And the rock poured me out rivers of oil</span>. "The rock" is probably the ground, rugged and stony, on which his olives grew. "Olives," says Dr. Cunningham Geikie, "flourish best on sandy or <span class="accented">stony</span> soil" ('The Holy Land and the Bible' vol. 1. p. 138) They brought him in so great a quantity of oil that the rock seemed to him to flow with rivers of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a></div><div class="verse">When I went out to the gate through the city, <i>when</i> I prepared my seat in the street!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I went out to the gate through the city</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by the city</span>, or over <span class="accented">against the city.</span> The "gate" was the place where justice was administered, and public business generally despatched. It would be "over against" the city, separated from it by a large square or place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>), in which a multitude might assemble (sue <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>). Hither Job was accustomed to proceed  from time to time, to act as judge and administrator. When I prepared my seat in the street. On such occasions a seat would be brought out and "prepared," where the judge would sit to hear causes and deliver sentences (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-8.htm">Job 29:8</a></div><div class="verse">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, <i>and</i> stood up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The young men saw me, and hid themselves</span>; retired, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> withdrew to corners, that they might not obtrude themselves on one so much their superior. Compare the respect paid to age by the Spartans. And the aged arose, and stood up. Here the respect paid was not to age so much as to dignity. Men as old as himself, or older, paid Job the compliment of standing up until he was seated, in consideration of his rank and high office. So. in many assemblies, as in our own courts of justice, in Convocation, and elsewhere, when the president enters, all rise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-9.htm">Job 29:9</a></div><div class="verse">The princes refrained talking, and laid <i>their</i> hand on their mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes refrained talking</span>. The other head-men of the tribe, recognizing Job's superior rank and dignity, refrained from words as soon as he made his appearance, and in silence awaited what he would say. Perhaps we are scarcely to understand literally the further statement that they laid their hand on their mouth, which is probably as much an idiom as our phrase, "they held their tongues "(comp. <a href="../../par/job/21-5.htm">Job 21:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-10.htm">Job 29:10</a></div><div class="verse">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The nobles held their peace</span>. The other leading men followed the example of the "princes," and equally kept silence till Job had spoken. And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their month. A pleonastic repetition. The meaning is simply they said nothing, they stood in rapt attention. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-11.htm">Job 29:11</a></div><div class="verse">When the ear heard <i>me</i>, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw <i>me</i>, it gave witness to me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the ear heard me, then it blessed me</span>. Job, having described his reception by the nobles and chief men of the city, proceeds to speak of the behaviour of the common people. The former were respectful and attent, the latter rejoiced and made acclamation. Being of the class most exposed to oppression and wrong, they hailed in the patriarch a champion and a protector. They were sure of redress and justice where he was the judge. <span class="cmt_word">And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me</span>. The eye of the poor man lighted up with joy and rejoicing as Job sat down upon the seat of judgment, thus hearing witness to his fairness, candour, and integrity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-12.htm">Job 29:12</a></div><div class="verse">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and <i>him that had</i> none to help him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I delivered the poor that cried</span> (compare the Instructions of Amen-em-hat: "Because I have made the afflicted ones free from their afflictions, so that their cries are heard no more" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2 p. 12). And again the Inscription of Ameni-Amenemha: "No little child have I injured; no widow have I oppressed; no fisherman have I hindered; no shepherd have I detained; no foreman have I taken from his gang to employ him in forced labour" (ibid., vol. 12:63). <span class="cmt_word">And the fatherless, and him that had none to help him</span> (compare what is said of the ideal king in <a href="../../par/psalms/72-12.htm">Psalm 72:12-14</a>," He shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and <span class="accented">him that hath no helper.</span> He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall sabre the souls of the needy. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight"). Championship of the poor was anciently regarded as characteristic of the wise, good, strong ruler. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a></div><div class="verse">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me</span> (comp. ver. 11). Oppression in the East sometimes drives its victims to actual starvation or to suicide. Isaiah calls the oppressors against whom he inveighs "murderers" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>). These "perishing" ones Job often saved, and they "blessed" him. <span class="cmt_word">And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy</span>. How cold are the words of Ameni, "No widow have I oppressed," compared with these! Job was not content with mere abstinence from evil, mere negative virtue. He so actively and effectually relieved distress that affliction was turned into happiness, and lamentation into rejoicing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-14.htm">Job 29:14</a></div><div class="verse">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <i>was</i> as a robe and a diadem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-9.htm">Psalm 132:9</a>, etc.). Job "put on righteousness;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made it as the garment wherewith he clothed himself withal (<a href="../../par/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18, 19</a>), covered up with it all his own natural imperfections, and made it part and parcel of his being. It was a beautiful covering, and, when once he had put it on, it clung to him, and could not be removed. It "clothed him," or rather, if we translate the Hebrew literally, "clothed itself with him." putting him on, as he had put it on. It was not merely external; it was internal, a habit of his soul and spirit. <span class="cmt_word">My judgment was as a robe and a diadem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">my justice</span> (see the Revised Version). My "justice," or "righteousness" (for the words are synonymous), was at once my robe and my crown, my necessary clothing and my ornament (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-15.htm">Job 29:15</a></div><div class="verse">I was eyes to the blind, and feet <i>was</i> I to the lame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame</span>. The Persian kings had officials, whom they called their "eyes" and their "ears" - observers who were to inform them of all that went on in the provinces ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. p. 213). Job acted as "eyes" to the blind of his time, giving them the information which their infirmity hindered them from obtaining. He was also feet to the lame, taking  messages for them, going on their errands, and the like. He was kind and helpful to his fellow-men, not only in great, but also in little matters. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>was</i> a father to the poor: and the cause <i>which</i> I knew not I searched out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was a father to the poor</span> (comp. ver. 12, and see below, ch. 31:16-22): <span class="cmt_word">and the cause which I knew not I searched out</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the cause of him that</span> I <span class="accented">knew not</span> I searched out (see the Revised Version). When men were quite unknown to him, Job still gave to their causes the utmost possible attention, "searching them out," or investigating them, as diligently as if they had been the causes of his own friends.

It is scarcely meant, as Canon Cook supposes, that Job was himself the executioner. "Quod facit per allure facit per so." Job would regard as Age doing what he ordered to be done. <span class="cmt_word">And plucked the spoil out of his teeth</span>. Either by disappointing him of a prey which he was on the verge of making ms own, or by compelling him to make restitution of a prey that he had actually laid hold of.

But the view seems to be a mere rabbinical tradition, and is unsupported by etymology. <span class="accented">Khal</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means "sand" in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-22.htm">Jeremiah 33:22</a>; and elsewhere. It is taken in this sense by Rosenmuller, Schultens, Professor Lee, Canon Cook, and our Revisers.

Job compares himself, in his former prosperous state, to a tree growing by a river-side, which receives a double nourishment - from the actual water of the stream, which reaches its roots, and from the moisture evaporated from the stream, which hangs in the air, and descends in the shape of dew upon its leaves and branches. Both sources of refreshment represent the grace and favour of God.

My strength did not fail. When it seemed on the point of failing, it was secretly and mysteriously "renewed." Some commentators regard vers. 19 and 20 as a portion of the speech begun in ver. 18, and view the verbs, not as past tenses, but as futures (compare the translation of the Revised Version). The general meaning is much the same, whichever of the two views we take.
