The three phrases express the same idea, viz. the loathsome and hateful state to which Babylon is reduced. The language is derived from the prophets (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11-15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:39; 51:37). <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">hold</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, "a strong place"); the natural and fitting stronghold of the devils, rather than a place to which they are involuntarily confined.

"Delicacies." (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, occurs in the New Testament only here, and as a verb in vers. 7, 9, and (compounded) in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11</a>. It signifies overweening pride and insolence and wantonness, arising from superfluity of wealth and gifts. Cf. the warning to the Church of Laodicea (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard another voice from heaven, saying.</span> Probably the voice of another angel in succession to the one mentioned in ver. 1. Another angel takes up the theme, because the message is now directly addressed to Christians. <span class="cmt_word">Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</span> The angel says, "my people," because he is representing God. These words, resembling <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52.htm">Isaiah 52</a>:l; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; and especially <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6</a> (cf. also ver. 8), 45, recall also the warning of our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a> (cf. also <a href="../../par/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>, "I cannot do anything till thou be come thither"). Since the harlot, who is identical with Babylon, is representative of the faithless part of the Church of God, these words form a direct warning to Christians. The departure which is commanded is not necessarily a literal, visible one; but the command implies a dissociation from, and condemnation of, the works of Babylon. Lot's wife literally departed from Sodom, but was overtaken with punishment, because her heart was not dissevered from the wickedness of the city.

Exactly the description of the judgment of Babylon given in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>, "Forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies." The last part of the verse is a repetition of <a href="../../par/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</span> "You" is omitted in all the best manuscripts. The second "unto her," though supported by P, Syriac, Coptic, is omitted in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, etc.: <span class="accented">Render to her as she also rendered, and double the doubled things according to her works</span>, etc. The description of God's judgment is still founded on the denunciations against Babylon in Jeremiah (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>-29; 51:24; 16:18; cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>; and the legal retribution ordered in <a href="../../par/exodus/22-4.htm">Exodus 22:4-7</a>). The <span class="accented">cup which she hath filled</span> is that containing "the wine of her fornication (cf. ver. 3); she is now to receive a double measure of the cup of God's wrath (cf. ver. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7</a></div><div class="verse">How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her.</span> (For "lived deliciously," see on "delicacies," ver. 3.) The words are a re-echo and expansion of those in ver. 6 (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow;</span> <span class="accented">because she saith</span>, etc.; and contact with the succeeding verse. The prophetical writers still supply the imagery (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>, "I shall not sit as a widow;" see also <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-8.htm">Revelation 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong <i>is</i> the Lord God who judgeth her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine.</span> This is the retribution for her boasting in ver. 7 (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>, "These two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day," etc.). Alford says, "<span class="accented">death</span>, for her scorn of the prospect of widowhood; <span class="accented">mourning</span>, for her inordinate revelling; <span class="accented">famine</span>, for her abundance" (cf. ver. 3). The description is not to be taken literally, but is typical of a sudden and overwhelming reverse, viz. that which will occur at the last judgment day (cf. the words of our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-42</a>). Some writers see here an allusion to the second, third, and fourth seals (see <a href="../../par/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And she shall he utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</span> <span class="accented">Who judged her</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, and others. This is the fulfilment of the predicted punishment of the harlot (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>). The last clause replies, as it were, to the boast in ver. 7, "I sit as a queen," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning;</span> <span class="accented">and the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and revelled with her, shall weep and wait over her, when they see</span>, etc. It is noteworthy that this sentence is in the future tense; that in ver. 11 in the present; that in vers. 17, 18 in the past. (On "committed fornication," see ver. 3; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>. On "lived deliciously," see vers. 3, 7.) "Lament" is the same word used in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, "All kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him." Cf. the description of the fall of Tyre (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16</a>). (On "smoke," see on Revelation 9:2.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10</a></div><div class="verse">Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying.</span> Unconsciously acting upon the command in ver. 4, "Come out of her .... that ye receive not of her plagues." <span class="cmt_word">Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come;</span> <span class="accented">Woe, woe, the great city</span> (cf. the previous declaration of <span class="accented">woe</span> in <a href="../../par/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>). <span class="accented">In one hour</span> (cf. ver. 8). Some writers understand the "one hour" to refer to the space of time during which the kings rule (see <a href="../../par/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>); but a comparison with ver. 8 leads to the conclusion that the meaning is "suddenly;" the contrast in a short time between the two positions of Babylon enhancing the fearfulness of the visitation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her.</span> <span class="accented">Weep and mourn</span>; the historical present (see on ver. 9). The <span class="accented">kings</span> have been mentioned; the <span class="accented">merchants</span> and next the <span class="accented">seamen</span> are referred to, showing the wide distribution of "Babylon," and forbidding the application to a single state or city. The description which follows is analogous to that in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For no man buyeth their merchandise any more;</span> <span class="accented">their cargo.</span> We are naturally reminded of the action of the second beast in forbidding to buy and sell (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17</a>). Alford here recognizes the difficulty in applying the prophecy to Rome, either pagan or papal, and adds, "I leave this difficulty unsolved .... The details of this mercantile lamentation far more nearly suit London than Rome." (See the interpretation given of the harlot and Babylon on Revelation 17:1.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet.</span> (On "precious stone" and" linen," see on Revelation 15:6.) Such was the attire of the harlot (<a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). Writers have endeavoured to classify in various ways the articles mentioned, in order to obtain some signification from the numbers used. Thus Hengstenberg sees four hard and then four soft articles mentioned, and he reminds us that the number four is symbolical of the world: but this does not carry him beyond ver. 12. The articles enumerated seem naturally to fall into six classes (from which we can gather no information, unless we look upon six as typifying the world, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>). First, articles of personal adornment; second, articles used for furniture, etc.; third, objects of sensual gratification - smell, etc.; fourth, articles of food; fifth, animate possessions; sixth, souls of men. These certainly seem to be arranged in a kind of progressive order of importance. All the articles mentioned in the text above were of the highest value. <span class="accented">Purple</span> and <span class="accented">scarlet</span> (see <a href="../../par/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>) were the prerogative of kings; <span class="accented">silk</span> was so scarce, that its use was forbidden in the reign of Tiberius. <span class="cmt_word">And all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;</span> <span class="accented">and every ivory vessel, and every vessel</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Thyine wood</span> is "that of the <span class="accented">Thuya articulata</span>, Desfont., the <span class="accented">Callitris quadrivalvis</span> of present botanists. This tree was much prized by the ancient Greeks and Romans, on account of the beauty of its wood for various ornamental purposes. By the Romans the tree was called citrus, the wood citrum. It is a native of Barbary, and grows to the height of fifteen to twenty-five feet" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible '). In this passage the accusative case is used; the preceding nouns are in the genitive.

These form the fifth class (see on ver. 12). "Chariots," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span>, is not the word used in <a href="../../par/revelation/9-9.htm">Revelation 9:9</a>. It is a word probably of Gaulish origin. <span class="cmt_word">And souls of men.</span> The accusative again. Not in the ordinary acceptation of the word "souls," but rather "lives of men," as the Revised Version margin; that is, "living men." It is probable that the two expressions, "bodies" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) and "souls of men," refer to two classes of slaves.

The Authorized Version reading is found in C, 1, 17. Not only the heavenly inhabitants are to rejoice, but also those on earth who have been persecuted by her, as mentioned in ver. 24. The time is again described which has been already referred to in former parts of the book, and especially in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>. Some authors have held this verse to prove that the writer of the Apocalypse was not the <span class="accented">Apostle</span> John; either because <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> he speaks as if he were not an <span class="accented">apostle</span>, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because they assume that all the <span class="accented">apostles</span> are here referred to, and that they are in heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no ground for either presumption: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> A rhapsodical utterance of this nature cannot be interpreted literally; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the word "apostles" cannot be limited to the twelve; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as Dusterdieck justly observes, one might as well argue that the writer was not <span class="accented">a prophet.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By the "prophets "are primarily intended, perhaps, the Christian prophets (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>); but if Babylon is typical of the hostile world power, and the harlot of the faithless, worldly portion of God's Church, as we have seen them to be, the words are applicable to the Church of God in all ages. <span class="cmt_word">For God hath avenged you on her;</span> <span class="accented">for God hath judged your judgment on her.</span> The answer to the prayer of the martyrs in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>. The words, "your judgment," probably mean "that judgment which is her due for her treatment of you," as in the Authorized Version. Hengstenberg gives "the doom which she pronounced upon you." Wordsworth, laying stress upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, "out of," makes the words mean, "He has taken your cause out of her hands into his own."

The adjective, of course, refers to the mightiness of the deed wrought (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-61.htm">Jeremiah 51:61-64</a>, "Thou shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates; and thou shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise," etc.). The <span class="accented">sea</span> may be typical of the nations of the earth (see <a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thus with violence shall that groat city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all;</span> <span class="accented">Thus with a mighty fall shall Babylon, the great city, be cast down</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Alford translates "with a rush;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is peculiar to this passage. The complete nature of this extinction is indicated by the frequency of the words, "no more at all," in vers. 21-23.

(On the last phrase, see on ver. 21.) <span class="cmt_word">And the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee.</span> This passage, together with the following verse, is founded on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>.

Auberlen remarks, "Wherever true, faithful Christians are neglected and oppressed by the rulers of the Church, from avowed or secret antipathy to God's truth; where a false theology and science robs youth of its faith; where a pastor neglects, and keeps at a distance, the true living Christians in his flock, on account of the <span class="accented">signum crucis</span> which they bear; wherever we refuse or are ashamed to bear the reproach of Jesus Christ, our heavenly Master, even as he bore it, there we commit murder against the saints of God." Here is concluded the pronouncement of the judgment of Babylon; which may be said to answer the prayer in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>; and which forms the conclusion of the revelation commencing at <a href="../../par/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../revelation/17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Revelation 17"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Revelation 17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../revelation/19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Revelation 19"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Revelation 19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
