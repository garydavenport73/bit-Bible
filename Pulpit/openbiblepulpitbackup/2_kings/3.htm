But an image of the god for whom a "house" was built was so much a matter of course in the idolatrous systems of the East, that it might have seemed superfluous to mention it. The actual existence of the image appears later, when its destruction is recorded (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>). It seems that Jehoram, at the commencement of his reign, took warning by the fates of his father and brother, so far as to abolish the state worship of Baal, which his father had introduced, and to remove the image of Baal from the temple where it had been set up. The image, however, was not destroyed - it was only "put away."

The maintenance of the calf-worship was, no doubt, viewed as a political necessity. If the two sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel had been shut up, the images broken, and the calf-worship brought to an end, there would, as a matter of course, have been a general flocking of the more religious among the people to the great sanctuary of Jehovah at Jerusalem; and this adoption of Jerusalem as a spiritual center would naturally have led on to its acceptance as the general political center of the whole Israelite people. Israel, as a separate kingdom, a distinct political entity, would have disappeared. Hence every Israelite monarch, even the Jehovistic Jehu, felt himself bound, by the political exigencies of his position, to keep up the calf-worship, and maintain the religious system of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

The historian goes back to the origin of the war. He had already, in <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>, mentioned the revolt of Moab at the death of Ahab; but he now recalls his readers' attention to the fact, and to some extent explains it and accounts for it. Moab had been treated oppressively - had been forced to pay an extraordinarily heavy tribute - and was in a certain sense driven into rebellion (vers. 4, 5). Jehoram, when he came to the kingdom, determined to make a great effort to put the rebellion down, and to re-establish the authority of Israel over the revolted people His relations with Jehoshaphat of Israel were so close that he had no difficulty in persuading him to join in the war. He was also able to obtain the alliance of the King of Edom. Thus strengthened, he made no doubt of being successful, and confidently invaded the country (vers. 6-9). The course of the war is then related (vers. 10-27).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?

He had joined Ahab in his attack on the Syrians at Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>), and had thereby incurred the rebuke of Jehu the son of Hanani (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). This, however, had net prevented him from continuing his friendship with the Israelite royal house; he "joined himself with Ahaziah" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a>), Ahab's successor, and though their combined naval expedition met with disaster (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), yet he still maintained amicable relations with the Israelite court. Jehoram, therefore, confidently sought his active help when he made up his mind to engage in a war with Moab. <span class="cmt_word">The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle! And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my hones as thy horses.</span> Compare the answer which the same king had made to Ahab, when requested to join him in his attack on the Syrians (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>). The words were probably a common formula expressive of willingness to enter into the closest possible alliance. Jehoshaphat, it appears from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-35</a>, had, a little before this, been himself attacked by the united forces of Moab and Ammon, and brought into a peril from which he was only delivered by miracle. It was, therefore, much to his advantage that Moab should be weakened. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Which way shall we go up?</span> Jehoram asked Jehoshaphat's advice as to the plan of campaign. There 'were two ways in which Moab might be approached - the direct one across the Jordan and then southward through the country east of the Dead Sea to the Amen, which was the boundary between Moab and Israel; and a circuitous one through the desert west of the Red Sea, and across the Arabah south of it, then northwards through Northern Edom, to the brook Zered, or Wady-el- Ahsy, which was the boundary between Moab and Edom. If the former route were pursued, Moab would be entered on the north; if the latter, she would be attacked on the south. Jehoshaphat recommended the circuitous route. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom</span>; probably for two reasons: Edom, though under a native king, was a dependency of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and on passing through the Edomite country, an Edomite contingent might be added to the invading force; Moab, moreover, was mere likely to be surprised by an attack on this quarter, which was unusual, and from which she would not anticipate danger. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the King of Israel went</span> - as leader of the expedition, he is placed first - <span class="cmt_word">and the King of Judah</span> - the second in importance, therefore placed second - <span class="cmt_word">and the King of Edom</span> - the third in importance, therefore placed last. It is to be remarked that, when Edom was last mentioned, she was ruled by a "deputy," who received his appointment from the King of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>). Now, apparently, she has her own native "king." The change is, perhaps, to be connected with the temporary revolt of Edom hinted at in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they fetched a compass of seven days' journey.</span> The distance from Jerusalem, where the forces of Israel and Judah probably united, to the southern borders of Moab by way of Hebron, Malatha, and Thamara, which is the best-watered route, and would probably be the route taken, does not much exceed a hundred miles; but its difficulties are great, and it is quite probable that the march of an army along it would not average more than fifteen miles a day. <span class="cmt_word">And there was no water for the host.</span> The confederate army had reached the border of Moab, where they had probably expected to find water in the Wady-el-Ahsy, which is reckoned a perennial stream (Robinson, 'Researches,' vol. it. p. 488); but it was dry at the time.

As he had made no attempt to learn God's will on the subject at the mouth of any prophet, he had no ground for surprise or complaint, even had the peril been as great as he supposed. God had not "called the three kings together;" they had come together of their own accord, guided by their own views of earthly policy. Yet God was not about to "deliver them into the hands of Moab," as in strict justice he might have done. He was about to deliver the three kings from their peril.

It is impossible to say how Jehoshaphat had acquired this conviction. Elijah's selection of Elisha to be his special attendant (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>) was no doubt generally known, and may have raised expectations that Elisha would be the next great prophet. Jehoshaphat <span class="accented">may</span> have heard of the miracles recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2</a>.

Jehoram must not be allowed to suppose that he has done enough by his half-repentance and partial reformation; he must be rebuked and shamed, that he may, if possible, be led on to a better frame of mind. "What," says the prophet, "have I to do with thee? What common ground do we occupy? What is there that justifies thee in appealing to me for aid? Get thee to the prophets of thy father" - the four hundred whom Ahab gathered together at Samaria, to advise him as to going up against Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>) - "and the prophets of thy mother," the Baal-prophets, whom Jezebel, who was still alive, and held the position of queen-mother, still maintained (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19</a>) - "get thee to <span class="accented">them</span>, and consult <span class="accented">them</span>.

Even now he was engaged in an expedition which had received no Divine sanction, and was allied with two idolatrous monarchs. But Elisha condones these derelictions of duty in consideration of the king's honesty of purpose and steady attachment to Jehovah, which is witnessed to by the authors both of Kings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>) and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4-11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-5.htm">2 Chronicles 20:5-21</a>, etc.). He "regards the presence of Jehoshaphat," and therefore consents to return an answer to the three kings, and announce to them the mode of their deliverance. The adjuration wherewith he opens his speech is one of great solemnity, only used upon very special occasions (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>), and adds great force to his declaration.

What Elisha promises is a heavy storm of wind accompanied by violent rain, which, however, will be at such a distance that the Israelites will see nothing of it, but whereof they will experience the effects when the torrent-course that separates them from the Moabite country suddenly becomes a rushing stream as the rain flows off down it. Their "pits," or trenches, will retain a portion of the water, and furnish them with a sufficient supply for their wants. It was necessary that the storm should be distant, that the Moabites might know nothing of it, and so fall under the delusion (ver. 23), which led to their complete defeat. <span class="cmt_word">Yet that valley shall be filled with water.</span> Travelers tell us that, in certain circumstances, it takes but ten minutes or a quarter of an hour for a dry water-course in the East to become a raging torrent quite impassable. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the animals which you have brought with you for food - and your boasts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> your beasts of burden, or baggage-animals. Animals, except camels, suffer from drought even more than men, and die sooner. The Israelites do not appear to have ever employed camels.

But a careful examination of the passage in Deuteronomy will show <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that there is no general prohibition of the cutting down of fruit trees, but only a prohibition of their being cut down for <span class="accented">siege works</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the prohibition rests on prudential, not on moral, grounds, and is thus practically limited to cases where the conquest of the country attacked, and its occupation by the conquerors, are looked forward to. The words are, "When thou shalt besiege a city.... thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: <span class="accented">for thou mayest eat of them</span>." The destruction of the fruit trees in an enemy's country was a common feature of the wars of the period, and was largely practiced, both By the Assyrians and the Egyptians (see Layard's 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, p. 73; second series, pl. 40; 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 588; and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. pp. 5, 51, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And stop all wells of water.</span> The stoppage of springs and wells was another common practice in ancient times, often employed against enemies and aliens. The Philistines stopped the Hebrew wells in the days of Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>). Hezekiah stopped the springs of water outside Jerusalem, when he expected to be besieged By the Assyrians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4</a>). The Scythians, when Darius invaded their country, stopped all their own wells as they retired before him (Herod., 4:120). Arsaces III. partly stopped, and partly poi-ached, the Persian wells in his war with Antiochus the Great (Polyb., 10:28. &sect; 5). The practice was regarded as quite legitimate. <span class="cmt_word">And mar every good piece of land with stones</span>; literally, <span class="accented">grieve every good piece of land</span>. To clear the stones off a piece of ground was the first step towards preparing it for cultivation in the stony regions on either side of the Jordan. The clearance was generally effected by collecting the stones into heaps. When it was wished to "mar the land," the stones were there to be spread over it afresh.

The nocturnal storm had burst, not in the Moabite country, where it would have attracted the attention of the Moabites, but in some comparatively distant part of the Idumaean territory, so that the Moabites were not aware of it. Josephus says that the storm burst at a distance of three days' journey from the Israelite camp ('Ant.

But this supply was ample for the army.

A ruddy sunrise is common in the East, more especially in stormy weather (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-3.htm">Matthew 16:3</a>); and the red light, falling upon the water in the pits, and reflected thence to the opposite side of the wady, would quite sufficiently account for the mistake of the Moabites, without supposing that the water was actually stained and discolored. The Moabites concluded that the red-looking liquid was blood, from knowing that the wady was dry the day before, and from not suspecting that there had been any change in the night, as the storm which had caused the change was at such a distance.

The idea of such a mistake could scarcely have occurred to a romancer. <span class="cmt_word">The kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another.</span> There were rivalries and jealousies subsisting between Judah, Israel, and Edom, which made it quite possible that at any time open quarrel might break out among them. Edom especially was, it is probable, a reluctant member of the confederacy, forced to take her part in it by her suzerain, Jehoshaphat. The Moabites, moreover, had recently had personal experience how easily the swords of confederates might be turned against each other, since their last expedition against Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-25</a>) had completely failed through such a sudden disagreement and contention. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span> If their supposition were correct, and the kings had come to blows, and the hosts destroyed each other, Moab would have nothing to do but to fly upon the spoil, to strip the slain, and plunder the camp of the confederates. A disorderly rush took place for this purpose (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:3. &sect; 2). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/3-24.htm">2 Kings 3:24</a></div><div class="verse">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in <i>their</i> country.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up.</span> The first rush of the main body would be upon the camp, where they would expect to find the richest spoil.

There he was obliged to leave the stones untouched. Kir-haraseth, which is not mentioned among the early Moabite towns, nor even upon the Moabite Stone, and which is therefore thought to have been a newly constructed fortress (Ewald), was, in the later times, one of the most important of the strongholds of Moab (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>). It was sometimes called Kir-Moab, "the fortress of Moab." At what time it got the name of Kerak is uncertain; but we find it spoken of as Kerak-Moab by Ptolemy (about A.D. ), and by Stephen of Byzantium (about A.D. ). It was a place of much importance in the time of the Crusades. The situation is one of great strength. The fortress is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded on all sides by a deep arid narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains, rising higher than the fort itself. It is undoubtedly one of the strongest positions within the territory anciently possessed by the Moabites. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</span> Ewald thinks that by "<span class="accented">slingers"</span> are meant, not mere ordinary slingers, but persons who worked more elaborate engines, as catapults and the like ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 89, note, Eng. trans.). He is undoubtedly correct in saying that "all sorts of elaborate modes of attacking fortifications were very early known in Asia;" but it is very questionable whether the Hebrew word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) can mean anything but "slingers" in the usual sense.

A former King of Moab, when in a sore strait, had asked, "Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" (<a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>); and there is reason to believe that a chief element in the worship of Chemosh was the sacrifice of young children by their unnatural parents. The practice rested on the idea that God was best pleased when men offered to him what was dearest and most precious to them; but it was in glaring contradiction to the character of God as revealed by his prophets, and it did violence to the best and holiest instincts of human nature. The Law condemned it in the strongest terms as a profanation of the Divine Name (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-1.htm">Leviticus 20:1-5</a>), and neither Jeroboam nor Ahab ventured to introduce it when they established their idolatrous systems. The King of Mesh, undoubtedly, offered the sacrifice to his god Chemosh (see Moabite Stone, lines 3, 4, 8, 12, etc.), hoping to propitiate him, and by his aid to escape from the peril in which he found himself placed. HIS motive for offering the sacrifice <span class="cmt_word">upon the wall</span> is not so clear. It was evidently done to attract the notice of the besiegers, but with what further <span class="accented">object</span> is uncertain. Ewald thinks the king's intention was to" confound the enemy by the spectacle of the frightful deed to which they had forced him," and thus to "effect a change in their purposes" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 90); but perhaps it is as likely that he hoped to work upon their fears, and induce them to retire under the notion that, if they did not, Chemosh would do them some terrible injury. <span class="cmt_word">And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed.</span> It seems necessary to connect these clauses, and to regard them as assigning cause and effect. The deed done aroused an indignation against Israel, which led to the siege being raised. But an indignation on whose part? Keil thinks, on God's. But could God be angry with Israel for an act of the King of Moab, which they had no ground for anticipating, and which they could not possibly have pro-vented? especially when the Israelites had done nothing to cause the act, except by carrying out God's own command to them through his prophet, to "smite every fenced city and every choice city" (ver. 19). The indignation, therefore, must have been human. But who felt it? Probably the Moabites. The terrible act of their king, to which they considered that Israel had driven him, stirred up such a feeling of fury among the residue of the Moabite nation, that the confederates quailed before it, and came to the conclusion that they had best give up the siege and retire. They therefore departed from him - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the King of Mesh - and returned to their own land; severally to Edom, Judea, and Samaria. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_kings/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Kings 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Kings 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_kings/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Kings 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Kings 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
