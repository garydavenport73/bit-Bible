Many of the bottles are earlier than the time of Elisha. <span class="cmt_word">In thine hand, and go to Ramoth-Gilead.</span> Ramoth-Gilead lay across the Jordan, in the proper territory of Gad. It had been seized and occupied by the Syrians in the reign of Ahab; and the possession had been maintained till recently. Joram, however, had recovered it (Josephus, 'Ant.

Elijah had been bidden to anoint him king, but apparently had neglected to do so, or rather had devolved the task upon his successor. Meantime Jehu served as a soldier under Ahaziah and Jehoram, Ahab's sons, and attained such distinction that he became one of the captains of the host (<span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 5), according to Josephus (<span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.) the chief captain. Jehu was commonly known as "the son of Nimshi" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-20.htm">2 Kings 9:20</a>), either because, his father having died young, he was brought up by his grandfather, or perhaps simply "because Nimshi was a person of more importance than Jehoshaphat." <span class="cmt_word">And go in</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seek his presence, go into his quarters, wherever they may be, have direct speech with him - <span class="cmt_word">and make him arise up from among his brethren</span> (comp. vers. 5 and 6).

I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel; literally, <span class="accented">over the people of Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">over Israel</span>. Practically, the people is, in the main, "the people of Baal" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19-21</a>), but theoretically and by covenant it is "the people of Jehovah" - his "peculiar people" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), chosen by him out of all the nations of the earth to be his own. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-7.htm">2 Kings 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master.</span> This is plainly a command, not a prophecy. Jehu is expressly ordered by God to "smite," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> destroy utterly, the whole house of Ahab. This command he carried out (vers. 24, 33; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1-11</a>); and his obedience to it obtained for him the temporal reward that his children to the fourth generation should sit on the throne of Israel (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). Yet still his conduct in destroying the house of Ahab is spoken of by the Prophet Hosea as a sin, and God declares, by Hosea's mouth, that he will "avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu" (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>). It is naturally asked - "How could Jehu's shedding this blood, at God's command and in fulfillment of his will, be a sin?" And it is rightly answered, "Because, if we do what is the will of God for any end of our own, for anything except God, we do in fact our own will, not God's. It was not lawful for Jehu to depose and slay the king his master, except at the express command of God, <span class="accented">who</span>, as the supreme King, sets up and puts down earthly rulers as he wills. For any other end, and done otherwise than at God's express command, such an act is sin. Jehu was rewarded for the measure in which he fulfilled God's commands, as Ahab, 'who had sold himself to work wickedness,' had yet a temporal reward for humbling himself publicly, when rebuked by God for his sin, and so honoring God, amid an apostate people. But Jehu, by cleaving, against the will of God, to Jeroboam's sin (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29, 31</a>), which served his own political ends, showed that, in the slaughter of his master, he acted, not as he pretended, out of zeal for the will of God (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a>), but served his own will and his own ambition only. By his disobedience to the one command of God, he showed that he would have equally disobeyed the other, had it been contrary to his own will or interest. He <span class="accented">had no principle of obedience</span>. And so the blood which was shed according to the righteous judgment of God, became sin to him that shed it in order to fulfill, not the will of God, but his own" (see Dr. Pusey's 'Minor Prophets, with a Commentary,' p. 9, col. 1). <span class="cmt_word">That I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets.</span> Comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a> and 1 Kings 19:14.

At the hand of Jezebel. Jezebel was at the bottom of all the persecutions. Sometimes she took matters into her own hands, gave her own orders, and saw them carried out (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8-14</a>).

The far greater sin of Ahab could not be visited with less severity. <span class="cmt_word">And like the house of Baasha the Son of Ahijah.</span> As the whole house of Jeroboam had been cut off for its idolatries, so the house of Baasha, which succeeded to the throne, was removed even more speedily, Baasha himself and all his posterity being swept from the earth by. Zimri, who "smote him and killed him," and succeeded him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-11.htm">1 Kings 16:11</a>). The house of Ahab had had a double warning of the fate in reserve for those who deserted the religion of Jehovah, but had disregarded both warnings alike, and had provoked God yet more than their predecessors, by introducing a novel and degraded form of idolatrous worship.

To an Israelite, and even to a Phoenician, it was an awful threat; for both nations alike buried their dead carefully in deep-dug graves or rocky receptacles, and both regarded the desecration of a corpse as a grievous calamity ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. pp. 112,114). The dog was to the Hebrews, and to the Orientals generally, an unclean animal, and to be devoured by dogs would have been viewed as a fate which, for a queen, was almost inconceivable. <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be none to bury her.</span> Jezebel had no one sufficiently interested in her fate to watch over her remains. Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, had kept watch over the bodies of the seven sons of Saul, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>); and in Greece, if we may believe the poets, life had been risked, and actually forfeited, to save a near relative from similar ignominy (Soph., 'Ant.,' lines 245-743). But "Jezebel had none to bury her." When she was ejected from the palace window (ver. 33) and fell to the ground, and was trodden under foot by Jehu's chariot-horses, no one came forth from the palace to give the bruised and wounded corpse such tendance as was possible. There was entire neglect of the body for (probably) some hours; and, during these, the catastrophe occurred which Divine foresight had prophesied, but which human malice had not intended (see vers. 34-37). <span class="cmt_word">And he opened the door, and fled.</span> The young man the prophet obeyed to the letter the injunctions which Elisha had given him (ver. 3).

Secrecy was absolutely essential. If the revolt had got wind - and a single messenger might have carried the news - the whole attempt might have failed, or only have succeeded after a long and bloody civil war. All John's efforts were bent on keeping his revolt secret until he himself announced it to the astonished king (see ver. 22).

Jehu, with a moderate troop or company (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>), sets out, perhaps on the very day of his enthronement, and hastens with all speed to Jezreel, bent on arriving there before any suspicion has arisen of revolt or rebellion. His great object was to surprise Joram, and to kill or capture him before he could take any steps to organize a defense. Probably the force which accompanied him was wholly a chariot force. <span class="cmt_word">And Ahaziah King of Judah was come down to see Joram</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-29.htm">2 Kings 8:29</a>, and the comment A.D. loc). Ahaziah, it must be remembered, was Joram's nephew, as well as his ally in the war against Syria. It was natural that he should visit his uncle when he was wounded, even if the wounds were not very serious.

If the "company" had been a band of Syrians, or other enemies, coming in hostile fashion, the watchman would have worded his warning differently. The king probably concluded that he was about to receive tidings from the seat of war, and meant to ask, "Is the news good or bad - peaceful or the contrary?"

"What does it matter to such a one as thee, a mere common man, whether my tidings are peaceful or the contrary? I shall not tell thee my errand. Turn and follow in my train." The messenger had no choice but to obey.

Ahaziah probably accompanied him out of politeness, though he too may have been curious to learn the news.

The "portion of Naboth," or his plot of ground, lay outside the southeastern gate of the city, at no great distance from the walls; and it happened that Joram and Jehu met within its limits. Had the king started a little sooner, or had Jehu made less haste, the meeting would have taken place further from the town, and outside the "portion of Naboth." But Divine providence so ordered matters that vengeance for the sin of Ahab was exacted upon the very scene of his guilt, and a prophecy made, probably by Elisha, years previously, and treasured up in the memory of Jehu (ver. 26), was fulfilled to the letter.

Something in the aspect of Jehu, and in his furious haste, may by this time have alarmed the king. Or possibly he maybe merely repeating the question put through his messengers, and still unanswered, Is all well with the army or no? Has there been any disaster?" Jehu, at any rate, chooses to understand his vague phrase in the former sense, as if he had asked, "Is it peace between thee and me?" and answers in the negative. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witch-crafts are so many?</span> literally, <span class="accented">so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and those many witchcrafts of hers continue</span>.

Besides the Baal-worship, Jezebel had introduced these unhallowed practices into the kingdom of Israel. Jehu reproaches Joram with allowing them, and declares that there can be no peace between him and his master under ouch circumstances. Having gained his object and got within bowshot of the unsuspecting monarch, he throws off the mask and declares uncompromising hostility.

Jehu recalls his captain's recollection to an occurrence which was deeply impressed upon his own. "When thou and I rode together after Ahab" probably means "when we two stood behind Ahab in his chariot." The Assyrian sculptures usually represent the monarch as attended by two body-guards, who ride in the same chariot with him, standing up behind him, and often interposing their shields to protect his person. In this near proximity Jehu and Bidkar would hear any speech which was addressed to Ahab.

In this case "Beth-Gan" would be a village or town, probably identical with En-gannim, which lay at the foot of the hills bounding the Plain of Esdraelon, nearly due south of Jezreel (Zerin), and which is now known as Jenin (see the Map of Western Palestine, by Mr. Trelawney Saunders, compiled from the surveys of the Palestine Exploration Fund, where Ahaziah's flight is well traced. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu followed after him; and said, Smite him also in the chariot</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in his chariot</span>, not in that of Jehoram, since the two kings rode respectively in their own chariots (ver. 21). It was a bold step in a pretender not yet settled upon the throne to provoke the hostility of a neighboring country by murdering its monarch; but Jehu probably thought he had more to fear from Ahaziah himself, who had been on such close terms of friendship with Jehoram, than from any probable successors. He, therefore, finding him in his power, pursued after him and slew him. From a religious point of view he could justify the act; since the commission given to him (ver. 7) was to smite all the house of Ahab, and Ahaziah was Ahab's grandson. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.

The reconciliation of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-8.htm">2 Chronicles 12:8, 9</a> with the present passage is difficult, but not wholly impossible.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a></div><div class="verse">And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <i>of it</i>; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jehu was come to Jezreel.</span> Some commentators suppose that Jehu did not engage personally in the pursuit of Ahaziah, but, leaving that to a portion of his retinue, pushed on with all haste to Jezreel, where Jezebel was, "the originator of all the mischief." But it is certainly more natural to understand (with Keil and Josephus) that Jehu himself pursued. The pursuit to Ibleam, where Ahaziah was mortally wounded, and the return to Jezreel, need not have occupied more than about three hours. <span class="cmt_word">Jezebel heard of it.</span> She would naturally be the first to hear. On the death of her son, which must have been plainly seen from the walls of Jezreel, she become practically the chief authority in the place, and indeed in the kingdom. Jehoram's sons were probably minors. <span class="cmt_word">And she painted her face</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and she put her eyes in antimony</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she adorned her eyes with the dark dye which has always been fashionable in the East, and which is still used at the present day. The dye is spread both on the upper and the lower eyelids. It at once increases the apparent size of the eye, and gives it unnatural brilliancy. The Oriental nations, Babylonians, Assyrians, Medes, Persians, were acquainted with the practice from very early times; and it is not surprising that it was known to Jezebel. What was her exact object in applying it is more doubtful. The older commentators, who are followed by Ewald, suppose that she intended to "summon up all her seductive fascinations in order to tempt and conquer Jehu;" but more recent writers (Bahr, Keil, and others) argue that her probable age renders this incredible, since she had already a grandson who was twenty-three years of age (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), and must therefore have been herself at least fifty. But, if we remember that Cleopatra was forty when She held Antony as her slave and hoped to captivate Augustus, it would seem to be not altogether beyond the bounds of possibility that a Phoouician princess of fifty may have thought that, by the use of art, she might reader herself a captivating personage. There is, at any rate no evidence that "putting the eyes in antimony" was an ordinary or a fitting preparation for meeting death in a way worthy of a queen. Ewald's view has, therefore much to commend it to our acceptance. Jezebel, trusting in the charms and the fascination which had been so potent over Ahab, may have imagined that she had still enough beauty left to capture Jehu, provided she increased her natural attractions by a careful use of all the resources of art. <span class="cmt_word">And tired her head.</span> Phoenician statues of goddesses have their hair arranged in long pendent curls, and bear on their heads a small conical cap with a ribbon wreathed round the base. The artists probably had queens and princesses as their models. There is no evidence that false hair was worn in Phoenicia, either by men or women. <span class="cmt_word">And looked out at a window.</span> Windows, sometimes open, sometimes latticed, were common in Oriental houses from the earliest times. They mostly looked into the court round which a house was commonly built; but some few were in the external wall of the building; and through these new arrivals might be reconnoitered. Jezebel "looked out," partly to see, but perhaps still more to be seen. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a></div><div class="verse">And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, <i>Had</i> Zimri peace, who slew his master?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</span> This is a possible meaning of Jezebel's words, and it has among its advocates - Luther, De Wette, Maurer, and Dathe, besides our own translators. But so defiant an utterance is quite incompatible within intention to captivate and conciliate. Probably, therefore, we should understand the queen either as saying affirmatively, "Peace to thee, Zimri!" (or, "Hail, Zimri!") "slayer of thy lord," or else as asking, "Is it peace" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Is it peace now between thee and me?"), Zimri, slayer of thy lord?" In either case, Zimri is an honorific appellation, recalling the fact of another Israelite general, who had revolted, slain his master, and reigned as king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-32.htm">2 Kings 9:32</a></div><div class="verse">And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who <i>is</i> on my side? who? And there looked out to him two <i>or</i> three eunuchs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who?</span> Whatever Jezebel's intention, Jehu yielded not a jot; he was deaf to her flatteries, blind to her seductions. He had made up his mind for "war to the knife" before he embarked upon his enterprise, and the feeble attempts of a queen whose part was played out, whose age he knew, and whom he no doubt regarded as an old woman, had no power on him. Instead of responding to her blandishments, he took a stern and hard line. He would not see her privately. He summoned to his aid the menials of the palace - the eunuchs -those on whom beauty has least influence. "Who is on my side? <span class="accented">who</span>?" he exclaimed (literally, "Who is with me? who?"); thus calling on the court servants to desert their masters, the guards to turn their swords against their employers, the menials to consummate an intra-palatial revolution. We cannot deny to Jehu the credit of vigor, promptness, audacity, the talent to seize on the opportunity of the moment, and to make the most of it; but he must ever present himself to us as the rough soldier, with no courtesy, with no chivalry, bent on accomplishing his own ends, and shrinking from no deed of blood, no precedent <span class="accented">pessimi exempli</span>, if thereby his ends might be brought about. <span class="cmt_word">And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</span> Eunuchs had become an integral part both of the Jewish and of the Israelite courts from the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>). They are an institution which almost necessarily accompanies polygamy; and they had long held high office in. Egypt, in Babylon, and in Assyria. A position outside nature, at variance with all men's natural feelings and aspirations, of necessity depraves the character, weakens the moral principle, and ends by debasing the class. In Oriental history, the lowest, vilest part is always played by the eunuchs of the palace, who are ever ready to take part in any intrigues, in any conspiracies, and who seem to be almost wholly devoid of the ordinary feelings of humanity. The eunuchs who "looked out" to Jehu were probably the <span class="accented">chief</span> eunuchs of the palace, who had authority over the others, and indeed over the court officials generally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-33.htm">2 Kings 9:33</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and <i>some</i> of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Throw her down.</span> A splendid example of the wicked man's prompt and bold and unscrupulous decision. A queen, a queen-mother, always more tenderly regarded than an ordinary queen-regnant, a princess in her own right (see ver. 34), daughter of a neighboring and powerful potentate, settled in her kingdom for over thirty years, the most powerful person the state during that entire period, backed up by the numerous and dominant party of her co-religionists, she is to Jehu nothing but a wicked woman who is in his way; she inspires him with no awe, she does not even touch him with any feeling of respect. "Throw her down." History presents no parallel to such an indignity. Kings and queens had been, time after time, removed by violence; their lives had been taken; they had been transplanted to another sphere of being. But the open casting forth from a window of a crowned head by the menials of the court, at the command of a usurper, was a new thing, unprecedented, unparalleled. It must have been a shock to all established notions of propriety. In commanding it Jehu showed his superiority to existing prejudice, his utter fearlessness, and his willingness to create a new precedent, which might seriously shake the monarchical principle. <span class="cmt_word">So they threw her down.</span> There appears to have been no hesitation. The boldness of Jehu communicated itself to those whom he addressed; and the eunuchs violently seized the person of the queen, and precipitated her from the window to the ground below. She fell on the road by which the palace was approached, and lay there bleeding and helpless. <span class="cmt_word">And some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall.</span> As she fell, some portion of her body struck against the wall of the palace, and left splashes of blood upon it. There were probably some projections from the wall between the window and the ground. <span class="cmt_word">And on the horses.</span> As her body struck the projections, a bloody shower spurted from it, which fell in part upon the horses that drew Jehu's chariot. <span class="cmt_word">And he trode her underfoot.</span> Like Tullia (Liv, 1:48), Jehu had his chariot driven over the prostrate corpse, so that the hoofs of his horses, and perhaps his own person, were sprinkled with the royal blood. Compare the passage of Livy, "Amens, agi-tantibus furiis, Tullia per patris corpus carpentum egisse fertur, partemque sanguinis ac caedis paternae cruento vehiculo, contaminata ipsa respersaque, tutisse ad penates suos virique sui." It is not often that royal corpses, unless in the heat of battle, have received such treatment.

Not till afterwards did he bethink himself of the bloody corpse of his late queen and mistress, lying on the cold ground uncared for and untended, exposed to scorn and ignominy. When the thought occurred to him, it brought about a certain amount of relenting. <span class="cmt_word">Go, see now this cursed woman.</span> He calls Jezebel, "a cursed woman," not inappropriately. She had brought a curse on her husband, on her sons, and on her grandsons; she had been the evil genius of two countries, Israel and Judah; she had been the prime mover in a bloody persecution of the worshippers of Jehovah; and was the true original source of the present revolution, which was to result in the deaths of so many others. <span class="cmt_word">And bury her: for she is a king's daughter.</span> As queen-mother, Jehu, it seems, would not have regarded Jezebel as entitled to burial; but as daughter of Eth-Baal, King of the Zidonians (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>), and so a princess born, he allowed her claim. Perhaps he feared lest further insult to the corpse might provoke the resentment of the Phoenician monarch, and draw down upon him that prince's hostility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a></div><div class="verse">And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of <i>her</i> hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</span> "The harder parts of the human frame" (Stanley); perhaps also the less palatable, since cannibals say that the palm of the human hand is excessively bitter. Dogs in Oriental countries are ever prowling about, especially in the vicinity of towns, on the lookout for food, and will eat flesh or offal of any kind. They have been called "the scavengers of the East," and the phrase well describes them. Dean Stanley saw "the wild dogs of Jezreel prowling about the mounds where the offal is cast outside the gates of the town by the inhabitants."

The narrative woke another chord of memory which had hitherto slept. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The prophecy referred to is doubtless that recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>. It is, however, here expanded, either because Jehu's recollection was not exact, or because the record in 1 Kings is abbreviated. The great point of the prophecy is common to both records, viz. that the dogs should eat Jezebel at Jezreel, on the scene of her iniquities. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.</span> It is not quite clear what is meant by the portion (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span>) of Jezreel. Probably there is no allusion to the "portion" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of Naboth (vers. 25, 26).
