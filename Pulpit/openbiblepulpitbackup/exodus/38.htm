This interesting fact has not been previously mentioned. Bronze plates, circular or oval, admitting of a high polish, were used by the Egyptian women as mirrors from a very early date, and may be seen in the Egyptian collection of the British Museum. They have handles like those of our fire-screens, generally also of bronze. It was natural that the Hebrew women should possess similar articles, and should have taken care to bring them with them out of Egypt. The sacrifice of them for a sacred purpose is rather to be ascribed to their own serf-denying piety than to any command issued by Moses (Spencer). <span class="cmt_word">Which assembled</span>. Literally, "who came by troops." Women assembled themselves by troops at the entrance of the "tent of meeting" set up lay. Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>), as at a later date we find Hannah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9-12</a>) and other women who were less worthy (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>) doing. The women who showed this zeal were those that made the sacrifice of their mirrors for God's service. There is no reason to suppose (with Hengstenberg and others) that they constituted a regular "order."

Before dismissing the subject of the construction of the tabernacle, Moses places on record the sum of the gold, silver and bronze contributed and consumed in the work. At the same time he informs us who was the accountant by whom the sum was made up (ver. 21), and what were the portions of the work formed of each metal (vers. 24, 27, 28, 30, 31). Incidentally he mentions the number of the congregation at this period (ver. 26), and the weight of the "sockets" or "bases" (ver. 27). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the sum</span>.

The value of the gold has been estimated by Canon Cook at &pound;175,075 13s. 0d. of our money; by Thenius at 877,300 Prussian thalers, or about &pound;131,595. It was certainly under &pound;200,000. De Wette and others have argued that the possession of so large a sum in gold at this time by the Hebrew nation is inconceivable. But most critics are of a different opinion. Gold was very abundant in Egypt at the period, being imported from Ethiopia, a rich gold-producing country (Herod. 3:23; Diod. Sic. 3:11), as well as taken in tribute from the nations of Asia. The wealth of Rhampsinitus (Rameses III.), a little later than the exodus, was enormous (Herod. 2:121; Rawlinson, <span class="accented">History of Egypt</span>, vol. 2. pp. 368, 378). According to the preceding narrative (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35, 36</a>) much of the wealth of Egypt had, at the moment of their quitting the country, passed from the Egyptians to the Hebrews. If they numbered two millions of souls, their gold ornaments are likely to have been worth very much more than &pound;200,000 of our money. On <span class="cmt_word">the shekel of the sanctuary</span>, see the comment upon <a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25</a></div><div class="verse">And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation <i>was</i> an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The silver</span>. The silver seems to have amounted to about four times the weight of the gold; but the value of it was very much less, not exceeding &pound;40,000 of our money (Cook). It may seem surprising that this should have been so; but there are grounds for believing that both in Africa and in Asia gold was more plentiful than silver in the early ages. And it is certainly much more suitable for ornaments. <span class="cmt_word">Of them that were numbered</span>. See above, <a href="../../par/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>. The silver for the sanctuary was collected by a compulsory tax, of the nature of a church-rate. This produced the amount here given, No estimate is made of the weight of the silver freewill offerings (<a href="../../par/exodus/35-24.htm">Exodus 35:24</a>), nor is any account given of their application. It has been suggested that they were returned to the donors as superfluous, which is certainly possible,
