Bezaleel and Aholiab felt that the time for action was now come. They at once addressed themselves to their task. Moses delivered into their hands all the various offerings which the people, rich and poor, had brought in (<a href="../../par/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21-29</a>); and skilled workmen were immediately called upon to shape it for the designed uses. The fact of the work being commenced did not stop the inflow of gifts. More and yet more continued to be brought "every morning" (ver. 3). At last it became clear that the supply had exceeded the demand; and the workmen reported so to Moses (vers. 4, 5), who thereupon commanded that the offerings should cease (ver. 6). The progress of the work is then reported in detail, and in the following order: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The covering for the tabernacle (vers. 8-13); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The goats' hair covering for the tent above the tabernacle (vers. 14-18); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The outer coverings of rams' skins and seals' skins (ver. 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The boards for the walls of the tabernacle (vers. 20-30); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The bars for the boards (vers. 31-34); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The veil of the most holy place (vers. 35, 30); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> The hanging for the entrance to the tabernacle (vers. 37, 38). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The chapter, from ver. 8, runs parallel with ch. 26, differing from it mainly in describing as made that which in ch. 26. is ordered to be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then wrought Bezaleel,</span> etc. This is introductory to the entire sub-section, which extends to the end of ch. 39. It means - "Then, under the direction of Bezaleel and Aholiab, began the work of constructing that place of meeting for which commandment had been given to Moses in the mount." The master-craftsmen, and those under them, "wrought," and took care that all was done <span class="cmt_word">according to all that the Lord had commanded.</span> It is to mark the exactitude of the obedience that chs. 36. - 39, follow so closely, and with such minuteness, the wording of chs. 26. - 28.
