There was encouragement in the very word "now." Moses' complaint was, that God delayed his coming, would not show himself, was "slack concerning his promise." In reply he is told that there is to be no longer any delay - the work is just about to commence. "Now shalt thou see." <span class="cmt_word">With a strong hand shall he let them go</span>. The "strong hand" is not Pharaoh's, but God's. "By means of my strong hand" (or "overpowering might") "laid upon him shall he be induced to let them go," and similarly with the other clause. <span class="cmt_word">Drive them out</span>. This phrase well expresses the final anxiety of Pharaoh to be rid of the Israelites. (See <a href="../../par/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31, 22</a>.)

The promise of the first verse was, apparently, given first, and was quite distinct from all the others - perhaps separated from them by an interval of hours, or days. It was especially addressed to Moses. The rest was in the main (ver. 6-8) a message to the people. <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord</span>. Or, "I am JEHOVAH." Compare 3:15, and note <span class="accented">ad loc.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by <i>the name of</i> God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty</span>. See <a href="../../par/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a> for the revelation of this name to Abraham, and <a href="../../par/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a> for its repetition to Jacob. We do not find the full name used by God in any appearance to Isaac; but Isaac himself uses it in <a href="../../par/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">By my name Jehovah was</span>  <span class="cmt_word">I not known unto them</span>. The explanation of this passage is by no means easy. God himself, according to <a href="../../par/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>, revealed himself to Abraham as Jehovah before declaring his name to be El-Shaddai (God Almighty); and again revealed himself to Jacob as Jehovah-Elohim (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>). Abraham named the place where he had been about to sacrifice Isaac, "Jehovah-jireh" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>). That Moses regarded the name as known even earlier, appears from <a href="../../par/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>. It was probably as old as language. The apparent meaning of the present passage cannot therefore be its true meaning. No writer would so contradict himself. Perhaps the true sense is, "I was known to them as a Being of might and power, not as mere absolute (and so eternal and immutable) existence." This meaning of the word, though its etymological and original meaning, may have been unknown to the patriarchs, who were not etymologists. It was first distinctly declared to Moses at Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14, 15</a>).

It was this larger tract which was promised by God to Abraham. <span class="cmt_word">The land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers</span>. Literally, "the land of their sojourns wherein they sojourned." (So Kalisch.) It was by permission of the lords of the soil - the Canaaaites, Perizzites, Hittites, and others, that Abraham and his descendants dwelt in Canaan to the time of Jacob's descent into Egypt. (See <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>, etc.)

Compare <a href="../../par/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a> and Exodus 3:9. The repetition is in consequence of Moses' expostulation (<a href="../../par/exodus/5-22.htm">Exodus 5:22, 23</a>), and is to assure the Israelites that God has not forgotten them, but will sustain them under their afflictions, and will shortly deliver them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I <i>am</i> the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say unto the children of Israel</span>. God felt for the disappointment which the people had suffered in finding no alleviation of their toils, but the reverse, after their hopes had been raised high by the words of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>). He therefore sent them an inspiriting and gracious message. "They <span class="accented">should</span> be rid of their bondage; they <span class="accented">should</span> be brought out; they <span class="accented">should</span> be redeemed and delivered by his mighty arm and miraculous intervention. He, Jehovah, had said it." Faith would lay hold on this assurance and cling to it, even though God still delayed his coming, and did not precipitate matters. <span class="cmt_word">A stretched-out arm</span>. Arms are stretched out by men to help and save. An outstretched arm in the Egyptian writing meant "action." The phrase, elsewhere so common, is here used for the first time. (Compare, however, <a href="../../par/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>.) It was significant of active, energetic help. <span class="cmt_word">Great judgments</span>. These had been previously hinted at (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a> and <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>) but had not been previously called "judgments." Compare <a href="../../par/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>: "Also that nation whom they serve will I judge." The plagues of Egypt were not merely "wonders," but punishments inflicted on a proud and cruel nation by a Judge.

They had evidence that it was he who brought them forth in the pillar of fire and of a cloud (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19, 20</a>, etc.). They were brought into the promised land by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>), and given the full possession of it by him and his successors  - the various judges and kings, until at last, under David and Solomon, they held the entire tract that had been promised to Abraham (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>).

God's faithfulness is pledged to the performance of the terms of the covenant on his part. I will give it you for an heritage: I am the Lord. Rather, "I will give it you for an heritage, I the Lord" (or "I Jehovah," or "I the Eternal One"). "You have the pledge of my Eternity and Immutability that it shall be yours." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:9 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-9.htm">Exodus 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. The Israelites, who had expected a speedy deliverance, and found themselves only the more down-trodden for Moses' interference, were too much dispirited to be cheered even by the gracious promises and assurances which Moses was commissioned to give. They had no longer any trust in one who they thought had deceived them. He was a dreamer, a visionary, if no worse. They did not intend hearkening to him any more. "Anguish of spirit" possessed their souls, and "cruel bondage" claimed their bodies, day after day. They had not even the time, had they had the will, to hearken. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Anguish of spirit</span>. Literally, "shortness." Compare <a href="../../par/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>. Their spirit was shortened - they had lost all heart, as we say, so cruel had been their disappointment. The contrast between their feelings now, and when Moses first addressed them (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>), is strong, but "fully accounted for by the change of circumstances". (Cook). Cruel bondage. Bondage, <span class="accented">i.e</span>., far more oppressive and continuous than. it had been (<a href="../../par/exodus/5-9.htm">Exodus 5:9-14</a>). The Samaritan version adds: "And they said to him, Let us alone, and let us serve the Egyptians; for it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than die in a wilderness," an addition which receives some support from <a href="../../par/exodus/14-12.htm">Exodus 14:12</a>.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:10-12

He is to enter into his presence once more, and demand, without circumlocution or obscurity, that the Israelites be allowed to quit the land (ver. 11). Moses, however, demurs. He had done God's will with respect to the people readily and at once, expecting <span class="accented">that</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> he had persuaded them before, so he would a second time. But he had been disappointed; the people had refused to listen to him. Immediately all his original self-distrust and diffidence recurred - even the old form of diffidence, distrust of his ability to persuade men (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>). How shall he expect to persuade Pharaoh, who had already rejected him (<a href="../../par/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2-5</a>), when he bad just failed with his own countrymen, who previously had "believed" his report (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>)?

Note the advance in the demand. No longer is there any limitation to a three days' journey, as at first (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>). The children of Israel are to be let go altogether "out of the land." So generally, if God lays a light burthen upon us and we refuse it, we may expect him to exchange our light burthen for a heavier one. We had better accept the first cross he offers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-12.htm">Exodus 6:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised lips</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "lips inefficient for the purpose for which lips are given;" as "uncircumcised ears" are ears that cannot hearken (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-10.htm">Jeremiah 6:10</a>), and an "uncircumcised heart" a heart that cannot understand (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>). The meaning is the same as in <a href="../../par/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10</a>, where Moses says that he is "slow of speech and of a slow tongue." Nothing can be determined from the expression as to the exact cause of the imperfection of which complaint is made.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:13-27

The whole political system of Israel was based upon the tribal relation; and it was of the last importance, politically, to hand down the divisions and subdivisions of families. The lists here given, probably prepared by Moses in a separate document, had to be inserted somewhere. The present seemed a fitting place. The narrative had reached a turning-point. All the preliminaries were over - the action of the Exodus itself was about to begin. A dramatist would have made <a href="../../par/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>. end and <a href="../../par/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> commence. A poet would have begun a new canto. In the imperfect bibliography of the time, it was thought best to make a division by a parenthetic insertion. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13</span> seems to belong to what follows rather than to what precedes. There is no emphasis on the words <span class="cmt_word">and to Aaron</span>, as if God, having found Moses singly to be irre-sponsive, had now given a charge to both the brothers conjointly (Rashi). Rather the verse is a concise summary of chs. 3-5, prefixed to the genealogy when it was a separate document, and preserved when the compiler placed the document in the text

The main families of the tribe of Reuben were those of Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carrel, actual sons of the patriarch (See <a href="../../par/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; and compare <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>.)

In both the latter places Jemuel appears as Nemuel, and Zohar as Zerah, while Obad is omitted. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>, Jachin appears as Jarib. It would seem that the family of Obad died out and disappeared soon after the Israelites quitted Egypt. The family of Shaul, on the other hand, increased and multiplied (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-25.htm">1 Chronicles 4:25-27</a>).

This phrase is introduced because the writer does not here stop at the sons, but proceeds on to the grandsons, great-grandsons, and other descendants. (See vers. 17-25.) He is concerned especially in this place with the descent of Moses, and therefore with the genealogy of the tribe of Levi, and has only inserted any account of the families descended from Reuben and Simeon, that he might not seem to disregard the claims of primogeniture. <span class="cmt_word">The years of the life of Levi</span>. These began about forty or fifty years before the descent into Egypt, which took place after the birth of all his three sons, as appears front <a href="../../par/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8-11</a>. The length of Levi's life is recorded, not from any chronological considerations, but to show God's blessing upon the family of Moses, which gave such length of days to so many of his ancestors.

Kohath, who was probably about twenty at the time of the descent into Egypt, must have considerably outlived Joseph, who died about seventy years after the descent. His eldest son, Amram, is not likely to have been born much later than his father's thirtieth year. (See <a href="../../par/genesis/11-12.htm">Genesis 11:12-24</a>.)

That this Amram is the "man of the house of Levi" mentioned in <a href="../../par/exodus/2-1.htm">Exodus 2:1</a>, cannot be doubted; but it is scarcely possible that he should be the Amram of ver. 18, the actual son of Kohath and contemporary of Joseph. He is probably a descendant of the sixth or seventh generation, who bore the same name, and was the head of the Amramite house. That house, at the time of the Exodus, numbered above two thousand males (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-27.htm">Numbers 3:27, 28</a>). See the excellent  remarks of Keil and Delitzsch, 'Biblical Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 470, E. T.; and compare Kurtz, 'History of Old Covenant,' vol. 2. p. 144, and Cook, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 274. <span class="cmt_word">Jochebed his father's sister</span>. Marriages with aunts and nieces have been common in many countries, and are not forbidden by any natural instinct. They first became unlawful by the positive command recorded in <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-12.htm">Leviticus 18:12</a>. The name Jochebed is the earliest known compounded with Jah, or Jehovah. It means "the glory of Jehovah." <span class="cmt_word">She bare him Aaron and Moses</span>. Aaron is placed first, as being older than Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7</a>). Miriam is omitted, since the object of the writer is confined to tracing descent in the male line.

Korah is mentioned as a "son (descendant) of Izhar" in <a href="../../par/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-38.htm">1 Chronicles 6:38</a>. The other "sons" are not elsewhere mentioned. Zithri in this verse should be Zichri.

Mishael and Elzaphan are again mentioned as "sons of Uzziel" in <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>. They were employed by Moses to carry the bodies of Nadab and Abihu out of the camp. Elzaphan, called Elizaphan, is mentioned as head of the Ko-hathites in <a href="../../par/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30</a>.

Amminadah had not been previously mentioned. He was a descendant of Judah, through Pharez and Hezron, and held a place in the line of our Lord's ancestry.
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-24.htm">Exodus 6:24</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these <i>are</i> the families of the Korhites.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Korah</span>. All Korah's sons were not cut off with him (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-11.htm">Numbers 26:11</a>). Three at least survived, and became the heads of "families of the Korhites."

Putiel is not elsewhere mentioned. The name is thought to be half Egyptian (compare Poti-phar) and to mean "dedicated to God." She bare him Phinehas. This Phinehas became high priest on the death of Eleazar (<a href="../../par/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>).

As the heading of the document was kept upon its insertion into the narrative of the Exodus (see the comment on ver. 13), so its concluding sentences were kept, though (according to modern ideas) superfluous. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to their armies</span>. The term "armies" had not been previously used of the Israelitish people; but it occurs in <a href="../../par/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4</a>, which was probably in the mind of the writer who drew up the genealogy <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 6:28-30

The author, or compiler, having interposed his genealogical section, has to take up the narrative from verse 12, where he broke off, and does so by almost repeating the words of verses 10-12. The only important addition is the insertion of the words  - "I am the Lord" (ver. 29), and the only important variation, the substitution of "Speak thou unto Pharaoh <span class="accented">all that I say unto thee'</span> (ibid.), for "Speak unto Pharaoh... that he let the children of Israel go out of his land" (ver. 11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-29.htm">Exodus 6:29</a></div><div class="verse">That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I <i>am</i> the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord.</span> It is not improbable that every revelation made to Moses was authenticated by these initial words - which have the force of that initial phrase, so constant in the later prophets - "Thus saith the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/exodus/6-30.htm">Exodus 6:30</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I <i>am</i> of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that I say unto thee</span>. To the general command thus expressed, was probably appended the particular injunction of verse 11, not here repeated -  Speak thou unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land."
