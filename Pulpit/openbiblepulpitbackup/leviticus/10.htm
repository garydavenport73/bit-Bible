In chapter Leviticus 16:12 it is ordered that, on the Day of Atonement, the incense fire should be taken from the brazen altar, and this was no doubt the rule on all occasions, though the law has not been recorded.

The lightning flash which had struck them down had not injured their clothes. As Mishael and Elzaphan became ceremonially defiled by contact with the corpses, and as the Passover was now at hand, it has been thought that it was in reference to their case that the concession was made, that those d, filed by a dead body might keep the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second instead of the first month (<a href="../../par/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-11</a>). The defilement caused by death ceased when Christ had died.

They had now been in the court for eight days continuously, and they had to remain there until, in the fulfillment of their public function, they had eaten the sacrificial meal. Cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-21.htm">Matthew 8:21, 22</a>, "Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto him, Follow me." God's service comes before all things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 10:8-20 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/10-8.htm">Leviticus 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</div><div class="comm"> TO ABSTAIN FROM WINE (verses 8-11). The law given to Aaron (some manuscripts read Moses) against the use of wine by the priests during their ministrations, by its juxtaposition with what has gone before, has led to the probable supposition that Nadab and Abihu had acted under the excitement of intoxicating drink. It is possible that the sacrificial meals on the peace offerings had begun, and that at the same time that the congregation was feasting, the two priests had refreshed themselves with wine after their long service. The special ceremonial meal of the priests had not yet been eaten.
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: <i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations:</div><div class="comm">

Nadab and Abihu, on the contrary, had not distinguished between the sacred and profane fire, or between God's commands and their own unregulated impulses. If they had partaken too freely of the wine provided for the drink offerings, their sin would be similar to that of the Corinthians in their abuse of the Lord's Supper. As to the use of wine by the minister of God under the New Testament, see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>. The spiritual emotion, which, in the service of God, shows itself in pouring out the feelings in "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs," is contrasted, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18, 19</a>, with the physical excitement caused by wine, the former being commended and the latter forbidden. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye may teach the children of Israel</span>. This shows that one part of the priest's office was teaching the Law (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it <i>is</i> most holy:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-20.</span> - Moses takes care that the remaining part of the ritual of the day shall be carried out in spite of the terrible interruption that has occurred. Under his instructions, Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar eat the remainder of <span class="cmt_word">the meat offering</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), in the court of the tabernacle, and reserve <span class="cmt_word">the wave breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">heave shoulder</span> to <span class="cmt_word">eat in a clean place</span>, that is, not necessarily within the court; but he finds that the sin offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), which ought to be eaten by the priests, had been burnt. The rule was that, when the blood was presented in the tabernacle, the flesh was burned; when it was not, the flesh was eaten by the priests. In the present case, the blood had not been brought within the holy place, and yet the flesh had been burned instead of being eaten. Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, and demanded an explanation. Aaron's plea of defense was twofold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> His sons had fulfilled aright the ritual of their own sin offering and burnt offering, that is, the offerings made for the priests, and it had been rather his duty than theirs to see that the ritual of the sin offering of the congregation had been properly carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The state of distress in which he was, and the near escape that he had had from ceremonial defilement, and the sense of sin brought home to him by his children's death, had made him unfit and unable to eat the sin offering of the people, as he should have done under other circumstances. With this plea Moses was content. It was true that the letter of the Law had been broken, but there was a sufficient cause for it (see <a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It appears from hence that the expiation wrought by the sin offering was not complete until the whole ceremony was accomplished, the last act of which was the eating of the flesh by the priests in one class of sin offering, and the burning the flesh outside the camp in the other. It has been questioned, what is the full meaning of the expression, God hath given it you - the flesh of the sin offering - to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord. Archdeacon Freeman expresses the view of A Lapide, Keil, and many others when he says that, by eating the flesh of the offering, the priests "in a deep mystery neutralized, through the holiness vested in them by their consecration, the sin which the offerer had laid upon the victim and upon them" ('Principles of Divine Service,' part 2). Oehler, on the other hand (Herzog's 'Cyclop.,' 10), maintains that the priests did no more by this act than <span class="accented">declare</span> the removal of the sin already taken away; with which accords Philo's explanation ('De Vict.,' 13, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 6.) that the object of the sacrificial meal was to carry assurance of acceptance to the offerer, "since God would never have allowed his servants to partake of it had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin atoned for." Neither of these explanations seems to be altogether satisfactory. The former attributes more meaning to the expression <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> than it appears to have elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, where Aaron is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity of the holy things</span> and <span class="accented">of the sanctuary</span>; and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> of Israel and Judah. The latter interpretation appears too much to evacuate the meaning of the words. It is quite certain that the part of the ceremony by which the atonement was wrought (if it was wrought by any one part) was the offering of the blood for the covering of the offerer's sins, but yet this action of the priests in eating the flesh of the victim was in some way also connected with the atonement, not only with the assurance of its having been wrought; but in what way this was effected we are not told, and cannot pronounce. The words <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> are equivalent to making atonement for by taking the sin in some sense upon themselves (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, "He shall bear their iniquities," and <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away [or beareth] the sin of the world'). Accordingly, Bishop Patrick comments: "The very eating of the people's sin offering argued the sins of the people were, <span class="accented">in some sort</span>, laid upon the priests, to be taken away by them. From whence the sacrifice of Christ may be explained, who is said to <span class="accented">bear our iniquity</span> (as the priest is here said to do), all our sins being laid on him, who took upon him to make an expiation for them by the sacrifice of himself. For the priest, hereby eating of the sin offering, receiving the guilt upon himself, may well be thought to prefigure One who should be both Priest and Sacrifice for sin; which was accomplished in Christ" (on <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
