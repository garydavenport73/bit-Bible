Thus the promise to his seed, as well as to himself, rested on the principle of justification by faith only. The Law, of which the principle was essentially different, could not, and did not, in itself fulfil that promise; and that its fulfilment was not dependent on circumcision, or confined to the circumcised, is further shown by the fact that it was before his own circumcision that he received the blessing and the promise, Hence the seed intended in the promise was his spiritual seed, who are of faith such as his was; and in Christ, offering justification through faith to all, the promise is now fulfilled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall we say that Abraham our father according to the flesh hath found?</span> The connection, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the preceding argument is rather with vers. 27, 28 of ch. 3, than with its concluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This appears, not only from the drift of ch. 4, but also from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 2, connecting the thought with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="../../par/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The line of thought is, in the first place, this: We have said that all human glorying is shut out, and that no man can be justified except by faith: how, then (it is important to inquire), was it with Abraham our great progenitor? Did not he at least earn the blessing to his seed by the merit of his works? Had not he, on that ground, whereof to glory? No, not even he. Scripture, in what it says of him, distinctly asserts the contrary. There is uncertainty in this verse as to whether "according to the flesh" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) is to be connected with "our father" or with "hath found." Readings vary in their arrangement of the words. The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. But the great preponderance of authority is in favour of  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. The first of these readings requires the connection of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; the second allows it, but suggests the other connection. Theodoret, among the ancients, connecting with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, explains <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> thus: "What righteousness, of Abraham's, wrought <span class="accented">before he believed God</span>, did we ever hear of?" Calvin suggests, as the meaning of the phrase (though himself inclining to the connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," naturaliter vel ex seipso." Bull, similarly ('Harmonic Apostolica,' 'Disputatio Posterior,' c. 12:14-17), "by his natural powers, without the grace of God." Alford, following Meyer, says that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> is in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that it "refers to that department of our being from which spring works, in contrast with that in which is the exercise of faith." Difficulty is avoided if (as is the most natural inference from the best authenticated reading) we take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of our forefather in the way of natural descent, the question being put from the Jewish standpoint; and this in distinction from the other conception of descent from Abraham, according to which all the faithful are called his children (cl. <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 5, 8</a>:<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>). Among the ancients Chrysostom and Theophylact take this view.

"Not before God" must therefore have reference to the whole of the preceding sentence, in the sense, "It was not so in the sight of God." Before God (as appears from the text to be quoted) he had not whereof to glory on the ground of being justified by works, and therefore it follows that it was not by works that he was justified.

It has a peculiar cogency in the general argument from being in connection with, and with reference to, one of the Divine promises to Abraham of an unnumbered seed; so that it may be understood with an extended application to those who were to inherit the blessing, as well as to the "father of the faithful," and so declaring the principle of justification for all the "children of the promise." Further, it would be peculiarly telling as addressed to the Jews, who made such a point of their descent from Abraham as the root of all their position of privilege (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/105-6.htm">Psalm 105:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-2.htm">Isaiah 51:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt</span> (literally, <span class="accented">according to grace, but according to the debt, i.e.</span> according to what is due). <span class="cmt_word">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness</span>. The expression, "him that worketh" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), evidently means him that works with a view to a reward which he can claim; or, as Luther explains it, "one who deals in works;" or, as we might say with the same signification, "the worker." (For a like use of the present participle, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>.)

Thus there is here no denial of the necessity of good works. <span class="accented">It is the principle only of justification</span> that is in view. "Neque enim fideles vult esse ignavos; sed tantum mercenarias esse vetat, qui a Deo quicquam reposcant quasi jure debitum" (Calvin). One view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> is that it is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>, being meant as an illustration, thus: The workman's wage is due to him, and not granted as a favour (so Afford). But this notion does not suit the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> in the following verse. The strong word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;</span> ("ungodly") is not to be understood as designating Abraham himself, the proposition being a general one. Nor does it imply that continued <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is consistent with justification; only that even the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> are justified through faith on their repentance and amendment (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as David also describeth the blessedness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>.

The introduction of this testimony of David to the same principle of justification serves not only to explain it further, but also to show that under the Law too it continued to be recognized; and by David himself, the typical king and psalmist under the legal dispensation. But the argument from Abraham is not discontinued, being resumed in the next verse, and continued to the end of the chapter. If it be said that these verses from <a href="../../par/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32</a>. do not in themselves declare a general principle applicable to all, but only the blessedness to <span class="accented">sinners</span> of having their sins forgiven, it may be replied, firstly, that the way in which the verses are introduced does not require more to be implied. All that <span class="accented">need</span> be meant is that the ground of justification exemplified in Abraham's case is the same as is spoken of by David as still available for man, and crowned with blessing. But, secondly, it is to be observed that these verses represent and suggest the general tenor of the Book of Psalms, in which human righteousness is never asserted as constituting a claim to reward. "My trust is in thy mercy," is, on the contrary, the ever-recurring theme. St. Paul's quotations from the Old Testament are frequently given as suggestive of the general scriptural teaching on the subject in hand, rather than as exhaustive proofs in themselves.

Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision</span>. Faith, and not works, having been shown to be the principle of Abraham's justification, and those who were under the Mosaic Law, represented by David, having been seen to have shared the blessing of being so justified, the question still remains, whether it may not be confined to them only, or to Abraham's circumcised descendants only. That this cannot be is shown in two ways: firstly (vers. 10-13), from the fact that Abraham was himself <span class="accented">uncircumcised</span> when he was spoken of as being thus justified, so that neither the capability nor the inheritance of such justification can be viewed as dependent on circumcision; and, secondly (vers. 13-16), it is argued that the Law could not appropriate the privilege to his carnal descendants, the very principle of law being the opposite of that on which Abraham is said to have been justified. Thus the <span class="accented">seed</span>, innumerable as the stars, to be understood as inheritors of the promise made to him, and sharers in his blessing, are not his circumcised descendants, but a spiritual seed - they which are of faith being the true children of Abraham (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>).

The intention of ver. 12 is to express that, though the faithful who are not of Israel are Abraham's children, yet his circumcised descendants have not lost their privilege. They are already his children according to the flesh, and his spiritual children too, if they walk in the steps of his faith (cf. <a href="../../par/john/8-37.htm">John 8:37</a>, "I know that ye are Abraham's seed," compared with ver. 39, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham"). What now follows is to show (as above explained) that the Law could not be the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham, or appropriate its blessing to the Jews.

The point of the argument is that the principle of law is essentially different from that on which Abraham was justified, and which is hence to be understood in the fulfilment of the promise to him and his seed. How this is so is shortly intimated in ver. 15, the idea being more fully expounded in ch. 7. The idea is (as has been already explained) that law simply <span class="accented">declares</span> what is right, and <span class="accented">requires</span> conformity to it; it does not give either <span class="accented">power</span> to obey, or <span class="accented">atonement</span> for not obeying. Hence, in itself, it worketh, not righteousness, but <span class="accented">wrath</span>; for man becomes fully liable to wrath when he comes to know, through law, the difference between right and wrong (cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin"). Exactly the same view of the impossibility of the Mosaic Law being the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham is found in <a href="../../par/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, where also the real purpose of the Law, intervening thus between the promise and its fulfilment, is further explained. The expression in ver. 13, "that he should be the heir of the world," has reference to the ultimate scope of the Abrahamic promises (see <a href="../../par/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5, 6, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-9</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>). Now, it is true that in some of these promises the language used seems to denote no more than the temporal possession by Israel of the promised land, with dominion (actually realized under David and Solomon) over the whole country from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc. But their full scope transcends any such limited fulfilment, as where it is said that the promised seed should be as the stars of heaven, and as the dust of the earth that cannot be numbered, and that in it all the nations of the earth should be blessed. The prophets accordingly recognized a far larger ultimate fulfilment in their frequent pictures of the Messiah's universal dominion; and there was no need for the apostle to prove here what the Jews already understood. The only difference between the view current among them and his would be that they would mostly have in view a universal worldly sovereignty with its local centre on the throne of David at Jerusalem, while he interpreted spirttually, seeing beyond the outward framework of prophetic visions to the ideal they imply. "<span class="accented">Heres mundi</span> idem est quod <span class="accented">pater omnium gentium</span>, benedictionem accipientium.

It is to be observed that, though Abraham himself in ver. 13 is spoken of as "the heir of the world," yet the preceding expression, "to Abrabam or to his seed," sufficiently intimates that it is in his seed, identified with him, that he is conceived as so inheriting.

Its position in the Authorized Version might suggest its dependence on "believed," which is grammatically possible (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a>), but unallowable here, since hope cannot well be regarded as the <span class="accented">object</span> of belief) <span class="cmt_word">to the end he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>, viz.

With regard to the construction of ver. 20, we may observe that, though in the Authorized Version, which is followed above, the prepositions put before "unbelief" and "faith" are varied, both words are datives without a preposition in the Greek, and apparently with the same force of the dative in both cases, the sense being, "With regard to the promise, etc., <span class="accented">unbelief</span> did not cause him to waver (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">, but faith</span> made him strong <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)." The purport of the whole passage is to show, with reference to <a href="../../par/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9-16</a>, how Abraham's faith in the promise of a seed through Sarah, which seemed impossible in the natural course of things, corresponded in essence to our faith in "him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead" (ver. 24). It was faith in a Divine power above nature, able to quicken into supernatural life that which humanly is dead. And as Abraham's faith in this promised birth of Isaac involved a further faith in the fulfilment through him of all the promises, so our faith in the resurrection of Christ involves faith in all that is signified and assured to us thereby - in "the power of a Divine life" in him, to bring life out of death, to regenerate and quicken the spiritually dead, and finally in "eternal redemption" and the "restitution of all things" (cf. <a href="../../par/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18-23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; to which many other similarly significant passages might be added). It may be observed that, not only in the instance here adduced, but in his whole life as recorded in Genesis, Abraham stands forth as an exemplification of habitual faith in a Divine order beyond sight, and trust in Divine promises. In this consists the religious meaning of that record for us all. Notably so (as is especially set forth in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17</a>, etc.) in his willingness to sacrifice the son through whom the promise was to be fulfilled, retaining still his faith in the fulfilment.
