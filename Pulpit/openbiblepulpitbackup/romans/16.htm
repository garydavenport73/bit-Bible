She appears to have had business, perhaps of a legal kind, that took her to Rome; and St. Paul took advantage of her going to send the letter by her, desiring also to enlist the aid of her fellow-Christians at Rome in furtherance of her business, whatever it might be. Her having business at Rome, and her having been "a succourer of many," suggests the idea of her being a lady of means. Her designation as <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Church at Cenchrea probably implies that she held an office there corresponding to that of <span class="accented">deaconess</span>, though there is no reason to suppose the distinguishing term <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> to have been as yet in use. Her function, and that of others (as perhaps of Tryphena and Tryphosa, mentioned in ver. 12 as "labouring much in the Lord"), might be to minister to the sick and poor, and to fulfil such charitable offices as women could best discharge. Cf. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-11.htm">1 Timothy 3:11</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, mentioned in the midst of directions as to the qualifications of <span class="accented">men</span> for the office of deacons, probably denotes <span class="accented">women</span> who fulfilled similar duties. Cf. also Pliny's celebrated letter to Trajan (circ. A.D. 107), in which he says that he had extorted information as to the doings of Christians, "ex duabus ancillis, quae <span class="accented">ministrae</span> dicebantur." The Latin <span class="accented">ministra</span> answers exactly to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Cenchrea was the port of Corinth on the Saronic Gulf; and it appears from this passage that there was a Church or congregation there, as well as one or more in Corinth itself. It is an interesting conjecture that St. Paul, in speaking of Phoebe having been a succourer of himself as well as of others, may refer to an illness of his own at Cenchrea, during which she had ministered to him, and that his shaving his head at Cenchrea because he had a vow (<a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>) may have been during, or on his recovery from, that illness.

And greet the Church that is in their house.</span> For other notices of them, el. <a href="../../par/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2, 18, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>; whence we learn that Aquila was a Jew of Pontus, who, with his wife Priscilla, had been settled at Rome, whence, when the Jews were expelled by Claudius, they had gone to Corinth, where St. Paul found them on his first visit to that city; that St. Paul abode with them there, working with Aquila at tent-making, which was the croft of both; that they left Corinth with St. Paul for Syria, and were for a time left by him at Ephesus, where they instructed Apollos on his arrival there; that, when St. Paul wrote from Ephesus his First Epistle to the Corinthians, they sent greetings by it, having then a congregation of Christians which assembled at their house; that, having returned to Rome when the Epistle to the Romans was written, their house there also was made available for the same purpose; and that, when St. Paul was for the last time a prisoner at Rome before his martyrdom, they were once more living at Ephesus. They were probably in good circumstances, having had both at Rome and Ephesus houses large enough to be used as churches; and they were evidently leading and active members of the Christian community. It would seem that Priscilla, the wife, was especially so, and she may have been, like Phoebe, officially employed; for though, when they are first mentioned (<a href="../../par/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>) as having lately come to Corinth, and when they themselves send greetings to Corinth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>), Aquila's name naturally comes first, yet St. Paul in all other mention of them reverses the order. The occasion of their having apparently risked their own lives in defence of St. Paul is unknown. It may have been at Corinth at the time of the Jewish insurrection against him (<a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>), or at Ephesus at the time of the tumult raised by Demetrius the silversmith (<a href="../../par/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23</a>, etc.), when St. Paul had been in imminent danger. The phrase, "laid down their neck" (not, as in the Authorized Version, "necks"), seems only to denote, figuratively, . "exposed their lives to danger." It appears, from the large number of greetings which follow, that there were now many Christians at Rome known to, or any rate known of by, the apostle. It does not follow that he was acquainted with all of them personally. He may have heard of them in the frequent inquiries he had doubtless made about the Roman Church (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). Many of them, however, he evidently knew, and with some had been associated. It was likely that many known to him in various quarters might have had occasion to resort to Rome. There are in all twenty-six individuals to whom greetings are sent, together with two households of slaves, and probably three congregations, as will appear below. <span class="cmt_word">Salute</span> (or, as before, <span class="accented">greet</span>. The verb is the same as before, and so throughout the chapter) <span class="cmt_word">my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Asia</span> (certainly so, rather than <span class="accented">Achaia</span>, probably introduced into the text from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>) <span class="cmt_word">unto Christ</span>. <span class="accented">Asia</span> means the proconsular province so called, being the western part of Asia Minor, of which the capital was Ephesus. Epaenetus may have been St. Paul's own first convert there during his second missionary journey (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>). The fact of the apostle having been then "forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia" does not preclude there having been converts thence.

There are in all five persons so designated in this chapter. The designation "fellow-prisoners" implies that these two had been, like himself, at some time imprisoned for the faith, but it does not fellow that he and they had been in prison together. If, in speaking of them as "of note among the apostles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)," he means to designate them as themselves apostles, this is an instance of a wider use of the term "apostle" than is generally understood (see note under Romans 12:6, etc.). The phrase, however, will bear the interpretation that they were persons held in honour in the circle of the original twelve. The term, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is certainly often used distinctively of them, as in <a href="../../par/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a> and in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, by St. Paul himself, the reference in both texts being to his own relations to them; and so here, speaking of two persons, who he also says had been in Christ before himself, he may only mean to point to their having been, as they still were, distinguished in association with the original apostles even before his own conversion.

This Narcissus may possibly have been the powerful freedman of Claudius, mentioned by Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 11:29, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; 12:57; and by Suetonius, 'Claud.,' 28. The fact that he appears from 'Ann.,' 13:1, to have been put to death on the accession of Nero, A.D. 54, is not inconsistent with the supposition. For his human chattels would be likely to pass into the possession of Nero, and so become part of Caeasar's household, and might still be called by their late master's name. This may also have been the case with the household of Aristobulus above referred to. It is observable that, at a later period, the apostle, writing from Rome to the Philippians, sends special greetings from them "that are of Caesar's household" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-23.htm">Philippians 4:23</a>).

All these seem to have been Church workers; and the last at least, from the way St. Paul speaks of her, must have been known by him personally, and done work of which he was cognizant. It is to be observed how, in calling her "the beloved," he avoids, with delicate propriety, adding "my," as he does in speaking of his male friends.

Similar delicate courtesy of language is especially observable in the Epistle to Philemon.

Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 85) speaks of it as exchanged before the Eucharist, and it is alluded to by many Fathers, directed in the 'Apostolical Constitutions,' and has its place in ancient liturgies (see Bingham, 15. 3:3). St. Paul, of course, in enjoining it here and in other Epistles, has in view the concord which it expressed. In sending salutations from "all the Churches of Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, omitted in the Textus Receptus, having authority decidedly in its favour), he may be understood as conveying to the Roman Christians the feeling towards them that had been expressed generally by the Churches he had visited. He may have spoken wherever he went of his intention of visiting Rome, and perhaps of meanwhile sending a letter thither; and the several Churches may have charged him with kind messages. Before authenticating these salutations with his usual autographic benediction, he feels bound to add one additional warning. The thought occurs to him, and he cannot but give expression to it. The warning is against a class of persons whose mischievous activity he had had experience of elsewhere, and attempts by some of whom to disturb the peace of the Roman Church he may possibly have heard cf. They may have been Judaists, or others who taught views contrary to the received faith, and so caused divisions and offences in the Churches. For allusions to such elsewhere, cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; Galatians 3:1, <span class="accented">seq</span>.; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>, <span class="accented">seq</span>.

Had St. Paul thought these people sincere though mistaken, he would doubtless have treated them with the tenderness he shows towards the weak brethren. But he regards them as self-interested, and of the flesh; and against such disturbers of the Church's peace he is, here as elsewhere, indignant (el. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11, 12</a>). In speaking of them as serving, or being slaves to, their own belly, it cannot be concluded certainly that he attributed to them habits of sensuality. He may only mean that it is the gratification of the lower part of their nature that they have in view; and there may be allusion to the motive of such persons being the desire of eating and drinking at the cost of the Churches. In 'The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' (alluded to under Romans 12:6, <span class="accented">seq</span>.) the desire to live without working at the cost of the Church is set down as one of the marks of a false apostle or a false prophet. <span class="cmt_word">And by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple</span> (rather, <span class="accented">innocent</span>, or <span class="accented">harmless.</span> So the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is translated in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>.
