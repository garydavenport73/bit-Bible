He has already (<a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>) admonished his readers to be "of the same mind one toward another;" but, as was remarked under that verse, this did not imply agreement of view on all subjects, such as is impossible where there are many minds. In this chapter he recognizes the impossibility, having immediately before him what was then patent, the inability of some, through prejudice or slowness of conception, to enter into views of the meaning of the gospel which to himself and the more enlightened were apparent. He by no means departs from what he says elsewhere (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-10</a>) about no denial of fundamental doctrine being allowable in the communion of the Church; but in matters not touching the foundation he does here inculcate a large and generous tolerance. In these, as in all other relations between men on the earth together, the all-inspiring principle of <span class="accented">charity</span> is to rule. Who the "weak brethren" were whose scruples he especially inculcates tolerance of in this chapter cannot be decided positively. It will he seen that they were persons who thought it their duty to abstain from animal food, and perhaps also from wine (vers. 2, 21); and there is allusion also to observance of certain days (ver. 5). The views that have been taken are as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That they were the same class of Jewish Christians as are spoken of in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. as over-scrupulous about eating of things that had been offered in sacrifice to idols. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That they were such as were scrupulous in avoiding unclean meats, forbidden in the Mosaic Law. (Or, as Erasmus and others suggest, views (1) and (2) may be combined.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That they were <span class="accented">ascetics.</span> In favour of view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is the fact that the drift and tone of the exhortation is exactly the same here as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>, with similarity also of expressions, such as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Against it are the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that in the chapter before us there is no allusion whatever to idol-meats, as there is throughout so markedly in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that abstinence from all animal food whatever (and apparently from wine too) is spoken of in this chapter. Objection (<span class="accented">a</span>) has been met by saying that the ground of the scrupulosity referred to might be so well known that St. Paul did not think it necessary to mention it when he wrote to the Romans. To objection (<span class="accented">b</span>) it is replied that there might be some who, in order to guard against the risk of buying at the shambles, or partaking in general society of viands connected with heathen sacrifices, made a point of abstaining from meat altogether, and (it has been suggested) from wine too, which might have been used in libations. This is the view of Clement of Alexandria, Ambrosiastor, and Augustine, among the ancients. View (2) is that of Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Jerome, and others, among whom Chrysostom accounts for the <span class="accented">total</span> abstinence from meat as follows: "There were many of the Jews that believed, who, being still bound in conscience to the Law, even after believing still observed the ordinances about meats, not as yet venturing to depart from the Law; and then, in order not to be conspicuous in abstaining from swine's flesh only, they abstained from all flesh, and ate herbs only, that their practice might seem to be rather fasting, and not observance of the Law" (so also OEcumenius and Theophylact). But this seems to be a conjecture only, and hardly a likely one. And further, it fails to account for abstinence from wine, which seems to be implied; on the part of tome at least, in ver. 21. (It may be observed, however, that this is not of necessity implied. Abstinence from meat is all that has been spoken of before, and again in ver. 23; and St. Paul may possibly mean only to say, in ver. 21, that if by abstaining from wine also he could avoid offence to a weak brother, he would willingly so abstain. Still, the natural inference is that he would not have mentioned wine had there not been some who made it a point of conscience to abstain from it.) If the weak brethren were ascetics, according to view (3), it is most probable that they were Jewish Christians who had imbibed the principles of the <span class="accented">Essenes</span>. These were a Jewish sect, spoken of especially by josephus, who aimed at scrupulous observance of the Law of Moses, and strict personal purity. With this view they lived in communities under rule, partaking of the simplest fare, and some abstaining from marriage. It does not appear that they were strict vegetarians when living in community; but we are told that they might only eat such meat as had been prepared by their own members, so as to be secure against any pollution, and that, if excommunicated, they were consequently compelled to eat herbs. (For what is known of them, see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2; 8:2-5; 'Ant.,' 13:05. 9; 15:10. 4, 5; 18:1. 2, etc.; Philo, 'Quod Omnis Probus Liber,' see. 12, etc.; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 5:16, 17.) It is far from unlikely that some of these would be attracted to Christianity; and this especially as some of their principles, as described by Josephus, seem to have been endorsed by Christ himself (see art. on "Essenes," in 'Dict. of Christian Biog.,' vol. 2. p. 202); and, if so, they would be likely to carry their prejudices with them into the Church, and, when living outside their original communities, they might abstain entirely from flesh as well as wine. Or it might be that other Jews, Essenic in principle and feeling, had sought admission into the Church. Philo, in Eusebius, 'Praep. Evan.,' 8. fin., and Josephus, 'Vit.,' 2. 3, intimate that supra-legal asceticism, under the influence of Essenic principles, was not uncommon in Judaism in their time. The latter (c. 3) speaks of certain priests, his friends, who were so God-fearing that they subsisted on figs and nuts, and (c. 2) of one Banns, who had been his master, who ate no food but vegetables. What is still more to our purpose is that we find evidence of pious ascetics of the same type subsequently among Christians. Origen ('Contra Cels.,' 5:49) speaks of some as living in his time; and even the apostle St. Matthew, and James the Lord's brother, were afterwards credited with a corresponding mode of life. Clement of Alexandria ('Paedag.' 2:1) says of the former, "Matthew the apostle partook of seeds and acorns and herbs, without flesh." Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius (2:23), says of the latter that "he drank not wine or strong drinks, nor did he eat animal food; a razor came not upon his head; he did not anoint himself with oil; he did not use the bath." It is to be observed that abstinence from ointments was one of the practices of the Essenes (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 8:2. 3). Augustine ('Ad Faust.,' 22:3) transmits the same tradition as to the abstinence of James from flesh and wine. Whatever foundation them might be for these traditions, they at any rate show that in the second century, when Hegesippus wrote, abstinence such as is intimated in this chapter was regarded as a mark of superior sanctity by some Christians. Farther, in the 'Apostolical Canons' (Canon 51.), Christians who abstained from marriage, or flesh, or wine, are allowed to be retained in the communion of the Church as long as they did so by way of religious restraint only. Against the above view of the weak brethren of the chapter before us having been ascetics of the Essenic type, is alleged the strong condemnation of persons supposed to have been of the same sort in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 16</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>, and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1-5</a>, which is said to be inconsistent with the tender tolerance recommended here. But the teachers referred to in the later Epistles, though inculcating practices similar to those of the "weak brethren," appear to have been heretical theosophists, the germ probably of later Gnosticism. Their tenets may indeed, in part at least, have been developed from Esseuism; but it was no longer mere conscientious scrupulosity, but principles subversive of the faith, that St. Paul set his face against in writing to the Colossians and to Timothy. Canon 51. in the 'Apostolical Canons' above referred to may be adduced as distinguishing between the principles on which asceticism might be practised allowably or otherwise; it being therein laid down that any who abstained from marriage, flesh, or' wine, not by way of religious restraint, but as abhorring them, forgetting that God made all things very good, and that he made man male and female, and blaspheming the work of creation, should be cast out of the Church. It remains to be observed that there was diffused among the Gentiles also, through the influence of the Neo-Pythagorean philosophy, an asceticism similar to the Essenic (see Senec., 'Ep.,' 108, and Porphyr., 'De Abstin.'), which Eichhoru supposes the "weak brethren" of this chapter to have been affected by, regarding them as mostly Gentile Christians. But Jewish influences are much more probable; the scruples referred to in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. were certainly due to them; and observe ver. 5 in this chapter, which cannot but refer to Jewish observances. Further, Origen, in the treatise above referred to, expressly distinguishes between Christian and Pythagorean asceticism. His words are, "But see also the difference of the cause of the abstinence from creatures having life as practised by the Pythagoreans and by the ascetics among ourselves. For they abstain because of the fable concerning the transmigration of souls;...  but we, though we may practise the like, do it when we keep under the flesh and bring it into subjection" ('Contra Cels.,' 4). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that is weak in the faith</span> (rather, <span class="accented">in faith</span>, or <span class="accented">in his faith</span>).

But the weak require an admonition too. Their temptation was <span class="accented">to judge</span> those who indulged in freedom which to themselves appeared unlawful; and here, in ver. 5, the apostle gives such as did so a sharp reproof.

"God hath received him" refers evidently, as appears from its position and from the following verse, to <span class="accented">him that eateth.</span> God hath received him to himself in Christ, whosoever may sit in judgment on him.

"For God is able," etc., seems to require this meaning. The non-abstainer's freedom does not endanger his position; for God is powerful to sustain him, and to God alone he is accountable.

But a comparison with <a href="../../par/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10</a> and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> suggests rather a general reference to days of observance under the Jewish Law. The same class of weak brethren with Jewish prejudices that was scrupulous about meats would be likely to be also scrupulous about days and seasons and if scruples on the latter head seem to be mentioned only incidentally in this chapter, it may be because the others were at that time mainly conspicuous, and threatening to disturb the peace of the Church. One view that has been taken is that this short allusion to observance of days is introduced only in the way of illustration and argument; it being supposed that difference of practice with regard to days <span class="accented">was</span> allowed without dispute, and that what St. Paul means to say is, "You do exercise mutual tolerance in this matter extend the same principle to the matter of meats, to which it is equally applicable. This view of the meaning of the passage would derive support from the reading of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> at the beginning of ver. 5, which rests on fair authority. The supposed reference to Jewish days of obligation in general is.. not inconsistent with the apparent condemnation of the observance of such days by Christians in <a href="../../par/galatians/4.htm">Galatians 4</a>. and Colossians it. For see what has been said above about the drift of <a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> and of <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>, etc. When the observances came to be insisted on as obligatory on principle, it was a different thing from mere conscientious scrupulosity. <span class="cmt_word">Let every man be fully persuaded</span> (for the verb in this sense, cf. <a href="../../par/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>) <span class="cmt_word">in his own mind</span>. To St. Paul himself the observance or non-observance of the days referred to was a matter in itself of no importance. He was content that each person should act up to his own conscientious convictions on the subject.

Both parties are supposed to be equally desirous of serving God. The eater of whatsoever is set before him is so, as is shown by his thanking God for it - observe "for he giveth," etc. - and no creature of God can be polluting "if received with thanksgiving" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-5.htm">1 Timothy 4:5</a>); the abstainer gives thanks too; and so his dinner of herbs is also hallowed to him. (Though it is not necessary to confine the thought to the practice of saying grace before meat, this is doubtless in view as expressing the asserted thankfulness. For proof of the custom, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-36.htm">Matthew 15:36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-35.htm">Acts 27:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-30.htm">1 Corinthians 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4, 5</a>.)

"Nam mortem pro salute nostra obeundo dominium sibi acquisivit quod nec morte solveretur; resurgendo autem totam vitam nostram in peculium accepit; morte igitur et resurrectione sua promeritus est ut tam in morte quam in vita gloriae nominis ejus serviamus" (Calvin). For the idea of this whole passage (vers. 7-9), cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-15.htm">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>. The apostle now returns to his immediate subject, warning (as in ver. 3) the one party against <span class="accented">judging</span> and the other against <span class="accented">despising</span>, on the ground of all alike having to abide hereafter the Divine judgment (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3, 5</a>). The distinction in ver. 10 between the two parties, marked in the original by the initial <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> and the following <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;</span>, is somewhat lost in our Authorized Version.

In all that follows St. Paul returns exclusively to the more enlightened ones, whose feelings were in accordance with his own; and he now presses a further thought upon them, namely of the harm they might be doing to the very souls of the weak ones by tempting them, either by word or example, to disobey their own consciences. <span class="cmt_word">But judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block in his brother's way, or an occasion of falling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).
