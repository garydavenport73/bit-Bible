<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-2.htm">2 Corinthians 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In this we groan.</span> Since we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, who assures us of that future building from God, we, in this earthly tent, "groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit the redemption of our body" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To be clothed upon;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to further clothe ourselves with</span>. Here the metaphors of a tent and a garment - the "wandering tent" and the "mortal vesture of decay" - are interfused in a manner on which only the greatest writers can venture The corruptible yearns to clothe itself with the incorruptible, the mortal with immortality (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>). The glorified body is compared to an over garment, <span class="cmt_word">House</span>; rather, <span class="accented">habitation</span> (<span class="accented">oiketerion</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If so be that.</span> The verse may be rendered, "If, that is, being clothed, we shall not be found naked." The word "naked" must then mean "bodiless," and the reference will be to those whom, at his coming, Christ shall find <span class="accented">clothed in these mortal bodies</span>, and not separated from them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quick and not dead (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). This seems to be the simplest and most natural of the multitude of strange interpretations with which the pages of commentators are filled. It is true that the aorist <span class="accented">endusamenoi</span>, means literally, "having clothed ourselves," and that, in taking this meaning, we should have expected the perfect participle <span class="accented">endedumenoi</span>, having been clothed. If this be thought an insuperable difficulty, we must suppose the verse to mean "If, that is, in reality we shall be found [at Christ's coming] after having put on some intermediate body, and therefore not as mere disembodied spirits." But there is no allusion in Scripture to any intermediate body, nor is any gleam of light shed on the mode of life among the dead between death and resurrection, though the Church rejects the dream of Psychopannychia, or an interval of unconscious sleep. The uncertainty of the meaning is increased by two various readings, <span class="accented">ei per</span> instead of <span class="accented">ei ge</span>, which latter expresses greater doubt about the matter; and <span class="accented">ekdusamenoi</span> (D, F, G), which would mean "if in reality, after <span class="accented">unclothing</span> ourselves [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> after 'shuffling off this mortal coil'], we shall not be found naked." This seems to be the conjecture of some puzzled copyists, who did not see that a <span class="accented">contrast</span>, and not a coincidence, between the two expressions is intended. If this reading were correct, it would mean, as Chrysostom says, "Even if we would lay aside the body. we shall not there be presented <span class="accented">without a</span> body, but with the <span class="accented">same</span> body which has then become incorruptible." It is quite untenable to make "clothed" mean "clothed <span class="accented">with righteousness</span>," as Olshausen does. In the Talmud, 'Shabbath' (f. 152, 2), the righteous are compared to men who keep from stain the robes given them by a king (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their bodies), which robes the king deposits in his treasury and sends the wearers away (bodiless) in peace; but foolish servants stain these robes, and the king sends the robes to the wash, and the wearers in prison. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">For we that are in <i>this</i> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we that are,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">for indeed we who are in the tent</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the  transitory mortal body. <span class="cmt_word">Do groan.</span> "Oh wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

St. Paul here repudiates the Manichean notion that the body is a disgrace, or in itself the source of evil. He was not like Plotinus, who "blushed that he had a body;" or like St. Francis of Assist, who called his body "my brother the ass;" or like the Cure d'Ars, who (as we have said) spoke of his body as "ce cadavre." He does not, therefore, desire to get rid of his body, but to "clothe it over" with the garment of immortality. Incidentally this implies the wish that he may be <span class="accented">alive</span> and not <span class="accented">dead</span> when the Lord returns (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35-54</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mortality</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the mortal</span>; <span class="accented">that which is mortal</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Might be swallowed up of life.</span> As in the case of Enoch (<a href="../../par/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and Elijah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), who entered into life otherwise than through "the grave and gate of death." St. Paul wishes to enter the "building from God" without having been first buried in the collapse of the "soul's dark cottage battered and decayed." He desires to put on the robe of immortality without stripping off the rent garb of the body.

St. Paul might naturally use this Roman and Greek idea of the <span class="accented">bema</span>, being too familiar with it in his own experience (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/25-6.htm">Acts 25:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The things done in the body;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the things</span> (<span class="accented">done</span>) <span class="accented">by the instrumentality of the body</span>.

St. Paul, always intent on one subject at a time, does not stop to coordinate this law of natural retribution and inexorable Nemesis with that of the "forgiveness of sins" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), or with the apparently universal hopes which he seems sometimes to express (<a href="../../par/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). <span class="accented">Omnia exeunt in mysterium</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>According to that he hath done;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with reference to the things he did</span>. The aorist shows that all life will be as it were concentrated to one point. The Pelagians raised questions on this verse about the sinlessness of infants, etc., all of which  may be left on one side, as probably nothing was more absolutely distant from the thoughts of St. Paul. Observe that each is to receive the natural issues of what he has done. There is to be an analogy between the sin and the retribution. The latter is but the ripe fruit of the former. We shall be punished by the action of natural laws, not of arbitrary inflictions. We shall reap what we have sown, not harvests of other grain (<a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be good or bad.</span> St. Paul, who always confines himself to one topic at a time, does not here enter on the question of the cutting off of the entailed curse by repentance and forgiveness. He leaves unsolved the antinomy between normal inevitable consequence and free remission.

It is the text usually chosen by those who wish to excuse a setting forth of God under the attributes of Moloch. With any such views it has not the remotest connection. It simply means, "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men," either "to keep in view the same fear of the Lord as ourselves," or (reverting to his last assertion of his own sincerity and integrity in ver. 9), "that our sole ambition is to please God." The rendering, "the terror of the Lord," for the every day expression, "the fear of the Lord," was wantonly intruded into modern versions by Beza, and has not a single word to be said in its favour. The phrase means (as always) not the dread which God inspires, but the holy fear which mingles with our love of him. To teach men to regard God with terror is to undo the best teaching of all Scripture, which indeed has too often been the main end of human systems of theology. <span class="accented">We persuade men</span>. Not in a bad sense (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).

The Corinthians were being robbed of this by the interested lies of St. Paul's opponents, who thought only about outward appearances. This is why no has set forth to them the aim and glory of his ministry. Nothing could be more gentle and forbearing than such a mode of stating his object. Yet for those who were sufficiently finely strung to understand it, there was an almost pathetic irony involved in it. <span class="cmt_word">Which glory in appearance, and not in heart;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in face</span>.

It is the exact antithesis to madness (<a href="../../par/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>). What you call my "madness" belongs to the relation between my own soul and God; my practical sense and tact are for you. <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for you</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The love of Christ.</span> It matters little whether this be interpreted as a subjective genitive, "Christ's love to man," or as an objective genitive, our love to Christ;" for the two suppose and interfuse each other. St. Paul's usage, however, favours the former interpretation (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-24.htm">1 Corinthians 16:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Constraineth</span>. The word means that it compresses us,  and therefore keeps us irresistibly to one object (<a href="../../par/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That if one died for all, then were all dead.</span> This is an unfortunate mistranslation and wrong reading for <span class="accented">that one died for all, therefore all died</span>. What compels Paul to sacrifice himself to the work of God for his converts is the conviction, which he formed once for all at his conversion, that One, even Christ, died on behalf of all men (<a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-19</a>) a redeeming death (ver. 21); and that, consequently, in that death, all <span class="accented">potentially</span> died with him - died to their life of sin, and rose to the life of righteousness. The best comments on this bold and concentrated phrase are - "I died to the Law that I might live to Christ;" "I have been <span class="accented">crucified with Christ"</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); and, "Ye died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>). When Christ died, all humanity, of which he was the federal Head, died potentially with him to sin and selfishness, as he further shows in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-15.htm">2 Corinthians 5:15</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>that</i> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto themselves.</span> That they should live no longer the psychic, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the animal, selfish, egotistic life, but to their risen Saviour (<a href="../../par/romans/14-7.htm">Romans 14:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).

The whole phrase, which has been interpreted in multitudes of different ways, and has led to many different hypotheses, must be understood in accordance with the context. St. Paul is saying that he has now renounced all mere earthly and human judgments; and he here implies that the day has been (whether - which is a very unlikely view - before his conversion, when he looked on Christ as a "deceiver," or just after his conversion, when possibly he may only have known him partially as the <span class="accented">Jewish</span> Messiah) when he knew Christ only in this fleshly way; but henceforth he will know him so no more. Probably this "knowing Christ after the flesh" is a rebuke to those members of the Christ party at Corinth who may have boasted that they were superior to all others because they had personally seen or known Christ - a spirit which Christ himself not only discouraged (<a href="../../par/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>) but even rebuked (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>). To St. Paul Christ is now regarded as far above all local, national, personal, and Jewish limitations, and as the principle of spiritual life in the heart of every Christian. In the view which he took of his Lord St. Paul henceforth has banished all Jewish particularism for gospel catholicity. He regards Christ, not in the light of earthly relationships and conditions, but as the risen, glorified, eternal, universal Saviour.

If even a human, personal, external knowledge of Christ is henceforth of no significance, it follows that there must have been a total change in all relations towards him. The historic fact of such a changed relationship is indicated clearly in <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>. Mary Magdalene was there lovingly taught that a "recognition of Christ after the flesh," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as merely a <span class="accented">human</span> friend, was to be a thing of the past. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Christian.

The phrase is borrowed from the rabbis who used it to express the condition of a proselyte. But the meaning is not mere Jewish arrogance and exclusiveness, but the deep truth of spiritual regeneration and the new birth (<a href="../../par/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Old things;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the ancient things</span>, all that belongs to the old Adam. <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>.

That God's purpose of mercy embraced all mankind, and not an elect few, is again and again stated in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not imputing their trespasses unto them.</span> See this developed in <a href="../../par/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5-8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Hath entrusted unto us;</span> literally, <span class="accented">who also deposited in us</span>, as though it were some sacred treasure.

This excludes all secondary aims. St. Paul uses the  same expression in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>, adding with fine contrast that he is "an ambassador in fetters." <span class="cmt_word">As though God did beseech you by us;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as if God were exhorting you by our means</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ's stead;</span> rather, <span class="accented">we, on Christ's behalf, beseech you</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Be ye reconciled to God.</span> This is the sense of the embassy.

The expression is closely analogous to that in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, where it is said that Christ has been "made <span class="accented">a curse</span> for us." He was, as St. Augustine says, "delictorum susceptor, non commissor." He knew no sin; nay, he was the very righteousness, holiness itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), and yet, for our benefit, God made him to be "sin" for us, in that he "sent him in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>). Many have understood the word "sin" in the sense of sin offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-9.htm">Leviticus 5:9</a>, LXX.); but that is a precarious application of the word, which is not justified by any other passage in the New Testament. We cannot, as Dean Plumptre says, get beyond the simple statement, which St. Paul is content to leave in its unexplicable mystery, "Christ identified with man's sin; man identified with Christ's righteousness." And thus, in Christ, God becomes Jehovah-Tsidkenu, "the Lord our Righteousness" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might be made the righteousness of God in him;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that we might become</span>. The best comment on the pregnant significance of this verse is <a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16, 17</a>, which is developed and explained in so large a section of that great Epistle (see 3:22-25; 4:5-8; 5:19, etc.). <span class="accented">In him</span> In his blood is a means of propitiation by which the righteousness of God becomes the righteousness of man (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>), so that man is justified.
