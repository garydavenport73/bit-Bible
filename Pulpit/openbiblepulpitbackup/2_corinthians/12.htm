In mere vowel variations, especially in passages where the meaning does not lie on the surface, the diplomatic (external) evidence is less important. If St. Paul wrote <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f74;</span>, it means, "of course it is not expedient for me to boast." <span class="cmt_word">I will come;</span> <span class="accented">for I will come</span>; if the reading of D is correct. In that case it is hardly possible to define the counter currents of feeling which caused the use of the conjunction. <span class="cmt_word">Visions and revelations.</span> The word used for "visions" means presentations perceived in a state which is neither sleeping nor waking, but which are regarded as objective; "revelations" are the truths apprehended as a result of the visions. <span class="accented">Optasia</span>, for "visions," only occurs elsewhere in <a href="../../par/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-23.htm">Luke 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>).

To St. Paul every true Christian was a man whose personal life was lost in the life of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Above fourteen years ago.</span> The note of time is very vague. If we are <span class="accented">at all</span> able to identify the vision alluded to, it must have been the vision in the temple, referred to in <a href="../../par/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>, which was, roughly speaking, "about fourteen years" before this time. The vision on the road to Damascus had occurred about twenty years earlier than the date of this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Whether in the body,</span> etc. A powerful description of the absorption of all conscious <span class="accented">bodily</span> modes of apprehension. In their comments on. these verses, many commentators enter into speculations which seem to me to be so entirely arbitrary and futile that I shall not even allude to them. St. Paul's bodily and mental state during this vision is familiar to all who know the history of Oriental and mediaeval mysticism. <span class="cmt_word">Caught up</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the third heaven.</span> It is most unlikely that St. Paul is here in any way referring to the Jewish <span class="accented">hagadoth</span> about seven heavens. The expression is purely general, and even the rabbis did not expect to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre</span>. Hence all speculations about first, second, and third heavens are idle and useless. Even as late as the Clementine writings in the middle of the second century, an attempt is made, in reference to this passage, to disparage St. Paul by sneering at visions as a medium of revelation, on the ground that they may spring from self-deception; and this rapture of the "bald hook-nosed Galilean" to the third heaven is also sneered at in the 'Philopatris' of the pseudo-Lucian. Yet how modest and simple is St. Paul's awestruck reference to this event, when compared, not only with the lying details of Mohammed's visit to heaven, but even with the visions of St. Theresa or Swedenborg!

Such questions are clearly insoluble, and I leave them where I find them. We shall never understand this passage otherwise than in the dim and vague outline in which St. Paul has purposely left it. All that we can know from the New Testament about Paradise must be learnt from this verse and <a href="../../par/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>, and it is extremely little. <span class="cmt_word">Unspeakable words.</span> A figure of speech called an oxymoron.

The more usual meaning is, as Hesychius says, "a sharp stake" ('Sudes,' Tert.). Hence the word <span class="accented">skolopizo</span>, I impale or crucify. St. Paul's agony was an impalement or crucifixion of all sensual impulses and earthly ambitions. <span class="cmt_word">In the flesh.</span> There have been endless conjectures as to the exact nature of this painful and most humbling physical affliction. It is only by placing side by side a great many separate passages that we are almost irresistibly led to the conclusion which is now most generally adopted, namely, that it was acute and disfiguring ophthalmia, originating in the blinding glare of the light which flashed round him at Damascus, and accompanied, as that most humiliating disease usually is, by occasional cerebral excitement. It would be impossible here to enter into the whole inquiry, for which! refer to my 'Life of St. Paul,' 1:214-226. <span class="cmt_word">The messenger of Satan;</span> rather, <span class="accented">an angel of Satan</span>.
