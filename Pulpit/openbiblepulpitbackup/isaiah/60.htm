In the radiance of this light she was to stand up and show herself, and then great results would follow.

Ephah is a sub-tribe of Midian (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-4.htm">Genesis 25:4</a>). These nomads would visit the distant Sheba, in Happy Arabia, for purposes of trade, and would procure there gold and incense, which they would convey to Palestine. The "Sheba" intended is doubtless that whose queen visited Solomon, and brought with her gold in abundance, and "of spices very great store, and precious stones" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>). The Egyptians appear to have called the kingdom of the Shebaim (Sabaeans) "Punt," and to have traded with it from a very early time, especially for frankincense (' Records of the Past,' vol. 10. pp. 14-19; Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 132-134, 221-224). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">dromedaries</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the young camels</span>, or <span class="accented">the camel colts. <span class="cmt_word"></span>All they</span> <span class="cmt_word">from Sheba shall come;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (i.e. the camels of Midian and Ephah) <span class="accented">shall come all together from Sheba.</span>

During the Maccabee period we find the Nabataeans in alliance with the Jews, and giving them some valuable assistance (1 Macc. 5:25 1 Macc. 9:35). The locality of the Nabataeans was northern Arabia, or the tract lying between the Elanitic Gulf and the Lower Euphrates. The wealth of the Nabataeans and the Kedarenes was in their flocks and herds; and this wealth, it is prophesied, they will place, at the disposal of Israel<span class="cmt_word">.

The renovated Zion contains a glorious temple, and the temple has in it an altar, to which the sheep and rams are brought - not, however, to be offered in sacrifice, but to be presented to God and become a part of the wealth of the Church.

The passage has, however, a meaning beyond the literal one. "Strangers" of all kinds, Greeks, and Romans, and Syrians, and Africans, and Cauls, and Spaniards, and others, assisted in building and enlarging the walls of the Church as it spread over the world, set up its bulwarks in the Creeds, and fenced it round about with various decrees and canons. <span class="cmt_word">Their kings shall minister unto thee</span> (see the comment on ver. 3).

Considered as imagery, the representation is that the barren hills which stand about Jerusalem shall, in the new state of things, be decked with tall and beautiful forest trees, all the sylvan scenery of Lebanon being transported to Southern Palestine, so as to encompass the city of God with a garden as delightful as that of Eden. The spiritual meaning is that graces of all kinds shall abound in and around the holy city, and shall make it beautiful and glorious. <span class="cmt_word">The fir tree, the pine</span> <span class="cmt_word">tree, and the box together</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>, where the same words occur in the same order; and, for the trees intended, see the comment on that passage). <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">beautify the place of my sanctuary</span>. Not with "avenues of cedars and plane trees leading up to it" (Delitzsch), which was a style of ornamentation quite unknown to the lie-brews; but with groves, and thickets, and sylvan glades, and wooded slopes all around it, as round the Syrian temples in the Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The place of my feet</span>.

Zion has been a wife repudiated for her adulteries, "forsaken" by her husband, and the object of his just "hate." So that no man went through thee. The mixed metaphor is awkward, but readily intelligible. Zion is at once a city and a wife. As a wife, she is "hated and forsaken," as a city, no man goes through her. An eternal excellency (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>, and see the Homiletics on the passage).

The general idea is that the glorious age of Solomon would return (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21, 27</a>), and Zion be as resplendent and as wealthy as in his time. The material splendour is, no doubt, throughout the whole description, typical in the main of spiritual glories and excellences. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. "Peace" and "righteousness" are here personified; and the declaration is that they shall bear rule in the community whereof the prophet is speaking (comp, <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-16.htm">Isaiah 32:16, 17</a>).

The entire cessation of war and violence is one of the most characteristic features of the "last times," when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, and spears into pruning-hooks. "The Prince of Peace" shall ultimately establish peace. It is not surprising that men of earnest religious feeling should have thought, at various times, that they saw the actual commencement of the reign of peace upon earth, so distinctly promised, so earnestly longed for, so necessary for the happiness of mankind. But to a calm and dispassionate observer the nineteenth century seems scarcely more advanced upon the road which leads to this desirable end than the first. Thou shall call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The true wall of the city will be the "salvation" of which God assures it, and the true gates will be the "praise," or renown, which it has among the nations of the earth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>).

Whether the sun and moon will continue to exist or not is beyond the prophet's ken - he makes no announcement on the subject; sufficient for him that the redeemed bask perpetually in a Divine radiance shed upon them by the "Father of lights" (see <a href="../../par/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>).

He is "the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And thy God thy glory</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>). God will not only be the Light of the Church, but her "Glory" and boast. As the Shechinah was the glory of the first, so "the eternal unchangeable light of Jehovah, with its peaceful gentleness and perfect purity" (Delitzsch), will be the glory of the final temple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/60-20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a></div><div class="verse">Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy sun...  thy moon</span>. That which is to thee instead of sun and moon - Jehovah's brightness<span class="cmt_word">. The days of thy mourning shall be ended</span>. Till the new Jerusalem descends from heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and Christ reigns personally over his people (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>), the Church is always, more or less, in a state of mourning. The Bridegroom is away (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>); his light shines upon his Church only by snatches; his Church feels itself unworthy of him - cold, unloving, stained with sin. Fasting, weeping, and mourning befit such a state of things. But in the final condition of the redeemed their mourning shall be ended, "sorrow and sighing shall have fled away" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>); God shall have "wiped away all tears from their eyes" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "There shall be no more death" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "no more curse" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>); "neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). The days of mourning shall be ended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a></div><div class="verse">Thy people also <i>shall be</i> all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy people also shall be all righteous</span>. Here the prophet touches the root of the matter. Pain and sorrow are the fruit of sin. Once let sin disappear, and sorrow goes with it. It is the foundation of all the glory and all the happiness of the redeemed in their Lord's final kingdom, that they are cleansed from all defilement of sin, and "are as the angels" (<a href="../../par/mark/12-25.htm">Mark 12:25</a>). They shall inherit the land; rather, <span class="accented">the earth -</span> the "new heavens and new earth" of Isaiah:17; 66:22. <span class="cmt_word">The branch of my planting</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a sprout of my planting</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a sprout which I have planted.
