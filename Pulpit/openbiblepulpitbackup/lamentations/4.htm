Not that the latter part of this description can have corresponded to literal fact. None of the hallowed jewels would have been treated with such indifference. The expression must be as figurative as the parallel one, "to cast pearls before swine," in <a href="../../par/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>. The precious stones are the "sons of Zion," who are compared to "fine gold" in ver. 2, precisely as they are in <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a> (comp. ver. 13," Thy sons, O Zion") to "the stones of a crown." They are called "stones of the sanctuary," in allusion, perhaps, to the precious stones employed in the decoration of the temple according to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>. But we may also translate <span class="accented">hallowed stones</span>, which better suits the figurative use of the phrase. Those, however, who adopt the literal interpretation, explain "the stones of the sanctuary" of the hewn stones of the fabric of the temple, which are described as "costly" in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>. But how can even a poet have represented the enemy as carrying these stones out and throwing them down in the street? On the other hand, in an earlier lamentation we are expressly told that the young children "fainted for hunger in the top of every street" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-19.htm">Lamentations 2:19</a>).

She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers." The description is literally true, if we add a detail not mentioned by the sacred poet. The eggs destined for hatching are deposited in a nest hole scratched in the sand, but there are other eggs laid, not in the sand, but near it, to all appearance forsaken. These eggs, however, are not exposed in simple stupidity, though they do often fall victims to violence. "They are intended for the nourishment of the newly hatched young ones, which in barren districts would at first find difficulty in procuring food" (Houghton, 'Natural History of the Ancients,' p. 198).

The rendering has been disputed, but without sufficient ground. "They that did eat at dainties," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pink at their dainty food, is forced. The Aramaic mark of the accusative need not surprise us in Lamentations (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Brought up in scarlet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">borne upon scarlet; i.e.</span> resting upon scarlet-covered couches.

The rendering of the Authorized Version is lexically possible, but is intrinsically improbable.

How is the language of the second part to be accounted for? It will help us to an answer if we observe that the later Jews seem to have acquired an exorbitant confidence in their national future ever since the Book of Deuteronomy had become as it were canonical in the reign of Josiah. "The temple of Jehovah" was ever in their mouths (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>), and the strong outward regard paid to the directions of the Law seemed to them to justify their believing in the fulfilment of its promises. And, in fact, the grand deliverance of Jerusalem in the reign of Hezekiah might, even without this misunderstanding of Deuteronomy, have inspired a firm faith in the security of Jerusalem. A sacred poet had already, on the occasion of that deliverance, declared of the holy city that "God upholdeth the same forever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>), and also (in vers. 4, 5) used the same hyperbole as the author of this lamentation to express the wide reaching interest felt in the fortunes of Jerusalem.

But we are nowhere else told that the spiritual leaders of the people, in these closing years of the Jewish state, were guilty of shedding innocent blood, unless this is to be inferred from the incident related in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7</a>, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">They have wandered <i>as</i> blind <i>men</i> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the prophets and priests. <span class="cmt_word">Wandered as blind</span> men. The leaders of the people are blinded by ignorance, for they know not the only true way of averting calamity, and by passion, for they have not that "eye" of the soul (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22, 23</a>) which alone enables a man to see the good and the right course for himself individually, The" wandering," or, rather, "staggering" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>, Authorized Version), however, may also refer to the panic stricken condition of those self. deceived deceivers when overtaken by God's punishment; comp. "wine of reeling" (Authorized Version, "astonishment"), <a href="../../par/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>; also the prophecies in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-12.htm">Jeremiah 23:12</a>. The doubt is whether  "have wandered" refers to some period before the final catastrophe, or to the consternation produced by that awful surprise. The latter view seems the more probable. <span class="cmt_word">They have polluted themselves,</span> etc. Their acts of violence have been continued to the very end of their term of power. Their garments are still stained with blood when the summons to depart into exile reaches them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/4-15.htm">Lamentations 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">They cried unto them, Depart ye; <i>it is</i> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <i>there</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They cried unto them,</span> etc. As they leave the city they are pursued by the maledictions of those whom they have oppressed.

The cry with which the leper was directed to warn off passengers, lest they should become infected (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>). There may be an allusion to this, but, though commonly accepted, the view is not certain, as the" leper" in the present case is not the person who raises the cry, but those who meet him. <span class="cmt_word">When they fled away and wandered.</span> The clause is difficult. If the text is correct, Keil's explanation may perhaps pass, "When they fled away, (there) also they wandered," alluding to the "wandering" ascribed to them with a somewhat different shade of meaning in the preceding verso. In any case there ought to be a fuller stop than a comma after "touch not," which words close the first of the two parallel lines of which the verse consists. But very probably "when" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ki</span>) is an intrusion, and we should begin the second line thus: "They fled, they also wandered about." <span class="cmt_word">They said among the heathen,</span> etc. Even in their place of exile they found no rest (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>). This is better than understanding "the heathen" (literally, <span class="accented">the nations</span>) to mean "the Chaldean army," and the place of sojourn prohibited to be Jerusalem.

The Chaldeans were either within the city or without. If within, they would not need literally to "hunt the steps" of the Jews; if without, they had not war engines adequate to shooting the inhabitants at some distance. Probably the expressions are metaphorical; they are similar to those used in <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>, immediately after which we meet with such a purely poetical phrase as, "They have cut off my life in the pit [Authorized Version, 'dungeon'], and cast a stone upon me" (see note on Lamentations 3:52-56).

A similar conception of the king was generally prevalent in antiquity. Most of all among the Egyptians; but, even in imperial Rome, we find Seneca ('De Clementia,' 1:4, quoted by Archbishop Seeker, in Blayney) declaring, "Ille (Princeps) est spiritus vitalis, quem haec tot millia (civium) trahunt." For the Jewish, or Old Testament, conception, see <a href="../../par/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>, where (as the Septuagint shows) "his people" and "his anointed" are used almost synonymously. <span class="cmt_word">Was taken in their pits.</span> A figure from hunting (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-13.htm">Lamentations 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>).
