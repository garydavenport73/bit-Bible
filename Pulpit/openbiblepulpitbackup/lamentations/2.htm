The wearer of a crown was regarded in the East as nearer to divinity than ordinary mortals; in some countries, indeed, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Egypt, almost as an incarnation of the deity.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <i>that were</i> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The beginning of the verse seems slightly out of order (see the Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">And slew all</span> that were <span class="cmt_word">pleasant</span>, etc. The correct rendering is, <span class="accented">And slew all that was pleasant to the eye: in the tent of the daughter of Zion he poured out his fury like fire.</span> The Authorized Version (following the Targum) seems to have thought that the youth of the population alone was intended. But, though Ewald also adopts this view, it seems to limit unduly the meaning of the poet. By "tent" we should probably understand "dwelling," as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>, and often; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a>, "the tent of David;" <a href="../../par/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>, "the tent of Joseph." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/2-5.htm">Lamentations 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was as an enemy: he hath swallowed,</span> etc. The threefold division of the verse is, unfortunately, concealed in the Authorized Version, owing to the arbitrary stopping. The grouping suggested by the Massoretic text is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The Lord is become an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel;<br />He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed all his strongholds;<br />And hath increased in the daughter of Judah moaning and bemoaning."</span> The change of gender in the second line is easily explicable. In the first case the poet is thinking of the city; in the second, of the people of Israel. The rendering "moaning and bemoaning" is designed to reproduce, to some extent, the Hebrew phrase, in which two words, derived from the same root, and almost exactly the same, are placed side by side, to give a more intense expression to the idea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <i>if it were of</i> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violently taken away;</span> rather, <span class="accented">violently treated; i.e.</span> broken up. <span class="cmt_word">His tabarnacle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his booth.</span> "Tent" and "dwelling" are interchangeable expressions (see ver. 4); and in the Psalms "booth" is used as a special poetic synonym for tent when God's earthly dwelling place, the sanctuary of the temple, is spoken of (so <a href="../../par/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>). The Authorized Version, indeed, presumes an allusion to the proper meaning of the Hebrew word, as if the poet compared the sanctuary of Jehovah to a pleasure booth in a garden. It is, however, more natural to continue, <span class="accented">as a garden</span>, the sense of which will be clear from <a href="../../par/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12, 13</a>. The Septuagint has, instead, "as a vine" - a reading which differs from the Massoretic by having one letter more (<span class="accented">kaggefen</span> instead of <span class="accented">kaggan</span>). This ancient reading is adopted by Ewald, and harmonizes well with <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>); but the received text gives a very good sense. "Garden" in the Bible means, of course, a plantation of trees rather than a flower garden. <span class="cmt_word">His places of the assembly;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his place of meeting</span> (<span class="accented">with God</span>). The  word occurs in the same sense in <a href="../../par/psalms/74-3.htm">Psalm 74:3</a>. It is the temple which is meant, and the term is borrowed from the famous phrase, <span class="accented">ohel mo'edh</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; comp. 25:22).

The shouts of triumph of the foe are likened to the festal shouts of the temple worshippers (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a></div><div class="verse">Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their heart cried unto the Lord,</span> etc. "Their heart" can only mean "the heart of the people of Jerusalem." For the expression, comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>, "My heart and my flesh cry aloud to the living God." To avoid the rather startling prosopopoeia in the next clause, Thenius supposes a corruption in the group of letters rendered "wall," and attaches the corrected word to the first clause, rendering thus: "Their heart crieth unto the Lord in vain; O daughter of Zion, let tears run down," etc. Another resource, which also involves an emendation, is that of Ewald, "Cry with all thy heart, O wall of the daughter of Zion." <span class="cmt_word">O wall,</span> etc. The prosepopoeia is surprising, but is only a degree more striking than that of ver. 8 and <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>.
