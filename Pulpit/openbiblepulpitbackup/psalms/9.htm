The thanks are special for a great deliverance - a deliverance from some heathen enemy (vers. 5, 15), who has been signally defeated and almost exterminated (vers. 5, 6). It has been conjectured that the subjugation of Ammon (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26-31</a>) is the occasion referred to ('Speaker's Commentary'); but the expectation of further attack (vers. 17-20) scarcely suits this period, when David's wars were well-nigh over. Perhaps the earlier victory over Ammon and Syria (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-14</a>), which was followed by the renewed invasion of the same nations in conjunction with "the Syrians beyond the river" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>), is more likely to have drawn forth the composition. I will show forth all thy marvellous works; rather, I <span class="accented">will tell forth</span>, or I <span class="accented">will recount all thy wondrous deeds.</span> Not necessarily miracles, but any strange and unexpected deliverances, such as the recent one (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4</a>).

God's favour, which is secured by the justice of his cause, gives him victory after victory. <span class="cmt_word">Thou surest in the throne judging right.</span> While the late battle raged, God sat upon his heavenly throne, administering justice, awarding defeat and death to the wrong-doers who had wantonly attacked his people, giving victory and glory and honour to those who stood on their defence against the aggressors.

When God would rebuke, be punishes; when he punishes, by so doing he rebukes. Thou hast destroyed the wicked; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst destroy.</span> Thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. If taken literally, this should mean extermination, and so some explain (Hengstenberg, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'); but some allowance must be made for the use of hyperbole by a poet. None of the nations with which David contended suffered extinction or extermination.

It is better to translate, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">The enemy are come to an end</span>; <span class="accented">they are desolate for ever</span> - a continuance of the hyperbole already noticed in the preceding verse. And thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them; rather, <span class="accented">and as for the cities thou hast destroyed</span>, <span class="accented">their very memory has perished.</span> This could only be an anticipation. It was fulfilled in the complete disappearance from history of the names of Zoba, Beth-rehob, and Tob, after the victory described in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13, 14</a>.

David's use of the metaphor is reasonably ascribed to his having "often experienced safety in such places, when fleeing from Saul" (Hengstenberg; see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). A refuge in times of trouble; literally, <span class="accented">in times in trouble</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in times that are steeped in trouble" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-10.htm">Psalm 9:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that know thy Name will put their trust in thee</span>. "To know the Name of God is to know him according to his historical manifestation; when one hears him named, to call to remembrance all that he has done. His name is the focus in which all the rays of his actions meet" (Hengstenberg). All who "know God's Name" in this sense will be sure to "put their trust in him," since his historical manifestation shows that he is thoroughly to he depended on. <span class="cmt_word">For thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee</span>. Never in the past, so far as David knew, had God forsaken those who faithfully clung to him. They might be tried, like Job; they might be "hunted upon the mountains," like David himself; they might even have the sense of being forsaken (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>); but they were not forsaken nevertheless. God "forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-11.htm">Psalm 9:11</a></div><div class="verse">Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing praises to the Lord</span>. Having praised God himself (vers. 1, 2), and declared the grounds upon which his praises rest (vers. 3-10), David now calls upon all faithful Israelites to join him in his song of thanksgiving. "Sing praises unto the Lord," he says, <span class="cmt_word">which dwelleth in Zion.</span> Who is enthroned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">on</span> the mercy-seat between the cherubim in the tabernacle, now set up upon Mount Zion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1-17</a>). The date of the psalm is thus to some extent limited, since it must have been composed subsequently to the transfer of the ark to Jerusalem. Declare among the people his doings. In the original "among the peoples" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not the people of Israel only, but all the surrounding nations. David is possessed with the conviction that the revelation of God made to Israel is not to be confined to them, but through them to be communicated to "all the ends of the earth" - to the heathen at large, to all nations (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-49.htm">Psalm 18:49</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/66-4.htm">Psalm 66:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11, 19</a>, etc.).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a></div><div class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <i>which I suffer</i> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy upon me, O Lord!</span> The consideration of God's mercies in the past, and especially in the recent deliverance, leads the psalmist to implore a continuance of his mercies in the future. He is not yet free from troubles. There are still enemies who afflict and threaten him - "heathen" who seek to "prevail" against him (vers. 19, 20), and perhaps already domestic enemies, especially the "sons of Zeruiah," causing him anxiety. <span class="cmt_word">Consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">my trouble</span> (or, <span class="accented">my affliction</span>) <span class="accented">from my haters.</span> Vers. 17, 19, 20 show that the heathen are especially intended (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-15.htm">2 Samuel 10:15-19</a>). Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Thou that continually (or, habitually) art my Support in the extremity of peril," "lifting me up" even from the very "gates of death." (For other mentions of "the gates of death," see <a href="../../par/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-18.htm">Psalm 107:18</a>.) Classical writers speak of "the gates of darkness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in almost the same sense (Eurip., 'Hec.,' 1. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a></div><div class="verse">That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion</span>. The "daughter of Zion" is, of course, Jerusalem. Compare "daughter of Babylon" (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-8.htm">Psalm 137:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-42.htm">Jeremiah 50:42</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>), "daughter of the Chaldeans" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1, 5</a>), "daughter of Edom" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>), "daughter of Gallim" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>). Hengstenberg is probably right in understanding "in the gates" as "<span class="accented">within</span> the gates," since, as he observes, "God's praise is not to be celebrated <span class="accented">in</span> the gates, amid the throng of worldly business, but in the temple." The references in the ' Speaker's Commentary' do not bear out the statement there made, that "public mournings and public thanksgivings were proclaimed  in the gates." <span class="cmt_word">I will rejoice in thy salvation</span>; or, <span class="accented">that I may rejoice</span> (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">The heathen are sunk down in the pit <i>that</i> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made</span>. It is uncertain whether the writer here reverts to the judgment already executed (vers. 3-6), or with the eye of faith sees as past the judgment which he confidently anticipates (vers. 19, 20). Whichever he intends, there can be no doubt that he means it to be understood that the stratagems of the enemy brought about (or would bring about) their downfall. In the net which they hid is their own foot taken. A second metaphor, expressing the same idea as the preceding (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-8.htm">Psalm 35:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/141-10.htm">Psalm 141:10</a>).

The two clauses are grammatically distinct, though no doubt closely connected in their meaning. God makes himself known - manifests his character, by the judgments which he executes, shows himself just, perhaps severe, certainly One who "will not at all acquit the wicked" (<a href="../../par/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands</span>. Some translate, "he snareth the wicked," or, "by snaring the wicked" - the special way in which God manifests himself (see Kay, p. 31; 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 190). Higgaion. This word is found in three other places only, viz. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; and <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-61.htm">Lamentations 3:61</a>. In the first it is translated "meditation," and has clearly that meaning; in the second it is supposed to mean "a gentle strain:" in the third it seems best rendered by "musing" or "reflection." Here it stands by itself, as a sort of rubrical direction, like the following word, "Selah." Some suppose it a direction to the choir to play a gentle strain of instrumental music as an interlude; others regard it as enjoining upon the congregation a space of quiet "meditation" (see Hengstenberg, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>; and compare Professor Alexander's work, 'The Psalms translated and explained,' p. 45). <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span> (see the comment on Psalm 3:2).
