<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a></div><div class="verse">Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye him, all his angels</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20, 21</a>). As the angels occupy the first rank in creation, and have the most to praise God for, they are fitly called upon to commence the song of jubilation. The praises of God must form their chief occupation through all eternity. <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye him, all his hosts</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all his host</span>. In the "host of God" are included beings of inferior rank to angels - "ministers of his that do his pleasure" (<a href="../../par/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>).

Frequent changes of person, when no doubt can arise as to the meaning, are a sort of Hebrew idiom. They give liveliness and variety. <span class="cmt_word">For he commanded, and they were created</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 15</a>, etc.). All creation sprang into being at the word of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-8.htm">Psalm 33:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-6.htm">Psalm 148:6</a></div><div class="verse">He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath also established them forever and ever</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-37.htm">Psalm 89:37</a>). The expression, "forever and ever," must not be pressed. It means "for all time" - while heaven and earth endure - but does not imply an absolute perpetuity. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath made a decree which shall not pass</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which shall not pass away</span> (see the Revised Version; and comp <a href="../../par/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-25.htm">Jeremiah 33:25</a>).

The counterpart of the clause in ver. 1, "Praise ye the Lord from the heavens." Earth must join with heaven in the praise of God. <span class="cmt_word">Ye dragons</span>; or, "ye sea-monsters" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>, where the same word is used). Hengstenberg translates by "whales;" but all the greater sea-animals are probably included. <span class="cmt_word">And all deeps</span>. The extreme "ocean depths" are meant - "lower deeps," in certain parts of what was commonly known as "the great deep" (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a></div><div class="verse">Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fire and hail.</span> By "fire," in this combination, we must understand "lightning," or rather the various electrical phenomena accompanying storms in the East, which are sometimes very strange and terrible. <span class="cmt_word">Snow and vapors</span>; rather, <span class="accented">vapor</span>. The mist so often accompanying snowstorms is probably the "vapor" intended. <span class="cmt_word">Stormy wind fulfilling his word</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-9.htm">Psalm 148:9</a></div><div class="verse">Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mountains, and all hills</span>. The later psalmists are great admirers of" mountains." Perhaps the fiat and monotonous Babylonian plains led them to appreciate the beauties of a landscape like that of Palestine (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/83-14.htm">Psalm 83:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/114-4.htm">Psalm 114:4, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-5.htm">Psalm 144:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fruitful trees</span>; rather, <span class="accented">fruit trees</span>; literally, <span class="accented">trees of fruit</span>. The Babylonian palms may have swept across the writer's remembrance; but probably the vine, the olive, and the fig, which were among the chief glories of Palestine, were in his mind principally. <span class="cmt_word">And all cedars</span>. Babylonia had had no "cedars." When the exiles returned, the beauty of the cedar broke upon them as a sort of new revelation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-10.htm">Psalm 148:10</a></div><div class="verse">Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beasts, and all cattle</span>. There is a gradual ascent - from inanimate to animate things, from the "beasts" of the field to domesticated animals; from such animals to man (vers. 11, 12). <span class="cmt_word">Creeping things</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24, 25, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And flying fowl</span>; literally, <span class="accented">bird of wing</span>. The intention is to include, under a few heads, all animate creation.

"Kings," "princes," and "judges" represent the upper classes of society; "peoples," or "nations," all the remainder. Together, they include the whole race of mankind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-12.htm">Psalm 148:12</a></div><div class="verse">Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Both young men, and maidens</span>; <span class="cmt_word">old men, and children</span>. All mar. bind, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., of each sex and of every age. The obligation to praise God lies upon all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-13.htm">Psalm 148:13</a></div><div class="verse">Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory <i>is</i> above the earth and heaven.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them praise the Name of the Lord</span>. This is the burden of the entire psalm (see especially ver. 5, and comp. vers. 1-4, 7, and 14). <span class="cmt_word">For his Name alone is excellent</span>; or, "exalted" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/12-4.htm">Isaiah 12:4</a>). The exaltation of God's Name is effected mainly by the praises which his rational creatures render to him. <span class="cmt_word">His glory is above the earth and heaven</span>. (On God's "glory," see <a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-5.htm">Psalm 57:5, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-2.htm">Psalm 63:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-17.htm">Psalm 89:17</a>, etc.) "Earth and heaven" is an unusual phrase; the terms are commonly inverted. Here, perhaps, the order may be accounted for by the law of climax. "His glory is not only above the earth, but even above the heavens." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/148-14.htm">Psalm 148:14</a></div><div class="verse">He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; <i>even</i> of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He also exalteth the horn of his people</span>. Great as God is, his greatness does not separate him from his human creatures. On the contrary, it makes the union between himself and them closer. His might enables him to confer benefits on his people - to "exalt their horn;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to increase their glory and their strength, and set them up above their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">The praise of all his saints.</span> The construction is doubtful. Some regard "praise" as in apposition with "horn," and understand that God, by exalting the "horn" (power) of his saints, exalts also their "praise" or "renown." Others imagine an ellipse, and translate, "Praise belongs to all his saints" (Kay); or, "Seemly is praise for all his saints" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him.</span> The "children of Israel" are nearer to God than others, since he has taken them to himself as his own peculiar people, and both "draws nigh" to them (<a href="../../par/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>), and draws them near to him (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Praise ye the Lord</span> (comp. ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/147.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 147"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 147" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/149.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 149"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 149" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
