These would present themselves to the exiles as "rivers." <span class="cmt_word">There we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</span> The exiles had their leisure hours - they were not kept by their masters at hard work continually. During these leisure hours they <span class="accented">naturally</span> "sat down" by the rivers of Babylon, as the most pleasant and attractive places. They brought their harps with them (ver. 2), with some idea, perhaps, of indulging in mournful strains. Grief, however, overpowered them - Zion came to their recollection-and they could do nothing but weep. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a></div><div class="verse">We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof</span>. The superfluous "harps" were "hung" up upon the trees that grew by the watercourses. These are called "willows," or, according to some, "poplars," but were probably of a different species from any of the trees that grew in Palestine. The chief Babylonian tree was the palm, which grew in the greatest luxuriance along the courses of all the streams (Herod., 1:193; Atom Man., 24:3; Zosim., 3. pp. 173-179). Tamarisks, poplars, and acacias were also common, but true "willows" hardly appear to have ever been a product of the country. The '<span class="accented">arabah</span> of our author was probably either a poplar or a tamarisk. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a></div><div class="verse">For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us <i>required of us</i> mirth, <i>saying</i>, Sing us <i>one</i> of the songs of Zion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song</span>; literally, <span class="accented">words of song</span>. The oppressors break into the retired gathering of their captives, and "require of them a song" - demand roughly and rudely to be entertained with the foreign music, which is perhaps sweeter than their own, or at any rate more of a novelty. <span class="cmt_word">And they that wasted us required us mirth</span>.  Not only was "a song" wanted but a joyous song - one that would wake feelings of mirth and gladness in those who heard it. Saying, <span class="cmt_word">sing us one of the songs of Zion</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sing us frown a song of Zion</span>. The captives had, no doubt, spoken of the joyous strains which they had been wont to pour forth in their own city upon festive occasions. Their conquerors demand a specimen, but are repulsed with the words of the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/137-4.htm">Psalm 137:4</a></div><div class="verse">How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?</span> The "songs of Zion" are Jehovah's songs, used in his worship, suited only for religious occasions. It would be desecration to sing them "in a strange land," among strange people, not to call forth devotional sentiment, but to gratify curiosity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a></div><div class="verse">If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <i>her cunning</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning</span>; literally, <span class="accented">let my right hand forget</span>; but the words supplied in the Authorized Version are necessary to bring out the sense, which is, "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, so far as to desecrate thy sacred songs by making them an entertainment for the heathen, may I never have power to strike a note again!" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/137-6.htm">Psalm 137:6</a></div><div class="verse">If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</span> Let me be deprived of the power of song. What was wished in the preceding verso with respect to the power of instrumental performance is here wished with respect to the vocal organs. <span class="cmt_word">If I prefer not Jerusalem</span> <span class="cmt_word">above my chief joy.</span> This seems to be the true sense, and is equivalent to "If I prefer not Jerusalem above aught else." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a></div><div class="verse">Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase <i>it</i>, rase <i>it, even</i> to the foundation thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember</span>, <span class="accented">O Lord</span>, <span class="accented">to the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem</span>. "The day of Jerusalem" is the day of her fall, when Edom took part with her enemies, and rejoiced at her destruction (see <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). The psalmist prays God to "remember" this to Edom, and requite it upon her (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/132-1.htm">Psalm 132:1</a>, where the same expression is used in a good sense). <span class="cmt_word">Who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "destroy the city utterly - leave not one stone upon another." The enmity between Edom and Israel was of the intensest character (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7-22</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-5</a>).

The desolation of Babylon began with its capture by Cyrus, but was not completed for many centuries. In the Archaemenian period it was one of the chief cities of the empire. Even under the Parthians it was still a flourishing town. But from the time of Isaiah's prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1-22</a>) it was a doomed city, and in the eyes of a devout Jew already "desolate." <span class="cmt_word">Happy shall he</span> <span class="cmt_word">be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. happy shall he be that completes thy destruction, and the destruction of thy people.
