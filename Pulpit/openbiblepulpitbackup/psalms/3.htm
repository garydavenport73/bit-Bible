We arc told, in the Book of Samuel, that "the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>), and again, "Absalom, and <span class="accented">all the people</span>, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15</a>). Ahithophel proposed to attack David with twelve thousand men only (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>), but the actual number which went against him must have been far larger, for some twenty thousand men, chiefly, no doubt, Absalom's partisans, fell in the battle (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7</a><span class="cmt_word">). Many are they that rise up against me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that rebel against me, and rise up in arras to make war upon me" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-48.htm">Psalm 18:48</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/44-5.htm">Psalm 44:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/59-1.htm">Psalm 59:1</a>, etc.).

Partisans of Absalom would see in David's expulsion from his capital a Divine Nemesis (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>), and regard it as quite natural that God should not help him. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. There is no traditional explanation of this word. The LXX. rendered it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> which is said to mean "a change of the musical tone;" but it is against this explanation that <span class="accented">selah</span> occurs sometimes, as here, at the end of a psalm, where no change was possible. Other explanations rest wholly on conjecture, and are valueless.

As God had raised up David to the throne (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), and prospered him in his wars (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>), and exalted him above all the other kings of the period, so he was well able now, if he so willed, to restore him to his place and re-establish him in the monarchy (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>).

"the hilt of his holiness" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>). Though David is in exile at Mahanaim (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>), his thoughts revert to Jerusalem, to the holy hill of Zion, and the ark of God, which he has there" set in its place" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>); and he knows that God, who "dwelleth between the cherubim" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), will hear him, though so far off. <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span> (see the comment on ver. 2).

"I, for my part," he says, "confident in God, calmly laid me down and slept; I did not allow the danger which I was in to interfere with my repose at night." Others, probably, were less trustful. <span class="cmt_word">I awaked</span>. When morning came, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, I awoke, as usual, from quiet and refreshing slumbers. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord sustained me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">sustaineth me.</span> Now and always I am sustained by the Almighty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set <i>themselves</i> against me round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people</span>. (On the vast multitude of people that had collected to attack the fugitive king, see the comment on ver. 1.) David, however, did not fear them. Like Asa (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>) and Judas Maccabeus (1 Macc. 3:18), he knew that there was no zeal might in ,' the multitude of an host" (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). God could save equally with many or with few, and against many or against few (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That have set themselves against me round about;</span> or, <span class="accented">ranged themselves against me</span> (Kay) - a military term (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies <i>upon</i> the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, O Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-6.htm">Psalm 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-19.htm">Psalm 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-12.htm">Psalm 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1</a>). This call is generally made when God's forbearance towards his enemies is thought to have been excessive, and his tolerance of sinners too great. <span class="cmt_word">Save me, O my God</span>. David was in imminent danger. "All Israel" had come against him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-15.htm">2 Samuel 16:15</a>). He was short of supplies (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>). He was doubtful how God was disposed towards him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25, 26</a>). It was a time when, unless God would save, there could be no hope. Hence the intense earnestness of his prayer. <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek-bone</span>. Heretofore, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, thou hast always taken my part - thou hast smitten mine enemies, and given me victory over them, and by breaking their jaw-bones thou hast taken away from them all power to hurt (see <a href="../../par/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>). The reference is, of course, to David's long series of victories, as those over the Philistines (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>), over Moab (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), over Hadadezer, King of Zobah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3, 4</a>), over the Syrians of Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>), over the Edomites (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13, 14</a>), over the Ammonites (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7-14</a>), and over the "Syrians beyond the river" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-6.htm">Psalm 58:6</a>). The ungodly, enemies alike of David and of God, are represented as wild beasts whose weapons are their jaws and teeth. Let God break these, and they are harmless. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">Salvation <i>belongeth</i> unto the LORD: thy blessing <i>is</i> upon thy people.

David is not deterred, by the revolt of almost the whole people against him, from commending them to God, entreating God's blessing upon them, and desiring their welfare. He echoes Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-31.htm">Exodus 32:31, 32</a>); he anticipates Christ (<a href="../../par/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
