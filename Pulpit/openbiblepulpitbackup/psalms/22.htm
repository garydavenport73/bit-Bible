St. Matthew has put it on record that this text was actually cited by the scribes and elders who witnessed the Crucifixion, and applied to our Lord in scorn (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-43.htm">Matthew 27:43</a>).

But he whom David prefigured, his Antitype, was desexed, was alone - "All the disciples forsook him and fled" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>) - he was truly one that "had no helper."

Bashan, the richest pasture-g"round of Palestine, produces the largest and strongest animals (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-18.htm">Ezekiel 39:18</a>).

An extreme and agonizing thirst sets in - the secretions generally fail - and the saliva especially is suppressed, so that the mouth feels parched and dry.

Two evangelists (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-24.htm">John 19:24</a>) note the fulfilment of the prophecy in the conduct of the soldiers at the crucifixion of Christ. The circumstance is reserved for the final  touch in the picture, since it marked that all was over; the Victim was on the point of expiring; he would never need his clothes again.

If he prayed, even on the cross, to be delivered from it, the prayer must have been offered with the reservations previously made in Gethsemane, "If it be possible" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>); "If thou be willing" (<a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>); "Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt." The human will in Christ was in favour of the deliverance; the Divine will, the same in Christ as in his Father, was against it. My darling - literally, <span class="accented">my only one</span> - from the power of the dog. By "my darling" there is no doubt that the soul is intended, both here and in <a href="../../par/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>. It seems to be so called as the most precious thing that each man possesses (see <a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>). "The dog" is used, not of an individual, but of the class, and is best explained, like the "dogs" in ver. 16, of the executioners.

Still, the adversaries are round about him - the "dogs," the "lions," and the "strong bulls of Bashan," now showing as ferocious wild cattle, menacing him with their horns. But all the Sufferer's feelings are changed. The despondent mood has passed away. He is not forsaken. He has One to help. In one way or another he knows himself - feels himself - delivered; and he passes from despair and agony into a condition of perfect peace, and even exultation. He passes, in fact, from death to life, from humiliation to glory; and at once he proceeds to show forth his thankfulness by a burst of praise. The last strophe of the psalm (vers. 22-31) is the jubilant song of the Redeemer, now that his mediatorial work is done, and his life of suffering "finished" (<a href="../../par/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a></div><div class="verse">I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will declare thy Name unto my brethren</span>. The thought of the brethren is uppermost. As, when the body was removed, loving messages were at once sent to the disciples (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>), so, with the soul of the Redeemer in the intermediate state, the "brethren" are the first care. God's Name, and all that he has done - the acceptance of the sacrifice, the effectuation of man's salvation - shall be made known to them (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee</span>. He will join with them in praising and adoring his Father, so soon as circumstances allow (compare the Eucharist at Emmaus, <a href="../../par/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-23.htm">Psalm 22:23</a></div><div class="verse">Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel</span>. "All Israel:" all the people of God are called upon to join in the praise which the Sea will henceforth offer to the Father through eternity. The praise of God is to be joined with the fear of God, according to the universal teaching of Scripture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-24.htm">Psalm 22:24</a></div><div class="verse">For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">afflicted</span>. The Father might seem by his passivity to disregard his Son's affliction; but it was not really so. Every pang was marked, every suffering sympathized with. And the reward received from the Father was proportionate (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, "Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death;" and <a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-11</a>, "He became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; <span class="accented">wherefore</span> God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every name: that at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father"). <span class="cmt_word">Neither hath he hid his face from him; but</span> <span class="cmt_word">when he cried unto him, he heard.</span> There was no real turning away, no real forsaking. Every cry was heard, and the cries were answered at the fitting moment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-25.htm">Psalm 22:25</a></div><div class="verse">My praise <i>shall be</i> of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation</span>. The phraseology is that of the Mosaic dispensation, with which alone David was acquainted. But the fulfilment is in those services of praise where, whenever Christ's disciples are gathered together, there is he in the midst of them. <span class="cmt_word">I will pay my vows before them that fear him</span>. "Vows," in the strict sense of the word, are scarcely meant; rather "devotions" generally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a></div><div class="verse">The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The meek shall eat and be satisfied</span>. In the Eucharistic feasts of Christ's  kingdom it is "the meek" especially who shall eat, and be satisfied, feeling that they have all their souls long for - a full banquet, of the very crumbs of which they are not worthy. <span class="cmt_word">They shall praise the Lord that seek him</span>. The service shall be emphatically one of praise. <span class="cmt_word">Your heart shall live for ever</span>. The result shall be life for evermore; for the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, worthily received, preserve men's bodies and souls to everlasting life.

A repetition of the idea contained in the preceding clause. (For the fulfilment, the history of missions must be consulted.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a></div><div class="verse">For the kingdom <i>is</i> the LORD'S: and he <i>is</i> the governor among the nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the kingdom is the Lord's</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1</a>). Christ has taken the kingdom, and even now rules on the earth - not yet wholly over willing subjects, but over a Church that is ever expanding more and more, and tending to become universal. And he is the Governor among the nations. Not the Governor of one nation only, but of all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-29.htm">Psalm 22:29</a></div><div class="verse">All <i>they that be</i> fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship</span>. The Christian feast is not for the poor and needy only, like Jewish sacrificial feasts, but for the "fat ones" of the earth as well - the rich and prosperous. As Hengstenberg observes, "This great spiritual feast is not unworthy of the presence even of those who live in the greatest abundance: it contains a costly viand, which all their plenty cannot give - a viand for which even the satisfied are hungry; and, on the other hand, the most needy and most miserable are not excluded" ('Commentary on the Psalms,' vol. 1. p. 396). <span class="cmt_word">All they that go down to the dust shall bow before him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all mortal men what-soever - all that are on their way to the tomb - shall bow before Christ, either willingly as his worshippers, or unwillingly as his conquered enemies, made to lick the dust at his feet. <span class="cmt_word">And none can keep alive his own soul</span>. Life is Christ's gift; the soul cannot be kept alive except through <span class="accented">him</span>, by his quickening Spirit (<a href="../../par/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53, 63</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a></div><div class="verse">A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A seed shall serve him</span>. The Church is founded on a rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. So long as the world endures, Christ shall always have worshippers - a "seed" which will "serve" him. <span class="cmt_word">It shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be accounted to the Lord for a generation</span>. If we accept this rendering, we must understand that the seed of the first set of worshippers shall be the Lord's people for one generation, the seed of the next for another, and so on. But it is suggested that the true meaning is, "This shall be told of the Lord to generation after generation" (so Hengstenberg, Kay, Alexander, and our Revisers).
