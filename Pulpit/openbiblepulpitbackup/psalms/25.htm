The Hebrew phrase does not mean a temporary raising of the heart to God, but a permanent setting of the affections on him  (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>).

The prayer passes from the particular to the universal. What David desires for himself he desires also for all the true servants of God - all who wait on him, look to him, seek for indications of his will (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/123-2.htm">Psalm 123:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them he ashamed which transgress without cause</span>. Let shame be the portion, not of thy servants, but of thy adversaries - of those who transgress (or rebel) without reasonable cause. Such persons deserve to be brought to shame. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Show me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths</span>. An echo of the prayer of Moses when his people were rebellious at Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>), reiterated by David in <a href="../../par/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>, and perhaps again in <a href="../../par/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a> (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a>). Man is so wanting in spiritual understanding, so morally blind and ignorant, that, unless enlightened from on high, he cannot discern aright the "way of godliness;" he does not know at any given moment what God would have him to do. Hence it is the constant prayer of every religious man that God will "lighten his darkness;" "make his way plain before his face;" "show him the path that he should walk in;" enable him to see, if no more, at any rate the next step which it is his duty to take. The idea has been beautifully expressed by a modern poet - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom<br />Lead thou me on.<br />The night is dark, and I am far from homo;<br />Lead thou me on.<br />Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see<br />The distant scene; one step enough for me."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-5.htm">Psalm 25:5</a></div><div class="verse">Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou <i>art</i> the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lead</span> <span class="cmt_word">me in thy truth, and teach me.</span> "Thy truth" would seem to mean here "the true, right path" - the "way of godliness." The prayer is that God will both teach this to the psalmist and "lead him in it" - cause him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to walk in it, and never stray from it, so long as he lives. <span class="cmt_word">For thou art the God of my salvation</span>. Thou art the God from whom alone I obtain salvation, and to whom alone, therefore, I am bound to pray for everything on which salvation depends - as, for instance, light and guidance. <span class="cmt_word">On thee do I wait all the day</span>. In prayer for these blessings, I wait on thee all the day long. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-6.htm">Psalm 25:6</a></div><div class="verse">Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they <i>have been</i> ever of old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy loving-kindnesses.</span> Past mercies form a ground for the expectation of future blessings. God's character cannot change; his action as one time will always be consistent and harmonious with his action at another. If he has been kind and merciful to David in the past, David may count on his continuing the same in the future. <span class="cmt_word">For they have been ever of old</span>. Not lately only, or to David only, have his mercies been shown, but through all past time, to all his servants, from of old. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-7.htm">Psalm 25:7</a></div><div class="verse">Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions</span>. Job thought that God counted against him the "iniquities of his youth" (<a href="../../par/job/13-26.htm">Job 13:26</a>); David, with greater faith and a deeper insight into the true character of God, can ask with confidence that his may not be reckoned against him. An earthly father does not remember them against his son. How much less will our heavenly Father! <span class="cmt_word">According to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sake, O Lord!</span> Still, put me not from thy mind. "Remember thou me" always - but in the light of thy tender mercy, with the rays of thy love streaming over me and hiding the deformities of my transgressions. Do this "for thy goodness' sake," <span class="accented">i.e. because</span> thou art essential Goodness, perfect Tenderness, perfect Love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a></div><div class="verse">Good and upright <i>is</i> the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Good and upright is the Lord</span>. A transition. From prayer the psalmist turns to reflection, and meditates awhile (vers. 8-10) on the character and ways of God. God is, indeed, "good," as he has implied in the preceding verse - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, kind, tender, gentle, merciful; but he is also "upright" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) - just, straight, strict, undeviating from the path of right. As Bishop Butler observes, "Divine goodness, with which, if I mistake not, we make very free in our speculations, may not be a bare single disposition to produce happiness, but a disposition to make the good, the faithful, the honest man happy" ('Anal.,' 1:2, p. 41) - s disposition, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to be just as well as merciful to distribute happiness by the canon of right. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will he teach sinners in the way</span>. He will not abandon sinners - this is his "goodness;" but will reclaim them, chasten them, make them to walk in his way - this is his uprightness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a></div><div class="verse">The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The meek will he guide in judgment</span>. It is only such sinners as are "meek" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. humble, submissive, contrite, teachable - that God will take in hand and teach. The proud and perverse he will  leave to their own devices, but the meek he will guide in the paths of righteousness, <span class="cmt_word">and the meek will he teach his way</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">All the paths of the LORD <i>are</i> mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies</span>. Mercy and truth will meet together (<a href="../../par/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>) in the case of those who, however they may have sinned, meekly submit themselves to God's guidance, and thenceforth keep his covenant and his testimonies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-11.htm">Psalm 25:11</a></div><div class="verse">For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it <i>is</i> great.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy Name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity</span>. The psalmist here resumes the attitude of prayer, which he had laid aside in ver. 8. The" sins of his youth," and his other "transgressions," which he had asked God to forget (ver. 7), rankle in his own memory, and force him to cry out again and again for pardon (see ver. 18; <a href="../../par/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39-8.htm">Psalm 39:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/41-4.htm">Psalm 41:4</a>, etc.). Here he beseeches God to pardon him "for his Name's sake," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the honour of his Name, that his mercy may Be known far and wide, and his goodness cause all the world to praise him. He enforces his plea by the confession, For it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his iniquity) is great; so great, that his need of forgiveness is excessive: so great, that to forgive it will be truly Godlike; so great, that, unless forgiven, he must be lost. (For his "great sin," see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4-17</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-12.htm">Psalm 25:12</a></div><div class="verse">What man <i>is</i> he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way <i>that</i> he shall choose.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What man is he that feareth the Lord?</span> Once more we have a series of reflections (vers. 12-15) - first, with respect to the God-fearing man.

This is, of course, the right way - the way of God's commandments (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-30.htm">Psalm 119:30, 173</a>). God shall make his way plain to the God-fearing man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-13.htm">Psalm 25:13</a></div><div class="verse">His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His soul shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">dwell at case;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his soul shall dwell in bliss</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall enjoy, while on earth, blessings of every kind. <span class="cmt_word">And his seed shall inherit the earth</span>. His posterity after him shall be continued upon the earth, and shall prosper (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/37-11.htm">Psalm 37:11, 22, 29</a>). There is a tendency in righteousness to "inherit the earth," only held in check by accidental and (it may be) temporary circumstances (see Butler's' Analogy,' pt. 1. ch. 3, pp. 78, 79). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a></div><div class="verse">The secret of the LORD <i>is</i> with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him</span>. God favours those who fear him with secret and confidential communion (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>). He "comes unto them, and makes his abode with them" (<a href="../../par/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>), and "teaches them" (<a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>), and enlightens them, and leads them in his way, and learns them (ver. 5), and "seals their instruction" (<a href="../../par/job/33-16.htm">Job 33:16</a>). And he will show them his covenant; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> make them see the full force of it, since his "commandment is exceeding broad" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-96.htm">Psalm 119:96</a>).

David is always looking to God (<a href="../../par/psalms/141-8.htm">Psalm 141:8</a>), waiting for him (<a href="../../par/psalms/40-1.htm">Psalm 40:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/62-1.htm">Psalm 62:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-3.htm">Psalm 69:3</a>, etc.), expecting his providences, anticipating his deliverances (<a href="../../par/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/5-11.htm">Psalm 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-3.htm">Psalm 9:3</a>, etc.).

The approach of peril is regarded as a sign that God has "turned away his face." He is besought, therefore, to turn towards one who needs his aid. <span class="cmt_word">For I am</span> <span class="cmt_word">desolate and afflicted</span> (comp. vers. 17, 18). The affliction evidently comes from enemies, either foreign or domestic (vers. 2, 19); but its nature is not further indicated.

Of his sins he was at this time deeply conscious (vers. 7, 11) and deeply repentant. Probably they included his great sin (see the comment on ver. 11).

Scarcely his own inherent integrity and uprightness, the want of which he has deplored when confessing that his iniquity is great (ver. 11). Rather an integrity and uprightness whereto he hopes to attain, by the grace of God, in days to come - an integrity and uprightness for which he "waits" For I wait on thee.
