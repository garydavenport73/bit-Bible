The expressions used imply a signal defeat, which, though not mentioned in the historical books, harmonizes with the account given in 1 Kings of the severe treatment of Edom by Joab. From the fact of the defeat the psalmist infers the ground of it - God's displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">O turn thyself to us again;</span> rather, <span class="accented">O restore to us</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. make restoration to us) <span class="accented">again</span> (see the Revised Version).

Selah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast given a tanner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth.</span> So most commentators. But the ancient rendering, recently revived by Professor Cheyne, is perhaps preferable. According to this, the meaning is, "Thou hast indeed given a banner to them that fear thee (see <a href="../../par/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>), but only that they may flee before the bow" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1ffd;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). On the last occasion that the banner had been lifted, it had seemed to be, not so much a rallying point, as a signal for dispersion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/60-5.htm">Psalm 60:5</a></div><div class="verse">That thy beloved may be delivered; save <i>with</i> thy right hand, and hear me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me;</span> rather, <span class="accented">hear us</span>. From complaint (vers. 1-4) the psalmist abruptly turns to prayer, thus closing the first strophe with a gleam of hope. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a></div><div class="verse">God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - Appeal is next made in God's promises. Some suppose that a Divine oracle had been recently given to David himself, and that he here records the words of it. But, in that case, it is difficult to account for the despondent tone of vers. 1-4. Hengstenberg's explanation seems preferable, that David now encourages himself by a "reference to the general aspect of the assurances given in the Pentateuch in regard to the possession of the land of Canaan in its widest extent, and to victory over hostile neighbours," and that he has his eye especially on the blessing of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>) and the blessing of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>). If these assurances are to be depended on, Israel cannot now be about to succumb to Edom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God hath spoken in his holiness;</span> or, <span class="accented">promised by his holiness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/89-35.htm">Psalm 89:35</a>). As God is holy, he cannot falsify his promises. <span class="cmt_word">I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. I will distribute Canaan among my people - both the western region, of which Shechem was the chief town (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>), and the eastern, which contained "the valley of Succoth" (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>). God, having assigned the whole laud to his people (<a href="../../par/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14, 15</a>), "meted it out" through Joshua, his servant, and gave to each tribe its inheritance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a></div><div class="verse">Gilead <i>is</i> mine, and Manasseh <i>is</i> mine; Ephraim also <i>is</i> the strength of mine head; Judah <i>is</i> my lawgiver;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.</span> Gilead was an old name for the territory beyond the Jordan (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>), especially the more northern portion of it. Manasseh had a portion of this territory assigned to him (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39-42</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>). But Manasseh had also a large inheritance on the western side of Jordan (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7-11</a>). It is not quite clear whether both the divisions of Manasseh, or the eastern one only, is here intended. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim also is the strength of mine head.</span> Ephraim was the most important of the tribes next to Judah, and held the central position in the western region, forming the main strength of the northern kingdom after the separation under Jeroboam (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-2.htm">Isaiah 7:2, 5, 9, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-21.htm">Isaiah 9:21</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-7.htm">Hosea 5:7-14</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4-10</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Judah is my lawgiver</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17</a>); <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

The subjugation of Moab was prophesied by Balaam (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), and effected by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Over Edom will I cast out my shoe</span>. The reference to <a href="../../par/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7, 8</a>, which is commonly made, is very doubtful. Probably no more is intended than that Edom will be a slave of so low a rank as only to clean the shoes of its master. The subjugation of Edom, like that of Moab, had been prophesied by Balaam (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</span> The context will not allow of this rendering, since Philistia, like the other enemies of Israel, must be triumphed over, and not triumph.

Edom is to be conquered, for so God has premised (ver. 8). But how? Who will lead out Israel's armies? Will God, who has lately "cast Israel off"? If not, it must he man. But "vain is the help of man" (ver. 11). So the call is made that God will give help in the trouble - and with the call comes full confidence - and the triumphant cry goes forth, "Through God we shall do valiantly; for  he it is that shall tread down our enemies" (ver. 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who will bring me into the strong city?</span> The "strong city" of Edom was Sela, "The Cliff" - now Petra.
