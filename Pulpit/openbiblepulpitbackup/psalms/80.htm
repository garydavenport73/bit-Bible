The mention of "Joseph" shows at once that the thoughts of the psalmist are fixed on the northern kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Thou that dwellest between the cherubims.</span> The two cherubim that overshadowed the mercy seat seem to be meant. Shine forth; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "show thyself - manifest thy might" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/80-2.htm">Psalm 80:2</a></div><div class="verse">Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come <i>and</i> save us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh</span>. "Ephraim" and "Manasseh" form a natural expansion of the "Joseph" of the preceding verse; but it is difficult to understand the mention of "Benjamin" here. Hengstenberg suggests, and both Canon Cook and Professor Cheyne seem to accept the suggestion, that it was only a small portion of Benjamin which adhered to Judah at the division of the kingdoms, the greater part attaching itself to the rival power. <span class="cmt_word">Stir up thy strength</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "rouse thyself from thine inaction - come forward, and make thy might to appear." <span class="cmt_word">And come and save us;</span> literally, <span class="accented">come for salvation to us.</span> The writer identifies himself with the rebel tribes, who, after all, are a part of God's people - a part of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a></div><div class="verse">Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn us again, O God</span>; or, <span class="accented">restore us</span> - "bring us back" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bring those of us who are in exile (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) back to our country. <span class="cmt_word">And cause thy face to shine</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-16.htm">Psalm 31:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1</a>).

"Against the prayer" means "in spite of the prayer," or "notwithstanding the prayer." Ordinarily, God forgives, and ceases from his anger, as soon as the afflicted one makes earnest prayer to him. But this is not always so. A time comes when his wrath cannot be appeased - when "there is no remedy" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>). Evil has been persisted in too long.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-19.</span> - The poet, to excite God's compassion, proceeds to depict Israel as it was and as it is. He adopts the figure of a vine, perhaps suggested to him by the description of Joseph in the dying speech of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>), and carries out his metaphor, in nine consecutive verses, with great beauty and consistency. Isaiah's description of Israel as a vineyard (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) is somewhat similar. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt</span>. The history of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> begins with the Exodus. The nation was transplanted from Egypt into a soil better fitted for it by the loving hand of God, in order that it might have ample room to grow up and develop itself freely. God "brought it out of Egypt," not merely in the exercise of his ordinary providence over humanity, but by an active exertion of his Almighty power, and a long series of miraculous manifestations, without which the transfer could not have been effected. He then cast out the heathen, and planted it - drove out, that is, before Israel the seven nations of the Hivites, Hittites, Gergashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, and Jebusites, and, having driven them out, "planted" in his own people (see <a href="../../par/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thou preparedst <i>room</i> before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou preparest room before it.</span> The "room" was made by the removal of the heathen inhabitants, who were first greatly weakened by Rameses III., and then driven out by Joshua. <span class="cmt_word">And didst cause it to take deep root;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and it took deep</span> root, as in the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">And it filled the land</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>). Possession was taken of the whole land, not at once (<a href="../../par/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27-36</a>), but slowly and surely; the furthest limits being reached in David's time (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a></div><div class="verse">The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof <i>were like</i> the goodly cedars.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hills were covered with the shadow of it.</span> The "hills" intended are probably those of the south - the hill country of Judah - since the clauses which follow designate the boundaries towards the north, west, and east. (So Hengstenberg, Kay, Professor Cheyne, and others.) <span class="cmt_word">And the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the goodly cedar trees were covered with their branches.</span> The cedars of Lebanon are intended. They marked the boundary line on the north. The psalmist calls them "cedars of God," by a strong, but not unprecedented (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>), hyperbole.

The "boar out of the wood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wild boar - is probably Tiglath-pileser (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>), or the Assyrian power generally. <span class="cmt_word">And the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</span> Other beasts, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> other enemies of Israel, join in and share in the plundering (see above, ver. 6, and comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/80-15.htm">Psalm 80:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch <i>that</i> thou madest strong for thyself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the stock.</span> (So Kay, Cheyne, and the Revised Version.) Some, however, regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> as a verb, and translate, "Establish that which thy right hand has planted" (see the LXX., Michaelis, Hupfeld, Canon Cook, and others). <span class="cmt_word">And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the son</span>, which <span class="accented">may</span> mean the offshoot (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>). Is this offshoot Ephraim? or is the entire vine, all Israel, intended?

The climax has been reached, and the matter is too serious for rhetorical treatment. The nation typified by the vine, the Israel of God, is perishing - perishing "at the rebuke of God's countenance" - because his favour is withdrawn from them. Unless God steps in to save, destruction is certain.
