Whom wilt thou accept as a sojourner in thy tent, to be near to thee, and consort with thee? <span class="cmt_word">Who shall dwell</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> whom wilt thou permit to dwell) <span class="cmt_word">in thy holy hill?</span> The "tabernacle" and the "holy hill" of Zion are, of course, not to be understood literally. They are figurative expressions, pointing to the Divine presence and favour, and the blessedness of abiding in them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness</span>. An upright walk is the first requisite (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/26-3.htm">Psalm 26:3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). Such a walk involves the doing of righteousness, not, of course, in absolute perfection, but with a sincere intention, and so as to have "the answer of a good conscience towards God" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And speaketh the truth in his heart.</span> Not "<span class="accented">from</span> his heart," as in the Prayer-book Version, which would make the reference one to mere truth of speech, but "in his heart," which points to internal truthfulness - that truthfulness "in the hidden council-chamber of the soul," which "holds no parley with what is false" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/15-3.htm">Psalm 15:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>He that</i> backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that backbiteth not with his tongue</span>. Among the negative virtues the first place is given to the observance of the ninth commandment, probably because to  err in this respect is so very common a fault (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor doeth evil to his neighbour;</span> rather, to <span class="accented">his friend</span>, or <span class="accented">his companion</span> - a different word from that used at the end of the verse, and implying greater intimacy. There is special wickedness in injuring one with whom we are intimate. <span class="cmt_word">Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour</span>. The good man does not, even when it is true, spread an ill report concerning his neighbour. He prefers to keep silence, and let the report die out (see <a href="../../par/exodus/33-1.htm">Exodus 33:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a></div><div class="verse">In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. <i>He that</i> sweareth to <i>his own</i> hurt, and changeth not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whose eyes a vile person is contemned</span>. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Ewald, Hupfeld, Hengstenberg, and the Revised Version. Others prefer to translate, "He is despised in his own eyes, [and] worthless" (Abort Ezra, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Kay, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Either rendering furnishes a good sense; but the law of parallelism is very decidedly in favour of the former. As the righteous man honors those who fear God, so he contemns those who are vile or worthless. He is no respecter of persons. Men's outward circumstances are nothing to him. He awards honour or contempt according to men's moral qualities. But he honoreth them that fear the Lord. "It is no common virtue," says Calvin, "to honour pious and godly men, since in the opinion of the world they are often as the offscouring of all things (1 Corinthans 4:13)? He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. The righteous man, if he happens to have sworn to do something which it turns out will be to his own hurt, nevertheless keeps his engagement (comp <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used in the same sense). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/15-5.htm">Psalm 15:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>He that</i> putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these <i>things</i> shall never be moved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that putteth not out his money to usury</span>. Usury, when one Israelite borrowed of another, was strictly forbidden by the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>). When the borrower was a foreigner, it was lawful (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-20.htm">Deuteronomy 33:20</a>); and no discredit can attach to the practice, so long as the rate of interest charged is moderate (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/25-27.htm">Matthew 25:27</a>). Here the writer contemplates only such usury as was forbidden by the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Nor taketh reward against the innocent</span>; refuses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to take a bribe, either as judge or witness, when a charge is made against an innocent person. The contrary conduct was widely practised by the Israelites in later times (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>; Hoe. 4:18; <a href="../../par/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, etc.), and prevails generally in the East to the present day. <span class="cmt_word">He that doeth these things shall never be moved</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>). He shall continue "steadfast, unmovable," having God "at his right hand," as his Protector and Sustainer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../psalms/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Psalm 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Psalm 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../psalms/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Psalm 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Psalm 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
