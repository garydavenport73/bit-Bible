The devout soul is always athirst for God. David felt his severance from the tabernacle and its services as a sort of severance from God himself, whom he was accustomed to approach through the services of the sanctuary (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25, 26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the living God</span>. This title of God occurs only in one other psalm (<a href="../../par/psalms/84-2.htm">Psalm 84:2</a>); but it was a title familiar to David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-27.htm">1 Samuel 17:27</a>). It is first used in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>; and, later, in <a href="../../par/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-4.htm">Isaiah 37:4, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-36.htm">Jeremiah 23:36</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>. It expresses that essential attribute of God that he is "the eternal Life" (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>), the Source and Origin of all life, whether angelic, human, or animal. <span class="cmt_word">When shall I</span> <span class="cmt_word">come and appear before God?</span> Appearance in the tabernacle must here be specially meant, but with this David connects his return to God's favour and to the light of his countenance (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a></div><div class="verse">My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where <i>is</i> thy God?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>, "Thou feedest them with the <span class="accented">bread of tears</span>;" and Ovid, 'Metaph.,' 10:288, "Cure dolorque animi, lachrymaeque, <span class="accented">alimenta</span> fuere" - "They who grieve deeply do not eat; they only weep;" yet they live on, so that their tears appear to be their aliment). David's grief at being shut out from God's presence is intensified by the reproaches of his enemies, "Where is thy God?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Is he not wholly gone from thee? Has he not utterly cast thee off?" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>).

"Deep sorrow," as Hengstenberg remarks, "tries to lose itself in the recollection of the happier past." I pour out my soul in me. "The heart <span class="accented">pours itself out</span>, or melts in any one, who is in a manner dissolved by grief and pain." David does not alleviate his sorrow, but aggravates it, by thinking of the happy past. "Nessun muggier dolore che ricordarsi di tempo felice nella miseria" (Dante). <span class="cmt_word">For I</span> <span class="cmt_word">had gone</span> (rather, <span class="accented">how I went</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that</span> <span class="cmt_word">kept holy day</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12-19</a>).

O my soul. The spirit, or higher reason, rebukes the "soul," or passionate nature, for allowing itself to be so depressed, and seeks to encourage and upraise it. <span class="cmt_word">And why art thou so disquieted in me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">Why dost thou make thy moan over me</span>? literally, <span class="accented">make a roaring noise like the sea</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/46-3.htm">Psalm 46:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hope thou in God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-22.htm">Psalm 33:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39-7.htm">Psalm 39:7</a>, etc.). For I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. Another reading assimilates the refrain here to the form which it takes in ver. 11 and in <a href="../../par/psalms/43-5.htm">Psalm 43:5</a>. But, as Hengstenberg observes, Hebrew poets, and indeed poets generally, avoid an absolute identity of phrase, even in refrains (see <a href="../../par/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/56-4.htm">Psalm 56:4, 11</a>, etc.).

Misfortunes "come not in single file, but in battalions." The imagery may be taken from the local storms that visit the Trans-Jordanic territory (see Lynch, 'Expedition to the Jordan and the Dead Sea;' and Wilson, 'Negeb,' pp. 26, 27). <span class="cmt_word">All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-7.htm">Psalm 88:7, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-7.htm">Psalm 144:7</a>).

God does not forget even when he most seems to forget (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>).
