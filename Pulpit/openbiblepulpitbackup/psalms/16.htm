It does not appear that the writer is threatened by any special danger. He simply calls upon God to continue his protecting care. <span class="cmt_word">For in thee do I put my trust.</span> In thee, and in thee only. Therefore to thee only do I look for protection and preservation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-2.htm">Psalm 16:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>O my soul</i>, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou <i>art</i> my Lord: my goodness <i>extendeth</i> not to thee;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord</span>. The ordinary Hebrew text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>, "thou hast said," requires the insertion of "O my soul," or something similar. But if we read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> with a large number of manuscripts, with the LXX., the Vulgate, the Syriac, and most other versions, no insertion will be necessary. The meaning will then be, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have said to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou art my Lord</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">adonai</span> - "my Lord and Master." <span class="cmt_word">My goodness extendeth not to thee</span>. This meaning cannot be elicited from the Hebrew words. <span class="accented">Tobah is</span> not "goodness," but "prosperity" or "happiness" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/106-5.htm">Psalm 106:5</a>); and '<span class="accented">aleyka</span> is best explained as "beside thee," "beyond thee." The psalmist means to say that he has no happiness beside (or apart from) God. (So Ewald, Hengstenberg, Cheyne, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' and the Revised Version.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>But</i> to the saints that <i>are</i> in the earth, and <i>to</i> the excellent, in whom <i>is</i> all my delight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But to the saints that are in the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">it is for the saints.</span> It (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my prosperity) is granted me for the advantage of the saints that are in the land; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of all the true Israelites. "I hold it in trust for them" (Kay). And to (rather, for) the excellent, in whom is all my delight. And, <span class="accented">especially</span>, I hold it in trust for "the inner circle of the excellent ones," in whom God takes pleasure (<a href="../../par/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>), and in whom therefore I also "delight." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a></div><div class="verse">Their sorrows shall be multiplied <i>that</i> hasten <i>after</i> another <i>god</i>: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god</span>. This is the only note of sadness in the entire psalm, and it is inserted to add force by contrast to the joyous outburst in ver. 5. If men would not cleave to Jehovah, but would "hasten after" - or perhaps it should be translated "wed themselves to" - another god (see <a href="../../par/exodus/2-16.htm">Exodus 2:16</a>, the only other place where the word occurs), then they must not expect "prosperity," or joy of any kind. Their "sorrows will be multiplied;" distress and anguish will come upon them (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>); they will have to pay dear for their apostasy. <span class="cmt_word">Their drink offerings of blood will I not offer.</span> Drink offerings of actual  blood are not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, and there is very little evidence of their having been offered by any of the heathen nations, though it is conjectured that they may have been employed in the worship of Moloch. It is therefore best to explain the expression, as here used, metaphorically, as drink offerings as hateful as if they had been of blood (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor take up their names into my lips</span>. By "their names" we must understand the names which they used - those by which they called their gods. The Law forbade the mention of these names by Israelites (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-13.htm">Exodus 23:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD <i>is</i> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is the Portion of mine inheritance</span>. God had said to Aaron, when he gave him no special inheritance in Canaan, "I am thy Part and thine Inherit-ante among the children of Israel" (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>). David claims the same privilege. God is his "Portion," and he needs no other. <span class="cmt_word">And of my cup</span>. A man's "cup" is, in Scripture, his lot or condition in life (<a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>) - that which is given him to drink. David will have God only for his cup. Thou maintainest my lot; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou makest it firm and sure (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/30-6.htm">Psalm 30:6</a>, "In my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant <i>places</i>; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places</span>. The "lines" which marked out the place of his abode (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-5.htm">Joshua 17:5</a>). These had fallen to him "in pleasant places" - in Jerusalem and its near vicinity. Yea, I have a goodly heritage. Some explain "heritage" here by the "inheritance" of ver. 5. But the word used is different; and it is most natural to understand David's earthly heritage, or lot in life. This, he says, is "pleasing" or "delightsome" to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-7.htm">Psalm 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bless the Lord, who hath given his counsel</span>. God has become David's "Counsellor" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>), makes suggestions to him which he follows, and so guides his life that he feels bound to praise and bless him for it. <span class="cmt_word">My reins also instruct me in the night seasons</span>. The reins, according to Hebrew ideas, are the seat of feeling and emotion. David is "instructed" or "stimulated" (Hengstenberg) to bless God by the feelings which stir within him as he lies awake at night - feelings, we must suppose, of affection and gratitude. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">I have set the LORD always before me: because <i>he is</i> at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set the Lord always before me</span>. I have brought myself, that is, to realize the continual presence of God, alike in happiness and in trouble. I feel him to be ever with me. <span class="cmt_word">Because he is at my right hand</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> close to me, ready to protect and save), <span class="cmt_word">therefore I shall not be moved</span>. Nothing will shake me or disturb me from my trust and confidence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth</span>. The thought of God's continual presence at his right hand causes David's "heart" to be "glad," and his "glory" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his soul, or spirit (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>), man's true glory - to rejoice. <span class="cmt_word">My flesh also shall rest in hope</span>. His "flesh" - his corporeal nature, united closely with his "heart" and "spirit" - rests, and will rest, secure, confident that God will watch over it, and make the whole complex man - body, soul, and spirit - to "dwell in safety" (<a href="../../par/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to Sheol</span>, or "to Hades." The confidence in a future life shown here is beyond that exhibited by Job. Job hopes that he may not always remain in Hades, but may one day experience a "change" or "renewal" (<a href="../../par/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a>); David is certain that his soul will not be left in hell. Hell (<span class="accented">Sheol</span>) is to him an "intermediate state," through which a man passes between his life in this world and his final condition in some blest abode. <span class="cmt_word">Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption</span>. The present Hebrew text has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e1;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>, "thy holy ones," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy saints generally; but the majority, of the manuscripts, all the ancient versions, and even the Hebrew revised text (the Keri) have the word in the singular number, thus agreeing with <a href="../../par/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>, which give us the translation, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and declare the psalmist to have spoken determinately of Christ. Certainly he would not have spoken of himself as "God's holy one." The translation of <span class="accented">shachath</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) by "corruption" has been questioned, and it has been rendered "the pit," or "the grave," but quite gratuitously. The LXX. have <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> as the equivalent; and the rabbinical commentators, giving it the same meaning, but expounding it of David, invented the myth that David's body was miraculously preserved from corruption. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence <i>is</i> fulness of joy; at thy right hand <i>there are</i> pleasures for evermore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wilt show me the path of life</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the path which leads to the Source and Centre of all life, even God himself - the way to heaven, in contrast with corruption and <span class="accented">Sheol. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In thy presence is fulness of joy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">satiety of</span> joy - enough, and more than enough, to satisfy the extremest cravings of the human heart.
