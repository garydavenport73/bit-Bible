If the interposition has been one of a striking and unusual character, if the relief has been great, the deliverance signal, the triumph accorded to his people extraordinary, then he "goes up with a shout" - amid the exulting cries and loud jubilations of rescued Israel. When the occasion is such as to call for a public manifestation of thanksgiving at the house of God (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-28.htm">2 Chronicles 20:28</a>), then he "goes up" also "with the sound of the trumpet," which was always sounded by the priests on great occasions of festal joy and gladness (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-14.htm">2 Kings 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-42.htm">1 Chronicles 16:42</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-6.htm">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-27.htm">2 Chronicles 29:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-35.htm">Nehemiah 12:35</a>).

Here the special instruction is that God is King over the whole earth, that he reigns over the heathen, and that the heathen shall also some time or other own his sovereignty.

At the great ingathering of the Gentiles into the Church, they would belong to him still more, since they would voluntarily place themselves under his rule (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3, 11, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">is greatly exalted</span>.
