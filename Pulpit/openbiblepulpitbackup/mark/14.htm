It was one and the same festival. The killing of the Paschal lamb took place on the first of the seven days during which the festival lasted, and during the whole of which they used unleavened bread. Josephus describes it as "the festival of the unleavened, called <span class="accented">Phaska</span> by the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests and the scribes.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3</a>) says, "The chief priests and the elders of the people." The two classes in the Sanhedrim who actually combined to put our Lord to death were those here mentioned by St. Mark. <span class="cmt_word">They sought how they might take him with subtlety</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and kill him</span>. It is, literally, <span class="accented">they were seeking</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>). The verb with its tense implies continuous and eager desire. They used subtlety, because they feared lest he should escape out of their hands. Moreover they feared the people, lest they should fight for him, and not suffer him to be taken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-2.htm">Mark 14:2</a></div><div class="verse">But they said, Not on the feast <i>day</i>, lest there be an uproar of the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they said</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) literally, <span class="accented">for they were saying - <span class="cmt_word"></span>Not during</span> <span class="cmt_word">the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the people.</span> The same cause induced them to avoid the time of the feast. The feast brought a great multitude of <span class="accented">Jews to</span> Jerusalem, amongst whom would be many who had received bodily or spiritual benefits from Christ, and who therefore, at least, worshipped him as a Prophet; and the rulers of the people feared lest these should rise in his defense. Their first intention, therefore, was not to destroy him until after the close of the Paschal feast; but they were overruled by the course of events, all ordered by God's never-failing providence. The sudden betrayal of our Lord by Judas led them to change their minds. For when they found that he was actually in their hands, they resolved to crucify him forthwith. And thus the Divine purpose was fulfilled that Christ should suffer at that particular time, and so the type be satisfied. For the lamb slain at the Passover was a type of the very Paschal Lamb to be sacrificed at that particular time, in the predetermined purpose of God; and to be lifted up upon the cross for the redemption of the world. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:3) tells us that they were gathered together "unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas." It was necessary to state his name, because the high priests were now frequently changed by the Roman power. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured <i>it</i> on his head.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he was in Bethany, in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">an alabaster</span>; as we say, "a glass," of a vessel made of glass - <span class="cmt_word">of ointment of spikenard very costly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head</span>. This anointing of our Lord appears to have taken place on the Saturday before Palm Sunday (see <a href="../../par/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>).  The anointing mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>) evidently has reference to some previous occasion. The narrative here and in St. Matthew and St. John would lead us to the conclusion that this was a feast given by Simon - perhaps in grateful acknowledgment of the miracle which had been wrought upon Lazarus. He is called "Simon the leper," probably because he had been a leper, and had been healed by Christ, although he still retained the name of "leper," to distinguish him from others named Simon, or Simeon, a common name amongst the Jews. <span class="accented">There came a woman.</span> This woman, we learn from St. John (<a href="../../par/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2, 3</a>), was Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The vessel, or cruse, which she had with her was made of alabaster, a kind of soft, smooth marble, which could easily be scooped out so as to form a receptacle for ointment, which, according to Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 13:3), was best preserved in vessels made of alabaster. The vessel would probably be formed with a long narrow neck, which could easily be broken, or crushed (the word in the original is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> so as to allow of a free escape for the unguent. The ointment was made of spikenard <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">nardi spicati.</span> If this is the true interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean that this ointment was made from a bearded plant mentioned by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:12), who says that the ointment made from this plant was most precious. The plant was called by Galen "nardi spica." Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> it would mean "genuine" ointment - ointment made from the flowers of the choicest kind of plant, pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:26) says that there was an inferior article in circulation, which he calls "pseudo-nard." The Syriac Peshito Version uses an expression which means the principal, or best kind of ointment. The anointing of the head would be the more usual mark of honor. It would seem most probable that Mary first wiped the feet of Jesus, wetting them with her tears, and then wiping off the dust, and then anointing them; and that she then proceeded to break the neck of the cruse, and to pour its whole contents on his head. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-4.htm">Mark 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there were some that had indignation</span> - the word in the original is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">ached with vexation - <span class="cmt_word"></span>among</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>themselves.</span> St. Mark says, "there were some;" avoiding any more particular mention of them. St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a>) says that the disciples generally had indignation. The murmuring seems to have been general. At length it found a definite expression in Judas Iscariot (see <a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-5.htm">Mark 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor.

It appears from St. John (<a href="../../par/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>) that the wants of the poor were carefully attended to by our Lord and his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">And they murmured against her</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); another very expressive verb in the original, <span class="accented">they growled at her</span>; <span class="accented">rebuked her vehemently.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-6.htm">Mark 14:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It appears from St. John (<a href="../../par/john/12-7.htm">John 12:7</a>) that our Lord here addressed himself pointedly to Judas in the words, <span class="cmt_word">Let her alone;...</span>  she hath wrought a good <span class="cmt_word">work on me,</span> a work worthy of all praise and honor. "What," says Cornelius a Lapide, "what more noble, than to anoint the feet of him who is both God and man? Who would not count himself happy, if it were permitted to him to touch the feet of Jesus and to kiss them?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-7.htm">Mark 14:7</a></div><div class="verse">For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Far ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">do them good: but me ye have not always</span>. The little clause, "whensoever ye will ye can do them good," occurs only in St. Mark. It is as though our Lord said, "The world always abounds with poor; therefore you always have it in your power to help them; but within a week I shall have gone from you, after which you will be unable to perform any service like this for me; yea, no more to see, to hear, to touch me. Suffer, then, this woman to perform this ministry now for me, which after six days she will have no other opportunity of doing." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She hath done what she could</span>. She seized the opportunity, which might not occur again, of doing honor to her Lord by anointing him with her very best. Our Lord might have excused this action, and have praised it as a practical evidence of her gratitude, her humility, and her love for him. But instead of dwelling on these things, he said, <span class="cmt_word">She hath anointed my body aforehand for the burying</span>. Our Lord here, of course, alludes to the spices and ointments with which the Jews wrapped up the bodies of their dead before their burial. Not that this was what Mary intended. She could hardly have dreamed of his death and burial so near at hand. But she was moved by the Holy Spirit to do this, at this particular time, as though in anticipation of his death and burial. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-9.htm">Mark 14:9</a></div><div class="verse">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, <i>this</i> also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). "Mnemosyne was the mother of the Muses, and so called because, before the invention of writing, a retentive memory was of the utmost value in every effort of literary genius" (Dr. Morison on St. Mark). When our Lord delivered this prediction, none of the Gospels had been written; nor  bad the gospel been preached at this time throughout the then known world. Now it has been published for more than eighteen centuries; and wherever, it is proclaimed, this deed of Mary's is published with it, in continual memory of her, and to her lasting honor. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-10.htm">Mark 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them</span>. The betrayal follows immediately after the anointing by Mary. We may suppose that the other disciples who had murmured on account of this waste of the ointment, were brought to their senses by our Lord's rebuke, and felt its force. But with Judas the case was very different. The rebuke, which had a salutary effect on them, only served to harden him. He had lost one opportunity of gain; he would seek another. In his cupidity and wickedness he resolves to betray his Master, and sell him to the Jews. So while the chief priests were plotting how they might destroy him, they found an apt and unexpected instrument for their purpose in one of his own disciples. Judas came to them, and the vile and hateful bargain was concluded. It marks the tremendous iniquity of the transaction that it was "one of the twelve" who betrayed him - not one of the seventy, but one of those who were in the closest intimacy and nearness to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-11.htm">Mark 14:11</a></div><div class="verse">And when they heard <i>it</i>, they were glad, and promised to give him money.

And they</span>,<span class="accented">when they heard it</span>, <span class="accented">were glad</span>; glad, because they saw the prospect of the accomplishment of their wishes; glad, because it was "one of the twelve" who covenanted to betray him. <span class="accented">They promised to give him money.</span> St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>) tells us the amount, namely, thirty pieces of silver, according to the prophecy of Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12</a>), to which St. Matthew evidently refers. These pieces of silver were shekels of the sanctuary, worth about three shillings each. This would make the whole amount about &pound;4 10s. of our money; less than half the value of the precious ointment with which Mary had anointed him. Some commentators, however, think that this was only an instalment of what they promised him if he completed his treasonable design. <span class="accented">How he might conveniently deliver him unto them.</span> St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>) explains this by saying, "in the absence of the multitude;" that is, when the people were not about him, and when he was in private with his disciples. And so he betrayed him at night, when he was alone with his disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover?</span> The first day of unleavened bread would begin on the evening of the Thursday (the 14th day of the month Nisan). <span class="accented">Where wilt thou that we prepare</span>? They do not inquire in what city or town. The Passover could not be sacrificed anywhere but in Jerusalem. The question was in what <span class="accented">house</span> it was to be prepared. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-13.htm">Mark 14:13</a></div><div class="verse">And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sendeth two of his disciples</span>. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>) informs us that these two were Peter and John. It is characteristic of St. Mark's Gospel throughout that Peter is never mentioned oftener than is necessary. <span class="cmt_word">Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water</span>. The bearing of the pitcher of water was not without its meaning. It was a solemn religious act preparatory to the Passover. This man bearing a pitcher of water was not the master or owner of the house. The owner is distinguished afterwards by the name <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or "goodman of the house." The owner must, therefore, have been a man of some substance, and probably a friend if not a disciple of our Lord. Tradition says that this was the house of John whose surname was Mark; and that it was in this house that the disciples were assembled on the evening of our Lord's resurrection, and where, also, they received the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, on the day of Pentecost. It was to this house that Peter betook himself when he was delivered by the angel out of prison. Hence it was known, as one of the earliest places of Christian worship, by the name of "Coenaculum Sion; "and here was built a church, called the Church of Sion. It was the oldest church in Jerusalem, and was called by St. Cyril, "the upper church of the apostles." (See Joseph Mode, p. 322.)

This would consist in obtaining the Paschal lamb, and taking it to the temple to be sacrificed by the priests. It would  then be brought to the house to be cooked; and the unleavened bread, the bitter herbs and the wine would have to be provided, and the water for purification. After all these preparations had been made, the two disciples would return to their Master.

Much had doubtless happened before our Lord said this; but St. Mark only records the important circumstances. These words of our Lord were uttered with great solemnity. The presence of the traitor was a burden upon his spirit, and cast a gloom over this usually joyous festival. A question here arises whether Judas remained to partake of the Holy Communion when our Lord instituted it. The greater number of the Fathers, and amongst them Origen, St. Cyril, St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and Bede, consider that he was present; and Dionysius says that our Lord's words to him, "That thou doest, do quickly," were intended to separate him from the rest of the twelve as one who had partaken unworthily; and that then it was that Satan entered into him, and impelled him onwards to this terrible sin.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-20.htm">Mark 14:20</a></div><div class="verse">And he answered and said unto them, <i>It is</i> one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, It is one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish</span>. St. Mark here uses the present participle (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), bringing the action close to the time when he was speaking. St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>) has (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) "he that dipped his hand," using the aorist form. St. Mark's form is the more graphic. The dish probably contained a sauce called <span class="accented">charoseth</span>, into which they dipped their food before eating it. The following appears to have been the order of the events: - First, our Lord, before he instituted the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, foretold that he would be betrayed by one of his disciples but only in general terms. Then came the eager question from them, "Is it I?" Then Christ answered that the traitor was he who should dip his hand together with him in the dish. But this did not bring it home to the individual, because several who sat near to him were able to dip with him in the dish. So that our Lord had as yet only obscurely and indefinitely pointed out the traitor. Then he proceeded to institute "the Lord's Supper;" after which he again intimated (<a href="../../par/luke/22-21.htm">Luke 22:21</a>) that "the hand of him that betrayed him was with him on the table." Upon this. St. Peter hinted to St. John, who was "reclining in Jesus' besom," that he should ask him to say definitely and by name who it was that should betray him. Our Lord then said to St. John, "He it is, for whom I shall dip the sop, and give it him" (<a href="../../par/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). Our Lord then dipped the sop, and gave it to Judas Iscariot. Then it was that our Lord said to Judas, "That thou doest, do quickly" (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) (<a href="../../par/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a>). Then Judas went straightway to the house of Caiaphas, and procured the band of men and officers for the completion of his horrible design.

Existence is no blessing, but a curse, to him who consciously and wilfully defeats the purpose of his existence. St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25</a>) here introduces Judas as asking the question, "Is it I, Rabbi?" And our Lord answers him affirmatively, "Thou hast said." This was probably said in a low voice. Had it been said so as to be heard by others, such as Peter and John, they might have risen at once to inflict summary vengeance upon the apostate traitor. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-22.htm">Mark 14:22</a></div><div class="verse">And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake <i>it</i>, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The last clause of this verse should be read thus: <span class="cmt_word">Take ye: this is my body</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The institution of this Holy Sacrament took place at the close of the Paschal supper, but while they were yet at the table. The bread which our Lord took would most likely be unleavened bread. But this does not surely constitute a reason why unleavened bread should be used ordinarily in the celebration of the Holy Communion. The direction of the Prayer-book of the English Church is wise and practical, "It shall suffice that the   Bread be such as is usual to be eaten." <span class="accented">This is my body</span>; that is, sacramentally. St. Augustine ('Sermo.,' 272) says, "How is the bread his body? and the cup, or that which the cup contains, how is that his blood? These are, therefore, called sacraments, because in them one thing is seen while another thing is understood" (quoted by Dr. Morison, p. 392).

Our Lord here refers to the time of the regeneration of all things, when the heavenly kingdom shall appear in the fullness of its glory; and when his disciples, who now feed upon him sacramentally and by faith, shall then eat at his table in his kingdom, and drink of the river of his pleasures for ever.

But on this occasion he did not return to Bethany. He had supped in Jerusalem. Besides, he knew that his hour was come.

This is a quotation from Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>), "Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd, and against the man that is my Fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the Shepherd." This passage brings out in a remarkable manner the Divine agency in the death of Christ. <span class="accented">The sheep shall be scattered abroad.</span> The disciples all forsook him and fled, when they saw him actually in the hands of his enemies. They felt doubtful for the moment whether he was indeed the Son of God. "They trusted that it was he who should redeem Israel;" but now their hopes gave way to fear and doubt. They fled hither and thither like frightened sheep. But God gathered them together again, so that when our Lord rose from the dead, he found them all in the same place; and then he revived their faith and courage. Our Lord and his disciples had no settled home or friends in Jerusalem; so they had no other place to flee to than that upper chamber, where, not long before, Christ had kept the Passover with them. The owner of that house was a friend; so thither they went, and there Christ appeared to them after his resurrection.

Our Lord had just distinctly stated that they would all be offended, and therefore these words of St. Peter were very presumptuous. Conscious of his own infirmities, he ought to have said, "I know that through my own infirmity this may easily happen. Nevertheless, I trust to thy mercy and goodness to save me." Just such is the Christian's daily experience. We often think that we are strong in the faith, strong in purity, strong in patience. But when temptation arises, we falter and fall. The true remedy against temptation is the consciousness of our own weakness, and supplication for Divine strength.

The "cockcrowing" was a term used for one of the divisions of the night (see <a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>).

He was, no doubt, sincere in all this, but he had vet to learn his own weakness. St. Hilary says on this, "Peter was so carried away by the fervor of his zeal and love for Christ, that he regarded neither the weakness of his own flesh nor the truth of his Master's word." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32</a></div><div class="verse">And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) - here again St. Mark's present gives force to the narrative - <span class="cmt_word">unto a place which was named Gethsemane</span>. A place (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is, literally, <span class="accented">an enclosed piece of ground</span>, generally with a cottage upon it. Josephus tells us that these gardens were numerous in the suburbs of Jerusalem. St. Jerome says that "Gethsemane was at the foot of the Mount of Olives." St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>) calls it a garden, or orchard (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The word "Gethsemane" means literally "the place of the <span class="accented">olive-press</span>," whither the olives which abounded on the slopes of the mountain were brought, in order that the oil contained in them might be pressed out. The exact position of Gethsemane is not known; although there is an enclosed spot at the foot of the western slope of the Mount of Olives which is called to this day <span class="accented">El maniye.</span> The real Gethsemane cannot be far from this spot. Our Lord resorted to this place for retirement and prayer, not as desiring to escape the death that awaited him. It was well known to be his favourite resort; so that he went there, as though to put himself in the way of Judas, who would naturally seek him there. <span class="cmt_word">Sit ye here, while I pray</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36</a>) says, "While I go yonder and pray."

These two Greek verbs are as adequately expressed above as seems possible. The first implies "utter, extreme amazement;" if the second has for its root <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "not at home," it implies the anguish of the soul struggling to free itself from the body under the pressure of intense mental distress. The three chosen disciples were allowed to be witnesses of this awful anguish. They had been fortified to endure the sight by the glories of the transfiguration. It would have been too much for the faith of the rest. But these three witnessed it, that they might learn themselves, and be able to teach others, that the way to glory is by suffering.

It was not the apprehension of the bodily torments and the bitter death that awaited him, all foreknown by him. It was the inconceivable agony of the weight of the sins of men. The Lord was thus laying "upon him the iniquity of us all." This, and this alone, can explain it. <span class="cmt_word">My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death</span>. Every word carries the emphasis of an overwhelming grief. It was then that "the deep waters came in," even unto his soul.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Abba, Father, all things <i>are</i> possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Abba, Father</span>. Some commentators suppose that our Lord only used the Hebrew or Aramaic word "Abba," and that St. Mark adds the Greek and Latin synonym (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>) for the benefit of those to whom he was writing. But it is far more natural to conclude that St. Mark is here taking his narrative from an eye and ear witness, St. Peter; and that both the words were uttered by him; so that he thus, in his agony, cried to God in the name of the whole human family, the Jew first, and also the Gentile. We can quite understand why St. Matthew, writing to Jews, gives only the Hebrew word. All things are possible unto thee. Speaking absolutely, with God nothing is impossible. But the Deity is himself bound by his own laws; and hence this was impossible, consistently with his purposes of mercy for the redemption of the world. The Lord himself knew this. Therefore he does not ask for anything contrary to the will of his Father. But it was the natural craving of his humanity, which, subject to the supreme will of God, desired to be delivered from this terrible load. <span class="cmt_word">Remove this cup from me</span>. The "cup," both in Holy Scripture and in profane writers, is taken to signify that lot or portion, whether good or evil, which is appointed for us by God. Hence St. John is frequently represented as holding a cup. Howbeit, <span class="cmt_word">not what I will, but what thou wilt</span>. Our Lord has no sooner offered his conditional prayer than  he subordinates it to the will of God. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>) here says, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done." Hence it appears that there was not, as the Monothelites taught, one will, partly human and partly Divine, in Christ; but there were two distinct wills, one human and the other Divine, both residing in the one Christ; and it was by the subjecting of his human will to the Divine that he wrought out our redemption. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-37.htm">Mark 14:37</a></div><div class="verse">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou?

So on the Mount of Transfiguration he says (<a href="../../par/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>) that they were "heavy with sleep." This rebuke, which St. Mark tells us here was pointedly addressed to Peter, seems to glance at his earnest protestations of fidelity made not long before. And our Lord calls him by his old name of Simon. In St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40</a>) it is less pointed; for there, while our Lord looks at Peter, he addresses them all. "He saith unto <span class="accented">-Peter</span>, <span class="accented">W</span>hat, could not <span class="accented">ye</span> watch with me one hour?" This is just one of those graphic little incidents which we may suppose St. Mark to have received directly from St. Peter.

The great temptation of the disciples at that moment was to deny Christ under the influence of fear.

Here our Lord graciously finds excuses for them. It is as though he said, "I know that in heart and mind you are ready to cleave to me, even though the Jews should threaten you with death. But I know also that your flesh is weak. Pray, then, that the weakness of the flesh may not overcome the strength of the spirit." St. Jerome says, "In whatever degree we trust to the ardor of the spirit, in the same degree ought we to fear because of the infirmity of the flesh."

The repetition of the same words shows his fixed determination to submit to the will of his heavenly Father. Although the human nature at first asserted itself in the prayer that the cup might pass from him; yet ultimately the human will yielded to the Divine. He desired to drink this cup of bitterness appointed for him by the will of God; for his supreme desire was that the will of God might be done.

But it is far more consistent with his usual considerate words to suppose that, sympathizing with the infirmity of his disciples, he simply advised them, now that his bitter agony was over, to take some rest during the brief interval that remained. It is <span class="accented">enough.</span> Some commentators have thought that the somewhat difficult Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) would be better rendered, <span class="accented">he is at a distance</span>; as though our Lord meant to say, "There is yet time for you to take some rest. The betrayer is some distance off." Such an interpretation would require a full. stop between the clause now rendered, "it is enough," and the clause, "the hour is come;" so that the passage would read, "Sleep on now, and take your rest; he (that is, Judas) is yet a good way off." Then there would be an interval; and then our Lord would rouse them up with the words, "The hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners." This interpretation all hangs upon the true rendering of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, which, although it might be taken to. mean "he," or "it is distant," is nevertheless quite capable of the ordinary interpretation, "it sufficeth." According to the high authority of Hesychius, who explains it by the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, it seems safer on the whole to accept the ordinary meaning, "It is enough."

It was so startling a fact that "one of the twelve" should be the betrayer of cur Lord, that this designation of Judas became linked with his name: "Judas, one of the twelve." He comes not only as a thief and a robber, but also as a traitor; the leader of those who were thirsting for Christ's blood. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-47.htm">Luke 22:47</a>) says that Judas "went before them," in his eagerness to accomplish his hateful errand. And with him a multitude (not a great multitude; the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> has not sufficient authority). But though not a great multitude, they would be a  considerable number. There would be a band of soldiers; and there would be civil officers sent by the Sanhedrim. Thus Gentiles and Jews were united in the daring act of arresting the Son of God. St. John (John 18:3) says that they had "lanterns and torches;" although the moon was at the full.

Why was Judas so anxious that Christ should be secured? Perhaps because he feared a rescue, or because he feared lest our Lord should hide himself by an exercise of his miraculous power; and so Judas might lose the thirty pieces of silver.

It is possible that this was the usual mode with which the disciples greeted Christ when they returned to him after any absence. But Judas abused this token of friendship, using it for a base and treacherous purpose. St. Chrysostom says that he felt assured by the gentleness of Christ that he would not repel him, or that, if he did, the treacherous action would have answered its purpose.

We learn from St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-10.htm">John 18:10</a>) that this was Peter. St. John also is the only evangelist who mentions the name (Malchus) of the high priest's servant. Malchus would probably be prominent amongst them. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-51.htm">Luke 22:51</a>) is the only evangelist who mentions the healing of the wound by our Lord.

Then follows that remarkable incident mentioned only by St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-4.htm">John 18:4-6</a>), "Jesus...  went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, was standing with them. When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground." The presence of Christ in his serene majesty overpowered them. There was something in his looks and manner, as he repeated these words," I am he," words often used before by him, that caused them to retreat backwards, and to prostrate themselves. It was no external force that produced this result. The Divine majesty flashed from his countenance and overawed them, at least for the moment. At all events, it was an emphatic evidence, both to his own disciples and to this crowd, that it was by his own will that he yielded himself up to them. Perhaps this incident fired the courage of St. Peter; and so, as they approached to take our Lord, he drew his sword and struck off the ear of Malchus. Then our Lord healed him. And then he turned to the multitude and said, "Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves, to seize me?"

This, as it stands in the original, is an incomplete sentence; in St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>) the sentence occurs in its complete form. In both cases it has been questioned whether the words are those of our Lord, or whether they are the comment of the evangelist. On the whole, it would seem more probable that they are our Lord's words, which seem almost required to conclude what he had said before. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a></div><div class="verse">And they all forsook him, and fled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they all left</span> <span class="cmt_word">him, and fled.</span> But soon afterwards two of them, Peter and John, took courage, and followed him to the house of the high priest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51</a></div><div class="verse">And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about <i>his</i> naked <i>body</i>; and the young men laid hold on him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain young</span> <span class="cmt_word">man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him</span>. St. Mark is the only evangelist who mentions this incident; and there seems good reason for supposing that he here describes what happened to himself. Such is the mode in which St. John refers to himself in his Gospel, and where there can be no doubt that he is speaking of himself. If the conclusion in an earlier part of this commentary be correct, that it was at the house to which John Mark belonged that our Lord celebrated the Passover, and from whence he went out to the Mount of Olives; what more probable than that Mark had been with him on that occasion, and had perhaps a presentiment that something was about to happen to him? What more likely than that the crowd who took Jesus may have passed by this house, and that Mark may have been roused from his bed (it was now a late hour) by the tumult. Having a linen cloth (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) cast about his naked body. The <span class="accented">sindon</span> was a fine linen cloth, indicating that he belonged to a family in good circumstances. It is an unusual word. In every other place of the New Testament where it is used it refers to the garment or shroud used to cover the  bodies of the dead. The <span class="accented">sindon</span> is supposed to take its name from Sidon, where the particular kind of linen was manufactured of which the garment was made. It was a kind of light cloak frequently worn in hot weather.

It shows how great was the panic in reference to Christ, and how great was the hatred of the Jews against him, that they endeavored to seize a young man who was merely following with him. It shows also how readily our Lord's enemies would have seized his own disciples if they had not taken refuge in flight.

This high priest was Caiaphas. But we learn from St. John (<a href="../../par/john/18-13.htm">John 18:13</a>) that our Lord was first brought before Annas, the father-in-law of Caiphas. Annas and his five sons held the high priesthood in succession, Caiaphas, his son-in-law, stepping in between the first and the second son, and holding the office for twelve years. It is supposed that it was in the house of Annas that the price of the betrayal was paid to Judas. Annas, though not then high priest, must have had considerable influence in the counsels of the Sanhedrim; and this will probably explain the fact of our Lord having been first taken to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/mark/14-54.htm">Mark 14:54</a></div><div class="verse">And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the high priest</span>. This court was the place where the guards and servants of the high priest were assembled. Our Lord was within, in a large room, being arraigned before the council. St. John informs us (<a href="../../par/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15</a>) that he himself, being known to the high priest, had gone in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; and that he had been the means of bringing in Peter, who had been standing outside at the door leading into the court. We now see Peter among the servants, crouching over the fire. The weather was cold, for it was early springtime; and it was now after midnight.

These words the false witnesses perverted; for they assigned to Jesus the work of destruction which he left to the Jews. He did not say," I will destroy;" but "Do ye destroy, and I will rebuild." Nor did he say, "I will build another;" but "I will raise it up," that is, from the dead; for St. John tells us that "he spake of the temple of his body," in which, as in a temple, there dwelt the fullness of the Godhead.. He might have said plainly, "I will rise from the dead;" but he chose to speak as in a parable. According to their witness, however, our Lord's words would appear as little more than an empty boast, certainly not as anything on account of which such a charge as they desired could be brought against him.

But Jesus answered nothing. It would have been a long and tedious business to answer such a charge, which involved a garbled and inaccurate statement of what he had said. It would have answered no good purpose to reply to an accusation so vague and inaccurate. Our Lord knew that, whatever his answer was, it would be twisted so as to make against him. Silence was therefore the most dignified treatment of such an accusation. Besides, he knew that his hour was come. The high priest now asks him plainly, <span class="cmt_word">Art</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou the Christ, the son of the Blessed?</span> Here he touches the point of the whole matter.

This answer of our Lord is full of majesty and sublimity. He is arraigned as a criminal, standing in the midst of the chief priests and scribes,his bitter enemies; and it is as though he said, "You, O Caiaphas, and you the chief priests and elders of the Jews, are now unjustly condemning me as a false prophet and a false Christ; but the day is at hand when I, who am now a prisoner at your judgment seat, shall sit on the throne of glory as the Judge of you and of all mankind.

The Greek verb here rendered "rent" implies violent dramatic action. The Jewish tunic was open under the chin, and large enough to receive the head, so that it could easily be placed over the shoulders, by inserting the head. When the wearer wished to give this sign of indignation or grief, he would seize the garment at this opening with both hands, and violently tear it asunder down to the waist. But it was unlawful for the high priest to do this in a private grief (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>). Some of the Fathers think that by this action Caiaphas involuntarily typified the rending of the priesthood from himself and from the Jewish nation.

"I hid not my face from shame and spitting" (Isaiah 1:61). <span class="cmt_word">And the officers received him with blows of their hands</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

It amounts to this: "So little do I know who this Jesus is, that I know not what you say or what you ask concerning him. I know not who or what he is or anything about him. A question has been raised as to the number of times that Peter denied our Lord. The narratives are best explained by the consideration that all the denials took place in the house of Caiaphas. Furthermore, the accounts of the evangelists may be reconciled thus: First, Peter denied the Lord in the court of the high priest, when he was first asked by the maidservant, as he sat over the fire (Matthew 24:69); secondly, he denied him with an oath; thirdly, when urged still more, he denied him with many oaths and execrations. The cock crew the first time after the first denial, when we read (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-71.htm">Matthew 26:71</a>) that he went out into the porch (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This crowing would be about one or two in the morning. The second crowing would not be until five or six. This shows us the length of time that the proceedings lasted. It was doubtless as Jesus through the court that he gave Peter that look of unutterable pain and grief which moved him at once to repentance.
