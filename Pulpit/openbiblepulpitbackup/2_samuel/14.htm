The preposition does not usually mean "toward," but "against," and is so rendered in ver. 13. The whole phrase occurs again only in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, and certainly there implies enmity. The whole attitude of David towards Absalom is one of persistent hostility, and, even when Joab had obtained his recall, for two full years he would not admit him into his presence. What has led most commentators to force the meaning here and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-39.htm">2 Samuel 13:39</a> is the passionate burst of grief when news was brought of Absalom's death following upon the anxious orders given to the generals to be careful of the young man's life. But David was a man of very warm affections, and while this would make him feel intense sorrow for the death of a son by his brother's hand, and stern indignation towards the murderer, there would still lie deep in the father's heart true love towards his sinning child, and Absalom's fall was sad enough to cause a strong revulsion of feeling. David's grief would be not merely for the death of his son, but that he should have died so miserably, and in an attempt so shameful. Was not, too, the natural grief of a father made the more deep by the feeling that this was the third stage of the penalty denounced on his own sin, and that the son's death was the result of the father's crime? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tekoah</span>. This town, famous as the birthplace of the Prophet Amos, lay upon the borders of the great wilderness southeast of Jerusalem. As it was only five miles to the south of Bethlehem, Joab's birthplace, he had probably often heard tales of this woman's intelligence; and, though he contrived the parable himself, yet it would need tact and adroitness on the woman's part to give the tale with tragic effect, and answer the king's questions with all the signs of genuine emotion. If her acting was bad, the king would see through the plot, and only by great skill would his heart be so moved as to three him to some such expression of feeling as would serve Joab's purpose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-3.htm">2 Samuel 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</div><div class="comm">

There is an interesting article in De Rossi, fixing with much probability the twelfth century as the date of this error. Though Absalom subsequently (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>) complained of the lax administration of justice in the realm, yet evidently this woman had the right of bringing her suit before the king; and we may be sure that Joab would take care that nothing unusual was done, lest it should awaken the king's suspicions. But possibly there was a want of method in judicial matters, and very much was left in the hands of the tribal officers, such as we find mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-5.htm">2 Samuel 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I <i>am</i> indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</div><div class="comm">

In ver. 15 she rightly calls them "the people." We have thus a glimpse of the ordinary method of administering the criminal law, and find that each portion of a tribe exercised justice within its own district, being summoned to a general convention by its hereditary chief; and in this case the widow represents it as determined to punish the crime of fratricide with inflexible severity, and we may assume that such was the usual practice. The mother sets before David the other side of the matter - her own loneliness, the wiping out of the father's house, the utter ruin of her home if the last live coal on her hearth be extinguished. And in this way she moves his generous sympathies even to the point of overriding the legal rights of the mishpachah. In modern communities there is always some formal power of softening or entirely remitting penalties required by the letter of the law, and of taking into consideration matters of equity and even of feeling, Which the judge must put aside; and in monarchies this is always the high prerogative of the crown. <span class="cmt_word">And we will destroy the heir also.</span> The Syriac has the third person, "And they will destroy even the heir, and quench my coal that is left." This is more natural, but there is greater pungency in the widow putting into the mouth of the heads of the clan, not words which they had actually spoken, but words which showed what would be the real effect of their determination. There is great force and beauty also in the description of her son as the last live coal left to keep the family hearth burning. In another but allied sense David is called "the lamp of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, marg.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-8.htm">2 Samuel 14:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.</div><div class="comm">

Less than this would not help Absalom's case. Instead, therefore, of  withdrawing, she represents herself as dissatisfied, and pleads for full forgiveness; and as this would be a violation of the letter of the Levitical Law, in order to remove David's supposed scruples, she takes upon herself the penalty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-10.htm">2 Samuel 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said, Whosoever saith <i>ought</i> unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-11.htm">2 Samuel 14:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.

Nothing short of this would serve Absalom, who already was so far forgiven as to be in no fear of actual punishment. It is remarkable that David does not hesitate finally to grant this without making further inquiry, though he must have known that a mother's pleas were not likely to be very impartial. Moreover, while in ver. 9 she had acknowledged that there might be a breach of the law in pardoning a murderer, she now appeals to the mercy of Jehovah, who had himself provided limits to the anger of the avenger of blood (see <a href="../../par/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>.). He had thus shown himself to be a God of equity, in whom mercy triumphed over the rigid enactments of law. The words which follow more exactly mean, "That the avenger of blood do not multiply destruction, and that they destroy not my son." Moved by this entreaty, the king grants her son full pardon, under the solemn guaranty of an oath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-12.htm">2 Samuel 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak <i>one</i> word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</div><div class="comm">

But now he is bound by the solemn oath he has taken to her to remit the penalty; for literally the words are, <span class="accented">and by the king's speaking this word he is as one guilty, unless he fetch home again his banished one.</span> She claims to have spoken in the name of all Israel, and very probably she really did express their feelings, as Absalom was very popular, and the people saw in Tamar's wrong a sufficient reason for, and vindication of, his crime. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">For we must needs die, and <i>are</i> as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect <i>any</i> person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither doth God,</span> etc. This translation is altogether wrong. What the woman says is, "God taketh not life [Hebrew, 'a soul'] away, but thinketh thoughts not to banish from him his banished one." Her argument is that death is the common lot, and that there is no way of bringing back the dead to life. But though death is thus a universal law, yet God does not kill. Death is not a penalty exacted as a punishment, but, on the contrary, he is merciful, and when a man has sinned, instead of putting him to death, he is ready to forgive and welcome back one rejected because of his wickedness. The application is plain. The king cannot restore Amnon to life, and neither must he kill the guilty Absalom, but must recall his banished son. The argument is full of poetry, and touching to the feelings, but is not very sound. For God requires repentance and change of heart; and there was no sign of contrition on Absalom's part. The power of the woman's appeal lay in what she says of God's nature. He is not intent on punishing, nor bent on carrying out the sentences of the Law in their stern literalness; but he is ready to forgive, and "deviseth devices" to bring home those now separate from him. There is also much that is worth pondering over in the distinction between death as a law of nature, and death as a penalty. The one is necessary, and often gentle and beneficial; but death as a penalty is stern and terrible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-15.htm">2 Samuel 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, <i>it is</i> because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore that I am come,</span> etc. The woman now professes to return to her old story as the reason for her importunity, but she repeats it in so eager and indirect a manner as to indicate that it had another meaning. Instead, too, of thanking the king for fully granting her petition, she still flatters and coaxes as one whose purpose was as yet ungained. The king's word is, <span class="cmt_word">for rest</span> (see margin): it puts an end to vexation, and, by deciding matters, sets the disputants at peace. He is as <span class="cmt_word">an angel of God,</span> as God's messenger, whose words have Divine authority; and his office is, not to <span class="cmt_word">discern</span>, but "to hear the good and the evil," unmoved, as the Vulgate renders it, by blessing and cursing. His mission is too high for him to be influenced either by good words or by evil, but having patiently heard both sides, and calmly thought over the reasons for and against, he will decide righteously. Finally, she ends with the prayer, <span class="cmt_word">And may Jehovah thy God be with thee!</span> By such words she hoped to propitiate the king, who now could not fail to see that the errand of the woman was personal to himself.

The king really was uncertain, and asked dubiously, whereas the Authorized Version admits only of an. affirmative answer. David had seen the general drift of the woman's meaning, but she had involved it in too much obscurity for him to do more than suspect that she was the mouthpiece of Joab, who was standing by, and whose face may have given signs of a more than ordinary interest in the woman's narrative. She now frankly acknowledges the truth, but skilfully interweaves much flattery in her answer. And  her words are far more expressive than what is given in our versions. Literally they are, <span class="accented">By thy life, O my lord the king, there is nothing on the right or on the left of all that my lord the king has spoken.</span> His words had gone straight to the mark, without the slightest deviation on either side.

For <span class="cmt_word">in the earth,</span> translate <span class="accented">in the land.</span> The Hebrew has no means of distinguishing the wider and narrower significations of the word; but while the king would be flattered by the supposition that he knew all that happened in his dominions, the assertion that he knew all that was done in all the world was too broad and general to be agreeable. The Authorized Version has been misled by the thought of what an angel might know; but while it was a compliment to ascribe to the king an angel's intelligence in his own sphere, it would have been bad taste and unmeaning to ascribe to him omniscience. Nay, it is an assumption without proof that even an angel knows "all things that are in the earth." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have done this thing.</span> This is an Oriental form of assent, just as we say in English, "It is done," that is, as good as done, now that the order is given. A few manuscripts, nevertheless, support a Mas-soretic emendation (K'ri), namely, "Thou hast done this: go therefore," etc. But both the Septuagint and Vulgate agree with the written text (K'tib), and it is less flat and commonplace than the supposed emendation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-22.htm">2 Samuel 14:22</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</span> Keil concludes from this that Joab had often interceded for Absalom's pardon, and that this had made the king suspect him of being the prime mover in the affair. But this is to force the meaning, Joab now stood confessed as the person who had brought the woman before the king, and had employed her to gain a hearing. Had he been allowed to plead freely, her intervention would not have been necessary. We have seen, too, that the king's suspicions have been made in the Authorized Version much stronger than they really were. Many commentators also assume that Joab had a friendship for Absalom, but there are few traces of it in his conduct, and more probably Joab was chiefly influenced by politic motives. It was injurious to the well being of the nation that there should be discord and enmity between the king and his eldest son, and that the latter should be living in exile. The K'ri, <span class="accented">thy <span class="cmt_word"></span>servant</span>, placed in the margin, is to be decidedly rejected, with all other attempts of the Massorites to remove little roughnesses of grammar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-23.htm">2 Samuel 14:23</a></div><div class="verse">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm">

It seems even as if Absalom was a prisoner in his house, as he could not leave it to visit Joab. Still, we must not assume that even kind treatment would have made Absalom a dutiful son, or weaned him from his ambitions purposes. The long plotted revenge, carried out so determinately, gives us a low idea of his character, and probably during these two years of waiting, he had brooded over David's criminal leniency, and regarded it as a justification for his own foul deed. And now, when allowed to come home, but still treated unkindly, thoughts condemnatory of his father's conduct were cherished by him. It seems, too, as if a protracted punishment is always dangerous to the moral character of the criminal. And must we not add another reason? Absalom, we may feel sure, saw with indignation the growing influence of Bathsheba over the king. A granddaughter of Ahithophel, she was sure to be an adept in those intrigues in which the women of a harem pass their time; and even if, upon the whole, we form a favourable judgment upon her character, yet undoubtedly she was a very able woman, and could have no affection for Absalom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a></div><div class="verse">But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</div><div class="comm">

But we cannot believe that the king's shekel was not full weight; for to imagine this is to suppose that the king had tampered with the coinage; for the shekel was a coin as well as a weight, being originally a fixed quantity of silver. As a matter of fact, David had amassed too much silver to have need of resorting to what is the expedient of feeble and impoverished princes. Nor can we grant an error in the number; for the versions all agree with the Hebrew, so that any mistake must, at all events, be of great antiquity. Josephus says that Solomon's body guard wore long hair powdered with gold dust, and undoubtedly Absalom's hair was something extraordinary (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>). But six pounds is so enormous a weight that it is just possible that some ancient copyist has enlarged the number, to make it accord with a legend current among the people, in which this feature of Absalom's beauty had been exaggerated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a></div><div class="verse">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name <i>was</i> Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three sons.</span> Their names are not given, because they died early (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>). Of his daughter <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, named after her aunt, and, like her, possessed of great beauty, the Septuagint adds that she became the  wife of Rehoboam, and mother of Abijah. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> we are told that Abijah's mother was "Maachah the daughter of Abishalom;" and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> that her name was "Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah." We thus gather that Tamar married Uriel, and that it was the granddaughter of Absalom who became Rehoboam's queen. It is strictly in accordance with Hebrew custom to call Absalom's granddaughter his daughter, and, as Uriel was a man of no political importance, he is passed over, as the narrator's object was to show that Abijah's mother was sprung from the handsome and notorious son of David (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20, 21</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-30.htm">2 Samuel 14:30</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, and set it on fire.</span> The Hebrew has, <span class="accented">Go, and I will set it on fire.</span> Absalom represents himself as doing in his own person what his servants were to be his instruments in accomplishing. The versions, however, agree with the Massorites in substituting the easy phrase in the text. But few languages are so indifferent to persons and numbers as the Hebrew. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-31.htm">2 Samuel 14:31</a></div><div class="verse">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto <i>his</i> house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Joab arose.</span> This high-handed proceeding forced Joab to pay the wished for visit. But, while we cannot acquit Absalom of petulance, we must not regard his act as one of angry revenge; had it been so, Joab would have openly resented it, and he was quite capable of making even the heir apparent feel his anger. It was probably intended as a rough practical joke, which taught Joab better manners, and which he must laugh at, though with inward displeasure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-32.htm">2 Samuel 14:32</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? <i>it had been</i> good for me <i>to have been</i> there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be <i>any</i> iniquity in me, let him kill me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If there be</span> (any) <span class="cmt_word">iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span> The word "any," wrongly inserted in the Authorized Version, as omitted in the Revised Version. It would have been monstrous for Absalom to profess innocence, with the murder of Amnon fresh in his memory; but the phrase, "if there be iniquity in me," means, "if my offence is still unpardoned." If year after year he was to be treated as a criminal, then he would rather be put to death at once. And Absalom's plea succeeds. Joab, who had been unwilling to visit the prisoner, now consents to act as mediator, reports to David his son's vexation at such long continued coldness, and obtains full pardon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-33.htm">2 Samuel 14:33</a></div><div class="verse">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king kissed Absalom.</span> The father's kiss was, as in the case of the prodigal son (<a href="../../par/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), the sign of perfect reconciliation, and of the restoration of Absalom to his place as a son, with all its privileges. But God's pardon was immediate (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>), while David's was unwilling, and wrung from him. The kiss, we may feel quite sure, was preceded by a conversation between David and his son, the record of which is omitted simply for the sake of brevity. Evidently it satisfied the king, and ended in the kiss which gave the son all he desired. But whatever may have been his professions, Absalom's subsequent conduct is proof that he still regarded Amnon's death as a just retribution for his conduct to Tamar, and secretly cherished a sullen anger against his father for not having punished the wrong doer himself. It was the contrast between his own five years of punishment and the mere verbal reproof which was all that Amnon had to suffer for his shameless conduct, which rankled in Absalom's mind, and gave him an excuse for finally plotting his father's ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
