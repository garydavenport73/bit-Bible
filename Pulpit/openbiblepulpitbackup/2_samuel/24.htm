<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a></div><div class="verse">For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which <i>was</i> with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the king said;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and the king said.</span> David's command was not the cause of Jehovah's auger, but the result of his having himself given way to ambition; and, as he yielded to the temptation, it so far became an act of Satan, in that it led to  sin; but in its final result it led to good, in that the chastisement cured the people of their thirst for war. And as Satan can act only so far as the Divine will permits, the temptation was most truly the doing of Jehovah (but see note on 1 Samuel 26:19). <span class="cmt_word">Captain of the host, which was with him.</span> There is a good deal of difficulty about this passage, as the word for "host" is not that elsewhere used, and the last phrase is somewhat meaningless. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a> we find "David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people." Without the concurrence of these rulers, who were the princes of the tribes, the census could not have been taken. But as the ancient versions confirm the reading of the Hebrew here, no change of the text is admissible. <span class="cmt_word">Number ye.</span> This is distinctly the war word, for which see note on 2 Samuel 18:1. It proves that the census was taken for military reasons. Even this in itself was not wrong (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>), but it is indicative of David's purpose. When, moreover, Moses numbered the people, the census was taken by the priests (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1, 2</a>), and from the payment of the half shekel to the sanctuary, it appears that it was to some extent a religious ceremony. All this David neglects, and the employment of Joab goes far to prove that what David wanted was an examination of the military resources of his kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see <i>it</i>: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</span> Joab was an unscrupulous and irreligious man; but he was clear headed, and far more statesmanlike than David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5-7</a>). He saw whither the king was drifting, and that the increase of the royal power, resulting from successful war, would be fatal to the liberties of Israel. Probably, too, though he had consented to carry out Uriah's murder, yet he despised David for it. When he had murdered Abner to avenge Asahel, David had deprived him of his command, and he had to endure a long period of disgrace; and now David uses him to murder one altogether innocent. Joab, we may feel sure, noted the degradation of David's character, and drew the conclusion that he was not the man to be trusted at the head of a military despotism. Warned thus by what he saw, his mind reverted to the principles of the theocracy, and their truth and value became more clear to his understanding; and honourably he remonstrates with David for violating them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4</a></div><div class="verse">Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The captains of the host.</span> The matter was not undertaken without a council being held, and at it David's chief officers agreed with Joab; but David had made up his mind, and would take no advice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a></div><div class="verse">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that <i>lieth</i> in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span>. There is some uncertainty as to the Aroer here meant. There is first a city of that name in the tribe of Gad facing Rabbah (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), and this is apparently the city meant; for it is said that "Joab and his men pitched in Aroer, on the south side of the city situated in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer." Now, Jazer is also in Gad, about seven miles west of Rabbah, and as Rabbah is on the extreme east of the Israelite territory towards Ammon, it would be a very convenient spot from which to commence the numbering, But there is another Aroer on the Arnon, to the south of Reuben, and many commentators think that this Aroer must be meant, as otherwise the tribe of Reuben would seem to have been omitted. But this Aroer is regularly called "Aroer on the brink of the valley of Arnon" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>); or simply Aroer "in the valley of Arnon" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>); and cannot possibly be "the city in the midst of the valley of Gad," nor can this Aroer be "toward Jazer." Really the difficulty is made by commentators whose idea of the method of the census is superficial. Joab, in commencing it, formed an encampment in the open country on the right-hand side, that is, on the south of Aroer in the tribe of Gad, as being central, with Reuben on the south, and Manasseh on the north. It was "toward Jazer," that is, it was on the Jazer side of Aroer, and not on the side opposite Rabbah. We, with our simpler way of describing the points of the compass, would merely say that Joab's camp was in the open pasture land southwest of Aroer. Joab probably selected this spot because, though on the eastern border, it was yet not too far from Jerusalem, was central, and because a brook from Jazer flowing eastward for some distance, and thence to the north past Rabbah, would supply his people with water; and from this camp he would direct the proceedings of those who were to take the census. And as probably there would be considerable opposition - for the people would see in an act which for four centuries had been in desuetude threats of heavier taxation, of heavier forced labour, and of longer service with the army - Joab would require the presence of a body of troops sufficiently powerful to overawe malcontents. And these would be of no use at Aroer on the Arnon, in the distant south, but must lie eneamped in some central position, whence detachments could rapidly be moved to any place where there was danger of resistance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-6.htm">2 Samuel 24:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they came to Gilead.</span> When the enumerators had finished their labours in Reuben and the region south of Aroer,  Joab moved his camp northwards, and pitched in Gilead, on the river Jabbek; and, having completed the counting in this part of the tribe of Gad, would next enter the wild regions of Manasseh. It is probable that the tribal princes and local officers actually numbered the people, and that Joab, with a powerful force, constrained them to obedience often against their will. It was possibly this danger of resistance which made David entrust the business to Joab, instead of employing the Levites. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Tahtim-hodshi</span>. Gesenius dismisses this name with the remark that it can scarcely be regarded as genuine. The versions give little help; but Thenius cleverly extracts from the LXX., "unto Bashan, which is Edrei." Others, by a slight change in the Hebrew, read, "the land of the Hittites," and suppose that Hodshi is a corruption of the Hebrew word for "month," so that the whole might have been, "They came to the land of the Hittites in the (third) month." Others, again, suppose that Hodshi is a corruption of the name of the town Kadesh. But the versions would certainly have preserved anything so commonplace as this. When they make mistakes, it is almost invariably in proper names or unusual phrases. The emendation of Thenius is too ingenious to be accepted, but it gives the right sense, namely, that from Gilead and the tribe of Gad the numerators went northward through Bashan and the rest of the half tribe of Manasseh till they came to Dan, the town on the extreme northeast border, and the limit in that direction of the Israelite realm, as Beersheba was its limit on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Dan-jaan.</span> Nowhere else is Dan found with this addition, and the Syriac omits it even here. The Vulgate, and Septuagint (Codex Alex.) read <span class="accented">Dan-jaar</span> the woodland Dan. Possibly the names of two towns have been run into one, and the original reading was "unto Dan and Ijon" (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>). Ijon was on the direct road from Dan to Sidon. <span class="cmt_word">Zidon</span>. This was on the extreme northwestern boundary. It did not actually belong to David, but both it and Tyro had apparently placed themselves under his protection, and were bound to render some kind of military service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a></div><div class="verse">And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, <i>even</i> to Beersheba.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tyre</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>). Tyre and the whole coast land between it and Sidon had been too strong for the tribe of Asher, and remained unsubdued. But, like the independent states in India, it acknowlodged the supremacy of the paramount power. <span class="cmt_word">The cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites.</span> It is evident from this that even in David's time there were towns and districts were Hivites and Canaanites dwelt as distinct communities, governed probably by their own laws. But as they were bound to serve in the Israelite armies, they were included in the census, and possibly one of its rosin objects was to learn the number of fighting men of alien races dwelling in Israel. They seem to have been reckoned as belonging to the tribe in whose borders they dwelt. So Baanah and Rechab, the murderers of Ishbosheth, though Beerothites (and therefore Gibeonites, who again were Hivites), were counted to Benjamin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>). These Gentile communities were chiefly to be found in the north, for which reason it was called "the circuit (<span class="accented">Gelil</span>) of the nations" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>), and in later times from <span class="accented">Gelil</span> came the name Galilee. The Syriac adds "Jebusites," and we find Jerusalem occupied by a community of Jebusites living in independence in the very neighbourhood of the warlike tribe of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). This numbering of the aborigines by David is referred to in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>, where it is added that Solomon made a separate census of them, and found that there were in Israel no fewer than a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred of these aliens. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8</a></div><div class="verse">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nine months and twenty days.</span> This long period seems excessive, if nothing more was intended than merely counting the heads of the people, especially as the census was left unfinished. But there might very probably be difficulties with the aliens dwelling in Israel; and it is still more probable that there was a complete examination of all the military resources of the land. The result showed a very different state of things from that described in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>, and we can well understand the existence of much elation and war lust among the Israelites on the first flush of pride in their new empire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah <i>were</i> five hundred thousand men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men</span>. In Chronicles the numbers are, "of Israel eleven hundred thousand men, and of Judah four hundred and sixty-five thousand men." These discrepancies are a remarkable confirmation of the truth of what is said in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a> that because of the outbreak of the Divine wrath, "the number was not put in the account of the Chronicles of King David." Neither the writer of the Books of Samuel nor of Chronicles had any official document to refer to; and as the numbers are lump sums, and derived probably from what was said by the enumerators, the more exact four hundred and sixty-five thousand men of the Chronicles might easily in round numbers be called a half million. The other is a much larger discrepancy, and no satisfactory explanation of it has been given. It  is, however, quite possible that the additional three hundred thousand men were made up of the thirty-eight thousand Levites, as numbered on a later occasion by David, of the Benjamites, and of the aborigines, who belonged to the northern part of the kingdom, and might be included among "all they of Israel" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>). The numbers are further attacked on the ground of exaggeration. A million and a half of fighting men means a general population of six or seven millions. Now, Palestine at most does not contain more than eleven thousand square miles, and a population of six millions means five hundred and forty-five persons to every square mile, or one to every acre. The country was undoubtedly very fertile in ancient times, and the ruins of populous cities are found where now there is a waste. But there were vast forests and pasture lands and downs, where there were the means of subsistence for only a few. But we must remember that the enumerators went as far north as Tyre, and counted the inhabitants, therefore, of the seaboard between it and Sidon. Probably they also acted in the same way in the south, where the limits of Simeon were very uncertain. Besides this, there is a very remarkable undesigned coincidence. We read in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>. that David had a force of two hundred and eighty-eight thousand men, who formed his regular army, and of whom twenty-four thousand were called up for training every month. But there are reasons for believing that David took for this purpose each fifth man of those of the military age (see Sime, 'Kingdom of All Israel,' p. 389); and thus the whole number of such men would be one million four hundred and forty thousand. This, as Mr. Sime has shown (ibid., p. 378), holds a middle place between the one million three hundred thousand of the Book of Samuel, and the one million five hundred and seventy thousand of Chronicles, and shows that these numbers are not to be rejected on the score of exaggeration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-10.htm">2 Samuel 24:10</a></div><div class="verse">And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.

It appears also that the displeasure of God was manifesting itself before David repented (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>). Some sign of this, either in public trouble, or in the brooding of the pestilential miasma over the land, brought home to David's mind the conviction of sin; and he at once humbled himself before God, for the vanity of mind which had engendered in him a wicked lust after martial glory and thirst for bloodshed. <span class="cmt_word">I have done very foolishly</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).

This is probably right as being in harmony with the rest. Three years of famine, three months of defeat, or three days of pestilence. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> famine, pestilence, and the sword are mentioned as three of God's four sore judgments. But a fourth judgment is there enumerated, namely, that of the increase of wild beasts, and Joshua the Stylite says that in Mesopotamia, as a result of the desolating war between the Romans and Persians, about A.D. , beasts of prey had become so numerous that they entered the villages and carried off the children from the streets, and were so bold and ferocious that even the men scarcely dared go about their labours in the fields (Jos. Styl., edit. Ur., chap. 85). <span class="cmt_word">Now advise, and see;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">now know, and see.</span> The phrase is common in the historical books (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-38.htm">1 Samuel 14:38</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-22.htm">1 Samuel 23:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-17.htm">1 Samuel 25:17</a>, etc.).

There would thus be nothing to come between the soul and God, and prevent the chastisement from having its due effect upon the heart. A famine would indeed equally come from God, but would necessitate effort and exertion on man's part. In the pestilence he would wait patiently, nor look to anything but prayer for averting God's judgment. In <a href="../../par/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a> David refers to God's mercies, in much the same way as here, as being a motive to repentance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a></div><div class="verse">So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even to the time appointed.</span> This rendering, though very uncertain, is retained in the Revised Version. It would mean, of course, the end of the third day, as the pestilence was to last for that time. The objections to it are that there is no article in the Hebrew, so that literally it would be "unto a time appointed." Secondly, the pestilence did not continue unto the time appointed, but was mercifully stayed. And thirdly, these words are a literal translation, indeed, of the Vulgate, but a violation of its  meaning. For Jerome, who made the translation, says, "'tempus constitutum' means the hour when the evening sacrifice was offered" ('Tradd. Hebrews in Duos Libres Regum'). The versions all agree that the pestilence lasted only a few hours. Thus the Syriac translates, "From morning until the sixth hour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> noon. So too the Septuagint, "From morning until the midday meal." The Vulgate adds on thrice hours, as the evening sacrifice was at the ninth hour; and this is the meaning of the Chaldee Paraphrase: "From the time the daily sacrifice was slain until it was burnt." As the word <span class="accented">moed</span> used here means both a time or place appointed for a meeting, and also the meeting itself, the right translation probably is, "From the morning even to the time of assembly," or, as we should say, "the hour of service." <span class="accented">Moed</span> was the regular word for the time of the temple service, derived from the old name of the tabernacle, which was called "the tent of <span class="accented">moed"</span> (see <a href="../../par/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>, etc.), rendered iu the Authorized Version, "the tabernacle of the congregation," and in the Revised Version, "the tent of meeting." The hour would thus be the ninth, or three o'clock in the afternoon. <span class="cmt_word">Seventy thousand men.</span> This is a vast number to fall victims of the pestilence in so short a time, as even the most dangerous forms of sickness take some days for their development. But similarly the army of Sennacherib was cut off in a night (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>); as were the firstborn in Egypt, whose visitation more nearly resembles the course of this pestilence; and the rapidity of the death blow, striking down so vast a multitude suddenly throughout all parts of the land, would be proof to every mind that the mortality was the Divine chastisement for national sin. It is possible, nevertheless, that the black death cloud, bringing with it the plague, may have been settling down upon the land previously, and have alarmed David, and brought him to repentance; and though no new cases occurred after the offering of his burnt offerings (ver. 25), yet it by no means follows that all cases of infection were miraculously cured. The malady may have run in them its normal course. It was Jerusalem that was saved from the blow, and, after the offering of the burnt offering, the pestilence smote down no more.

Looked at from above, from God's side, all things are foreknown and immutably fixed; looked at from man's side, all is perpetually changing as man changes. The rescue of Jerusalem as the result of David's penitence and prayers, is thus to human view a change in the counsels and even in the feelings of him who changeth not. <span class="cmt_word">The threshing place.</span> "The threshing floor," as rightly translated in vers. 18, 21, 24. Threshing floors were constructed, whenever possible, on eminences, that the wind might drive the chaff and dust away. Araunah's was on the east of Jerusalem, outside the walls, upon Mount Moriah, and was the site on which the temple was built (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Araunah</span>. The name is so spelt seven times in vers. 20-24, for which reason the Massorites have substituted it for <span class="accented">Avarnah</span>, found in this verse in the Hebrew text, and for <span class="accented">Aranyah</span> in ver. 18. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a> the name is spelt <span class="accented">Ornan</span>; in the Septuagint in all places, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, <span class="accented">Orna</span>, and in the Syriac, <span class="accented">Oron.</span> The name is, of course, a Jebusite word, and the variation arises from the narrators having written down the sound as it caught their ears. In this, as in many other particulars, it is clear that the chronicler derived his account from independent Sources. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a></div><div class="verse">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have done wickedly;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">I have done perversely</span>, or crookedly. David acknowledges that his conduct had not been upright and straightforward, but that he had turned aside into the paths of self-will and personal aggrandizement. <span class="cmt_word">These sheep, what have they done?</span> The sin had been quite as much that of the people as of the king; for the war lust had entered into the very heart of the nation. But David, with that warmth of feeling which makes his character so noble, can see only his own fault. It is not a true repentance when the sinner looks for excuses, and apportions the blame between himself and others. To David the people seemed innocent, or, if at all to blame, he felt that it was he who had set them the example and led them on. The narrative in this place is much briefer than in Chronicles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go up.</span> David probably, on receiving God's message, had gone to the tent which he had pitched for the ark in Zion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), in order that he might pray there; and while on his way he saw the dark plague cloud coming as the messenger of God's wrath to smite Jerusalem. In an agony of grief, he poured out his prayer that Jerusalem might be spared, and God heard him, and sent Gad a second time to bid him offer sacrifice, that, by making an  atonement, he might stand between the dead and the living, as Aaron had done in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>) He is therefore to leave the tabernacle, and mount up to the summit on which Araunah's threshing floor was situated. We read in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-28.htm">1 Chronicles 21:28-30</a> that David wished to go to Gibeon, where the Mosaic tabernacle and altar of burnt offering were, to inquire of God, but that he was afraid, as the angel of the pestilence was smiting outside the walls. This is mentioned as an excuse for his offering at an unconsecrated spot. But it also suggests that David's choice was a submission to a chastisement already at work.

The addition there of the story of Araunah's four sons hiding themselves is very lifelike and natural. For these remnants of the aborigines, though tolerated, yet held a very insecure position, as we have seen in the dealings of Saul with the Gibeonites; and the coming of the king with his retinue to the out of the way spot where Araunah was at work, no doubt filled them all with terror. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-21.htm">2 Samuel 24:21</a></div><div class="verse">And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a></div><div class="verse">And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what <i>seemeth</i> good unto him: behold, <i>here be</i> oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and <i>other</i> instruments of the oxen for wood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>, here be <span class="cmt_word">oxen</span>. Araunah was threshing out his wheat by dragging sledges or frames of wood without wheels over it. All these he at once gives to David, that the sacrifice may be offered without delay, as it would have cost much time and labour to bring wood up from the city. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">and other instruments of the oxen,</span> the Hebrew has "the harness or furniture of the oxen," all of which was of wood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-23.htm">2 Samuel 24:23</a></div><div class="verse">All these <i>things</i> did Araunah, <i>as</i> a king, give unto the king.

It is, of course, possible (though highly is probable) that Araunah was the representative of the kings of Jebus, and a titular monarch, like the Maori king in New Zealand. But the word is omitted in the Septuagint and Syriac, and is probably a mere repetition of the following word. The remark is made in order to point out Araunah's generosity; and to mark even more clearly how hearty and sincere he was in his offering, the narrator adds, in Araunah's own words, his prayer for God's acceptance of David and his offering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy <i>it</i> of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span> In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-25.htm">1 Chronicles 21:25</a>, "So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight." There is a superficial, but no real discrepancy between these two narratives. David gave the fifty shekels for the immediate use of the place, and for the oxen and implements. He had no idea at the time of permanently occupying it, and probably the note in the LXX., interpolated by scribes from the margin into the text, is true, "And Solomon added to the altar afterwards, for it was small at the first." It was a small altar hurriedly put together for the purpose of offering one sacrifice; and fifty shekels would be full compensation. But the sacrifice had hallowed the spot, and, when finally it was selected as the site for the temple, David bought the whole area and all that Araunah possessed there. Fifty shekels of silver would be about &pound;9; six hundred shekels of gold would be about &pound;1500; so that there is no comparison between the two sums. But the precious metals were worth very much more in David's time than in ours, so that the smaller sum was adequate compensation for David's first acquisition, while the larger implies the purchase of an extensive and valuable estate. Substantially the fuller narrative in Chronicles agrees with this. David refuses to sacrifice of that which cost him nothing, and must therefore have at once paid for what he took. But When God accepted his offering, and answered him by fire from heaven, then David said, "This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel." And as the Chronicler has in view throughout the selection of the site for the temple, he naturally mentions its full cost. In the Book of Samuel this purpose is not expressly mentioned, and the narrative closes with the forgiveness of the sin both of David and his people. Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed. But this sudden smiting down of so large a host humbled both king and people, and their eagerness for war and their lust of empire ceased. ?
