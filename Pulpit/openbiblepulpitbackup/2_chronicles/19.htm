Compare the use of the phrase in vers. 16 and 26, 27 of last chapter. The only peace in which it could be reasonably supposed Jehoshaphat returned to his house and the metropolis was that of freedom from war, and of present "assurance of his life." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore <i>is</i> wrath upon thee from before the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him</span>. For Hanani, the faithful father of a faithful son, see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>, where we read that he "came to Asa King of Judah," etc. Also for Jehu, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>, where we read of his commission at the word of the Lord to rebuke Baasha the King of Israel, at a date upwards of thirty years before the present; and see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-34.htm">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>, which would lead us to infer, though not with certainty, that he outlived Jehoshaphat. The book called by his name, however, was not necessarily finished by him. It is evident that neither the word of the Lord nor the messengers and prophets of the Lord were bound by the orthodox limits of the divided kingdom. The powerful character and the moral force of the true prophet is again seen (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1-8</a>) in the way in which he was wont to <span class="accented">go</span> <span class="accented">out to meet</span> the evil-doer, though he were a king. We are accustomed to set the whole of this down to the account of the special inspiration of the prophet of old; yet <span class="accented">that</span> was but typical of the intrinsic force that truth faithfully spoken should wield in its own right in later times. Religion is <span class="accented">established</span> in the nation and people that know and do this, by the accredited teachers of it, vie. the plain rebuke of the wrong. <span class="cmt_word">Shouldest thou...  love them that hate the Lord</span>? Strong suspicion must attend upon Jehoshaphat, that he had been not a little misled by answering to some personal fascination in Ahab. The prophet's rebuke is not that Jehoshaphat helped both Israel and therein Judah also against a common foe, but that he helped the ungodly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore wrath upon thee</span>, etc. The significance of this sentence was probably not merely retrospective, glancing at the fact that Jehoshaphat returned to Jerusalem <span class="accented">minus</span> the victory for which he had bid, but was probably an intimation of troubles that should ripen, were already ripening for Jehoshaphat, in the coming invasion of his own kingdom (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Nevertheless; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> one of the few particles that were <span class="accented">affirmative</span> in the earlier Hebrew (<a href="../../par/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>), but <span class="accented">adversative in the</span> later (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7, 21</a>). It may be well rendered, "on the other hand." The expression here recalls the less favourable "notwithstanding" of <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">There are good things found in thee</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-1.htm">2 Chronicles 17:1-9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Beershsba to Mount Ephraim</span>. The length of the good land is not to be quoted, as of old, the undivided "Dan to Beersheba," but Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-16.htm">2 Chronicles 13:16-19</a>). Jehoshaphat makes another conscientious and vigorous endeavour to reform his own kingdom, to keep it steadfast in the worship of God, and free from idolatry. It is to be noticed that he does not turn away his ear from the rebuke which had been given him, but turns his heart to it. As it does not appear that he broke with Israel and Israel's kings (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7, 14, 24</a>), it is possible, especially in view of ver. 37 in our ch. 20, that the severity of the Divine rebuke was understood to apply to the occasions which found Jehoshaphat in alliance with a king notably bad, and for some supposed chance of advantage to himself. This last element of consideration will difference sufficiently the two cases just cited, to wit, the case in which Jehoshaphat joined himself with Azariah, and is sternly "prophesied against," and that in which he helped Jehoram, and through Elisha's intervention gained him the day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judges...  fenced cities</span>. Jehoshaphat proceeds from direct religious reforms to that which is of importance only second in the life of a nation - reform in the matter of civil administration of justice. The skeleton here given of what should be the character of a <span class="accented">judge</span>, and why, harmonizes well with the uniform stress laid in Scripture upon "justice and judgment." It is hard indeed to see, rather impossible, upon what foundation a sure structure of civil growth and stability can be laid, except on that of positive religion. Note the positions and the succinct arguments of vers. 6, 7; and how unequivocally they are based upon faith in a personal God, and upon his revealed character. It can scarcely be that this was the first time of judges being set in the cities of Judah but possibly the meaning intended to be conveyed with emphasis is, that now, looking well round his kingdom, he took care that all the cities should be properly provided with the necessary judges, while of late some had been, and some had not, and some, though they had been officered with judges, had found them not what judges ought to be. The immense majority of the "six thousand" Levite "officers and judges" of David's regulation (1 Chronicles 23:4; 36:29) had, with their superiors, kings and prophets, gone astray. With our present passage may be compared <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where the original enactment of judges and officers is narrated. <span class="accented">Fenced cities</span>. Hebrew for "fenced," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>; kal passive part. plur. The word occurs twenty-six times from the Book of Numbers to the Book of the Prophet Zechariah, and is rendered in the Authorized Version "fenced" or "defenced" twenty-two times, "walled" twice, "strong" once, and "mighty" once. The "gates" of the original institution in Deuteronomy are now (probably still the gates of) <span class="accented">fenced cities.</span>

It has been proposed to remove this clause so as to begin the next verse with it (and so the Revised Version shows as a clause by itself, "And they returned to Jerusalem"), and, to make this fit the better, the word <span class="accented">did</span> in the first line of the verse is changed into "had." It is, however, possible to render the clause, "And they dwelt in Jerusalem,' which would make a far mere coherent sense, and would mark the permanence and stationariness of this chief court.
