The expression," the Name of the Lord," is of very early date (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>). A name named upon a person at the first purported as far as possible to mark his <span class="accented">nature</span>, either its <span class="accented">tout ensemble</span> or some striking attribute of it.

The Septuagint write the name <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Hiram.</span> The name of Hiram's father was Abibaal. Hiram himself began to reign, according to Menander, when nineteen years of age, reigned thirty-four years (B.C. 1023-990), and died therefore at the age of fifty-three. Of Hiram and his reign in Tyre very little is known beyond what is so familiar to us from the Bible history of David and Solomon. The city of Tyre is among the most ancient. Though it is not mentioned in Homer, yet the Sidonians, who lived in such close connection with the Tyrians, are mentioned there ('Iliad.,' 6:290; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:84; 22:424), whilst Virgil calls Tyre the Sidonian city, Sidon being twenty miles distant ('AEn.,' 1:12, 677; 4:545). The modern name of Tyre is <span class="accented">Sur.</span> The city was situate on the east coast of the Mediterranean, in Phoenicia, about seventy-four geographical miles north of Joppa, while the road distance from Joppa to Jerusalem was thirty-two miles. The first Bible mention of Tyre is in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>. After that the more characteristic mentions of it are <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, with all its parallels; 2 Samuel 24:7; <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-2.htm">Ezekiel 26:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-1.htm">Ezekiel 27:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-2.htm">Zechariah 9:2, 3</a>. Tyre was celebrated for its working in copper and brass, and by no means only for its cedar and timber felling. The good terms and intimacy subsisting between Solomon and the King of Tyre speak themselves very plainly in Bible history, without leaving us dependent on doubtful history, or tales of such as Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:05. &sect; 3; 'Contra Apion,' 1:17). For the timber, metals, workmen, given by Hiram to Solomon, Solomon gave to Hiram corn and oil, ceded to him some cities, and the use of some ports on the Red Sea (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14, 25-28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21-23</a>.

This sweet incense, compounded of the four ingredients stacte, onycha, galbanum, pure frankincense, was to be burnt morning and evening, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifices on the altar made of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, which stood in the holy place facing the ark. with the table of shewbread on the one hand, and the golden candlestick on the other. While the act of atonement was set forth by the offering of the victim on the brazen altar in the outer court, the ascending, acceptable, and accepted prayer and aspiration of the congregation were expressed by the sweet incense-burning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The continual</span> <span class="cmt_word">shew-bread</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>). The elementary meaning of the word here rendered "shewbread" is "a ranging in order," whether the "order" might be, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of an army in battle array (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-16.htm">1 Samuel 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-8.htm">1 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>), or of the lamps of the holy candlestick (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-37.htm">Exodus 39:37</a>), or of pilings of wood to be burnt on the altar (<a href="../../par/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), or of cakes of bread, as presumably 'here and in some parallel passages (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>). For the table which was to carry these cakes, see <a href="../../par/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>; the last verse of the former passage speaking of the shewbread under the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. (For the position of the table, see <a href="../../par/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>.) The word employed in the text is first used to express the piles of cakes, called in our Authorized Version shewbread in <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6, 7</a>; then <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-29.htm">1 Chronicles 23:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a>; as also again in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>; and in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-33.htm">Nehemiah 10:33</a>. Where in these passages the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> is not expressed, that it is understood may be gathered from the other passages (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>). The bread consisted of twelve large cakes of unleavened dough (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>), ranged in two heaps, and with a golden cup of frankincense (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>) to each pile. When on every seventh day new cakes were substituted, the old ones belonged to the priests (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33, 34</a>). The twelve cakes pointed to the twelve tribes. Their size may be judged from the statement that each cake contained two tenth deals, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two-tenths of an ephah, equal to about six pounds and a quarter. The exact significance of this bread is not stated in Scripture. Part of it lay plainly in the twelve cakes, part, perhaps, in their becoming priest's food, found by the people (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>), after having been presented seven days before the Lord. Much that is interesting but not finally satisfactory on the question may be found in the article "Shewbread" in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1271. Our Authorized Version "shewbread' comes from Luther's <span class="accented">Schaubrode.</span> Wickliffe, after the Vulgate <span class="accented">panes propositionis</span>, designates it "the loaves of proposition." The New Testament has, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; as also in the Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-4.htm">Luke 6:4</a>); while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>).

The morning and evening offering were alike, viz. a lamb, a meal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of flour, mixed with the fourth part of a bin of beaten oil, and a drink offering consisting of the fourth part of a bin of "wine," or of "strong drink." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The burnt offering <span class="cmt_word">on the sabbath</span>.

To find a place for <span class="accented">this</span> subject amid his careful selection, and rejection in many cases, of the matter at his command, is certainly a decision in harmony with his general design in this work. Then, again, they may be remarked on as spoken to another king, who, whether it were to be expected or no, was, it is plain, a sympathizing hearer of the piety and religious resolution of Solomon (ver. 12). This is one of the touches of history that does not diminish our regret that we do not know more of Hiram. He was no "proselyte," but he had the sympathy of a convert to the religion of the Jew. Perhaps the simplest and most natural explanation may just be the truest, that Hiram for some long time had seen "the rising" kingdom, and alike in David and Solomon in turn, "the coming" men. He had been more calmly and deliberately impressed than the Queen of Sheba afterwards, but not less effectually and operatively impressed. And once more the passage is noteworthy for the utterances of Solomon in themselves. As parenthetically testifying to a powerful man, who could be a powerful helper of Solomon's enterprise, his outburst of explanation, and of ardent religious purpose, and of humble godly awe, is natural. But that he should call the temple he purposed to build "so great," as we cannot put it down either to intentional exaggeration or to sober historic fact, must the rather be honestly set down to such considerations as these, viz. that in point of fact, neither David nor Solomon were "travelled men," as Joseph and Moses, for instance. Their measures of greatness were largely dependent upon the existing material and furnishing of their own little country. And further, Solomon speaks of the temple as great very probably from the point of view of its simple religious uses (note end of ver. 6) as the place of sacrifice in especial rather than as a place, for instance, of vast congregations and vast processions. Then, too, as compared with the tabernacle, it would loom "great," whether for size or for its enduring material. Meantime, though Solomon does indeed use the words (ver. 5)," The house.., is great," yet, throwing on the words the light of the remaining clause of the verse, and of David's words in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, it is not very certain that the main thing present to his mind was <span class="accented">not</span> the size, but rather the <span class="accented">character</span> of the house, and the solemn character of the <span class="accented">enterprise</span> itself (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-18.htm">2 Chronicles 6:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who am I...  save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span> The drift of Solomon's thought is plain - that nothing would justify mortal man, if he purported to build really a palace of residence for him whom the heaven of heavens could not contain, but that he is justified all the more in "not giving sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he had found out a place" (<a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4, 5</a>) where man might acceptably, in God's <span class="accented">appointed way</span>, draw near to him. If "earth draw near to heaven," it may be confidently depended on that heaven will not be slow to bend down its glory, majesty, grace, to earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who <i>am</i> I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?</div><div class="comm">

By comparison of ver. 3, it appears that Solomon makes of Hiram's services to David his father a very plea why his own requests addressed now to Hiram should be granted. If we may be guided by the <span class="accented">form</span> of the expressions used in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11, 12</a>, Hiram had in the first instance volunteered help to David, and had not waited to be applied to by David. This would show us more clearly the force of Solomon's plea. Further, if we note the language of <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>, we may be disposed to think that it fills a gap in our present connection, and indicates that, though Solomon appears here to have had to take the initiative, an easy opportunity was opened, in the courteous embassy sent him in the persons of Hiram's "servants." That the king of this most privileged, separate, and exclusive people of Israel (and <span class="accented">he</span> the one who conducted that people to the very zenith of their fame) should have to apply and be permitted to apply to foreign and, so to say, heathen help, in so intrinsic a matter as the finding of the "cunning" and the "skill" of head and hand for the most sacred and distinctive <span class="accented">chef d'oeuvre</span> of the said exclusive nation, is a grand instance of nature breaking all trammels, even when most divinely purposed, and a grand token of the dawning comity of nations, of free-trade under the unlikeliest auspices, and of the brotherhood of humanity, never more broadly illustrated than when on an international scale. The competence of the Phoenicians and the people of Sidon and those over whom Hiram immediately reigned in the working of the metals, and furthermore in a very wide range of other subjects, is well sustained by the allusions of very various authorities (already instanced under 1 Chronicles 14:1, and <span class="accented">passim</span>; Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:289-294; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:614; 15:415-426; Herod., 3:19; 7:23, 44, 96; Strabo, 16:2. &sect; 23). The man who was sent is described in vers. 13, 14, <span class="accented">infra</span>, as also <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Purple, ... crimson, ... blue</span>. It is not absolutely necessary to suppose that the same Hiram, so skilled in working of gold, silver, brass, and iron, was <span class="accented">the</span> authority sent for these matters of various coloured dyes for the cloths that would later on be required for curtains and other similar purposes in the temple. So far, indeed, as the literal construction of the words go, this would seem to be what is meant, and no doubt <span class="accented">may</span> have been the case, though unlikely. The <span class="accented">purple</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). A Chaldee form of this word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) occurs three times in <a href="../../par/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 16, 29</a>, and appears in each of those cases in our Authorized Version as "scarlet." Neither of these words is the word used in the numerous passages of Exodus, Numbers, Judges, Esther, Proverbs, Canticles, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, nor, indeed, in ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. In all these places, numbering nearly forty, the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. The purple was probably obtained from some shell-fish on the coast of the Mediterranean. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). Gesenius says that this was a colour obtained from multitudinous insects that tenanted one kind of the flex (<span class="accented">Coccus ilicis</span>), and that the word is from the Persian language. The Persian <span class="accented">kerm</span>, Sanscrit <span class="accented">krimi</span>, Armenian <span class="accented">karmir</span>, German <span class="accented">carmesin</span>, and our own "crimson," keep the same framework of letters or sound to a remarkable degree. This word is found only here, ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>, and the <span class="accented">scarlet</span> of some forty places in the Pentateuch and other books, come as the rendering of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The <span class="accented">blue</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>). This is the same word as is used in some fifty other passages in Exodus, Numbers, and in later books. This colour was obtained from a shell-fish (<span class="accented">Helix ianthina</span>) found in the Mediterranean, the shell of which was blue. <span class="cmt_word">Can skill to grave</span>. The word "to grave" is the piel conjugation of the very familiar Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, "to open." Out of twenty-nine times that the verb occurs in some part of the piel conjugation, it is translated "grave" nine times, "loosed" eleven times, "put off" twice, "ungirded" once, "opened" four times, "appear" once, and "go free" once. Perhaps the "opening" the ground with the plough (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24</a>) leads most easily on to the idea of "engraving." <span class="cmt_word">Cunning men whom...

If they were accessible in Lebanon, it is not on the face of it to be supposed they would be ordered from such a distance as Ophir. Lastly, there is very great difference of opinion as to what the tree was in itself. In Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. 3. appendix, p. 6, the subject is discussed more fully than it can be here, and with some of its scientific technicalities. Celsius has mentioned fifteen woods for which the honour has been claimed. More modern disputants have suggested five, of these the red sandalwood being considered, perhaps, the likeliest. So great an authority as Dr. Hooker pronounces that it is a question quite undetermined. But inasmuch as it is so undetermined, it would seem possible that, if it were a precious wood of the smaller kind (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ebony with us), and, so to say, of shy growth in Lebanon, it might be that it did grow in Lebanon, but that a very insufficient supply of it there was customarily supplemented by the imports received from Ophir. Or, again, it may be that the words, "out of Lebanon," are simply misplaced (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a>), and should follow the words, "fir trees." The rendering "pillars" in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a> for "rails" or "props" is unfortunate, as the other quoted uses of the wood for "harps" and "psalteries" would all betoken a <span class="accented">small</span> as well as very hard wood. Lastly, it is a suggestion of Canon Rawlinson that, inasmuch as the almug wood of Ophir came <span class="accented">via</span> Phoenicia and Hiram, Solomon may very possibly have been ignorant that "Lebanon" was not its proper <span class="accented">habitat. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy servants can skill to cut timber</span>. This same testimony is expressed yet more strongly in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, "There is not any among us that can skill to hew timber like the Sidoniaus." Passages like <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, go to show that the verb employed in our text is rightly rendered "hew," as referring to the <span class="accented">felling</span> rather than to any subsequent dressing and sawing up of the timber. It is, therefore, rather more a point of interest to learn in <span class="accented">what</span> the great skill consisted which so threw Israelites into the shade, while distinguishing Hiram's servants. It is, of course<span class="cmt_word">,</span> quite possible that the "hewing," or "felling," may be taken to <span class="accented">infer</span> all the subsequent cutting, dressing, etc. Perhaps the skill intended will have included the best selection of trees, as well as the neatest and quickest laying of them prostrate, and if beyond this it included the sawing and dressing and shaping of the wood, the room for superiority of skill would be ample. <span class="cmt_word">My servants</span> (so vers. 2, 18; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>).

The former Hebrew word is that constantly employed for "plagues," "strokes," etc., and it is nowhere but in this place rendered "beaten." <span class="cmt_word">I will give to thy servants</span>. This passage is hard to reconcile with what is said in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>; but meantime it is not certain that it needs to be reconciled with it. It is possible that the two passages are distinct. The contents of the present verse, at all events, need not be credited with any ambiguity, unless, indeed, we would wish it more definite, whether the expression, "I will give <span class="accented">to</span> thy servants," may not be quite as correctly understood, "<span class="accented">for</span> thy servants," <span class="accented">i.e. to thee as</span> the hire of them. If this be so, it would enable us to give at once <span class="accented">all the wheat</span>, and <span class="accented">two hundred</span> out of the 20,000 baths of oil, for the consumption, not of the literal workmen, but of the royal household. Then this granted, the verse, though not identical with <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>, is brought into harmony with it. Reverting to the statement in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>, what we learn is that Solomon, in his application to Hiram, offers payment for the hire of his servants such as he shall appoint (ver. 6). Hiram's reply is that he shall be satisfied to receive as payment "food <span class="accented">for his household"</span> (ver. 9), the amount of it and the annual payment of it being specified in ver. 11. This is the whole case, the discrepancies in which are plain, but they do not amount to contradictions. The appearance that is worn on the face of things is that the writer in Chronicles gives what came to be the final arrangement as to remuneration, though confessedly it is placed as much as the account in Kings in the draft of Solomon's original application to Hiram. <span class="cmt_word">Measures</span>. These were cots, and the cot was the same as the homer. From a calculation of some doubtfulness, however, made under the suggestions of <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22</a>, it has been said that the consumption of the royal household of <span class="accented">Solomon</span> was above 32,000 measures. The cor, or homer, was the largest of the five dry measures of capacity, being equal to 180 <span class="accented">cabs</span>, 100 <span class="accented">omers</span>, 30 <span class="accented">seahe</span>, 10 <span class="accented">ephahs</span> (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3.1741), though what was the exact value of any one of these in modern measures has only been uncertainly and very approximately arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Baths</span>. The bath was the largest of the three liquid measures of capacity, being equal to 6 <span class="accented">bins</span> and 72 <span class="accented">logs</span> (see same 'Dictionary,' 3:1740).

In the parallel of Kings an identical expression is used for the communications of both: "Solomon sent to Hiram" (ver. 2), and "Hiram sent to Solomon" (ver. 8). The productions of the forms of this correspondence by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:2)and Eupolemus ('Ap. Praep. Evang.,' 9:33) are, of course, merely mythical. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord hath loved his people.</span> This beautiful expression has parallels, not only in such passages as <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; but in such as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-12.htm">Psalm 115:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 4</a>. These were all precursors of the fuller assertion and kinder demonstration of God's love repeated so often and in such tender connections in the Epistles of the New Testament. This verse and the following are also testimony to the indirect influences on surrounding nations of the knowledge of the one true Creator-God and Ruler-God, that was domiciled by special revelation and oracle (<a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>) with Israel. Where nations near were bitter foes, they often feared Israel's God, whereas now they were friends they could summon to their lips the highest of the outbursts of praise, not to say of adoration. The very noteworthy sympathy of Hiram with Israel may have owed something to his personal predilection for David (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>). And <span class="accented">this</span> again is convincing testimony to the worth and usefulness of individual character which here influenced the destiny of two whole nations.

But the following word translated "my father" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is less easily explained; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16</a> ("<span class="accented">his</span> father") is quite sufficient to negative the rendering" father" altogether. In our text altogether inappropriate, it may be called there altogether impossible. It has been proposed to render it as a proper name <span class="accented">Abi</span>, or as an affix of honour, <span class="accented">Ab</span>, equal to "master." However, Gesenius (in '<span class="accented">Lexicon</span>,' <span class="accented">sub roe.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span> (6), which see) furnishes a signification, "chief counsellor," which (taking it to mean chief counsellor, or as it were expert, chief referee, or even only <span class="accented">foreman</span> in such matters as might be in question) would well suit all the passages, and remove all difficulty.

But the parallel gives the mother as a woman "of the tribe of Naphtali," and calls her a "widow." This must mean, either that she was a widow <span class="accented">now</span>, or that she was a widow when "the man of Tyre" married her. If this latter is the correct meaning, it has been suggested that, though the mother was really a woman of the daughters of Dan, yet the husband who, dying, left her a widow, was of the tribe of Naphtali, and that from this <span class="accented">she</span> became credited with belonging to that tribe. It would seem not altogether impossible that it may be intended to state, in a delicate way, that this remarkably able man was the natural son of the widow in question, "the man of Tyre" (not called <span class="accented">her husband</span>) being the father.

The explanation probably is that of the 3600 "stranger" overseers, the small proportion of 300 were of much higher grade in office than the rest, and were ranked by the writer in Kings with those overseers (250) of Solomon, who were probably Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_chronicles/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Chronicles 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
