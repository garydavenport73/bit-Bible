THE APOSTLE'S CONCERN FOR THE COLOSSI. AN CHURCH. So far the contents of the letter have been of a general and preparatory character. New the writer begins to indicate the special purpose he has in view by declaring, in connection with his concern for the welfare of the Gentile Churches at large (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24-29</a>), <span class="accented">the deep anxiety which he at present feels respecting the Colossian and neighbouring Churches.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I would have you know how great a strife I have on behalf of you and those in Laodicea</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9-13</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8, 25-30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-20.htm">Galatians 4:20</a>). The apostle has dwelt at such length and so earnestly upon his own position and responsibilities (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24-29</a>), that the Colossians may feel how real and strong is his interest in their welfare, though personally strangers to him (see next clause). His solicitude for them is in keeping with the toil and strife of his whole ministry. "I would have you know;" a familiar Pauline phrase (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("how great') has, perhaps, a slightly exclamatory force, as in <a href="../../par/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5</a> (only other instance of the word in the New Testament), and in classical Greek. For "strife," see note on "striving" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>): the energy and abruptness of language characterizing this second chapter bear witness in the inward wrestling which the Colossian difficulty occasioned in the apostle's mind. (On the close connection of Colossae with Laodicea, comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13-17</a>, notes; also Introduction, &sect; 1.) The danger which had come to a head in Colassae was doubtless threatening its neighbours. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and as many as have not seen my face in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (ver. 5; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>), raise the question whether St. Paul had ever visited Colossae. The language of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see note) raises a strong presumption against his being the founder of this Church, and the narrative of the Acts scarcely admits of any visit to this region in former missionary journeys. Theodoret amongst the Greeks, followed by our own Lardner and a few recent critics, contended that the apostle distinguishes here between Colossians and Laodiceans (or at least the former), and <span class="accented">those who had not seen His face.</span> But the disjunction is grammatically harsh and improbable (see Ellicott). (On the general question, see Introduction, &sect; 2.) The apostle is the more anxious for this endangered Church, as the gifts that his presence might have conveyed (<a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>) were wanting to them. He says, "in flesh," for "in spirit" he is closely united with them (ver. 5; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>).

The <span class="accented">heart</span>, in Biblical language, is not the seat of feeling only, but stands for the whole inner man, as the "vital centre" of his personality (see Back's 'Biblical Psychology:' comp. <a href="../../par/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">While they are</span> (literally, <span class="accented">they having been</span>) <span class="cmt_word">drawn together in love, and into all</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">riches of the full assurance of the understanding, unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">into</span>) (full) <span class="cmt_word">knowledge of the mystery of God,</span> (even) <span class="cmt_word">Christ</span> (ver. 19; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2, 3, 15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>). In the best Greek copies "drawn together" is nominative masculine, agreeing with "they," the logical subject implied in "their <span class="accented">hearts"</span> (feminine). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> has the same sense in ver. 19 and <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> it is quoted from the LXX in another sense; and it has a variety of meanings in the Acts. "Drawn together" expresses the double sense which accrues to the verb in combination with the two prepositions "in" and "into:" "united <span class="accented">in</span> love," Christians are prepared to be "led <span class="accented">into</span> all the wealth of Divine knowledge." This combination of "love and knowledge" appears in all St. Paul's letters of this period (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; and contrast <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 8-13</a>). "The riches of the full assurance," etc., and "the knowledge of the mystery" are the counterpart of "the riches of the glory of the mystery," of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; the fulness of conviction and completeness of knowledge attainable by the Christian correspond to the full and satisfying character of the revelation he receives in Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-19</a>). (On "understanding," see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>.) "Full assurance," or "conviction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is a word belonging to St. Luke and St. Paul (with the Epistle to the Hebrews) in the New Testament (not found in classical Greek), and denotes radically "a bringing to fall measure or maturity." Combined with "understanding," it denotes the ripe, intelligent persuasion of one who enters into the whole wealth of the "truth as it is in Jesus" (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>, R.V.; also <a href="../../par/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> and Romans 14:5, for corresponding verb). In this inward "assurance," as in a fortress, the Colossians were to entrench themselves against the attacks of error (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>, and notes). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is either in explanatory apposition to the previous clause, or rather donors the <span class="accented">further purpose</span> for which this wealth of conviction is to be sought: "knowledge of the Divine mystery, knowledge of Christ"  - this is the supreme end, ever leading on and upward, for the pursuit of which all strengthening of heart and understanding are given (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The Revisers have corrected the erroneous "acknowledgment" by their paraphrastic rendering, "that they may know." (On <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 3), see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>.) The object of this knowledge is the great <span class="accented">manifested mystery</span> of God, namely <span class="accented">Christ</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). We confidently accept here the Revised reading, that of nearly all recent textual critics, which omits the words found in the Received Text between "God" and "Christ." There are extant eleven distinct variations of this reading, and that of the Textus Receptus is, to all appearance, the latest and worst; "the passage is altogether an instructive lesson on textual criticism" (Lightfoot, pp. 252, 253; also Westcott and Hort, 'Introduction: Notes on Selected Readings,' pp. 125, 126). The words thus read have been interpreted mystery of the God Christ" (the Latin Hilary, and a few moderns); of the God of Christ" (Meyer, quoting <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>); - both interpretations grammatically correct, but unsuitable here, even if in harmony with Pauline usage elsewhere. Alford omits "of Christ" altogether, distrusting the textual evidence. Meyer objects to the rendering we have followed (that of Ellicott, Lightfoot, Revisers), that the apostle, if this be his meaning, has expressed himself ambiguously; but comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a> (see note); also <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, "The mystery, <span class="accented">who was</span> manifested in flesh."

Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and others make the relative pronoun neuter, referring to "mystery;" but "Christ," the nearer antecedent, is preferable (vers. 9, 10; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16, 17, 19</a>). <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">him</span> the apostle finds what false teachers sought elsewhere, a satisfaction for the intellect as well as for the heart - <span class="accented">treasures of wisdom and knowledge</span> to enrich the understanding, and unsearchable mysteries to exercise the speculative reason. "Hidden" is, therefore, a secondary predicate: in whom are these treasures, - as hidden treasures" (Ellicott, Lightfoot). (For a similar emphasis of position, compare "made complete," ver. 10, and "seated," <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>.) Meyer and Alford, with the Vulgate, make "hidden" an attributive: "in whom are hidden treasures." Chrysostom and leading versions make it primary predicate: "in whom are hidden," etc., against the order of the words. This word also belongs to the dialect of the mystic theosophists (see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-11</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In this verse the apostle first definitely indicates the cause of his anxiety, and the Epistle begins to assume a polemic tone. This verse is, therefore, the prelude of the impending attack on the false teachers (vers. 8-23). <span class="cmt_word">This I say, that no one may be deluding you in persuasive speech</span> (vers. 8, 18, 23; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>). This was the danger which made a more adequate comprehension of Christianity so necessary to the Colossians (vers. 2, 3). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, one of the numerous <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> of this Epistle (words only used here in the New Testament), compounds into one word the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> ("persuasive words") of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a> (compare "word of wisdom," ver. 23). In classical writers it denotes plausible, <span class="accented">ad captandum</span> reasoning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (only here and <a href="../../par/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> in the New Testament) is "to use bad logic," "to play off fallacies (paralogisms)." The new teachers were fluent, specious reasoners, and had a store of sophistical arguments at command. The tense of the verb indicates an apprehension as to what may be now <span class="accented">going on</span> (vers. 8, 16, 18, 20; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>). We shall see afterwards (vers. 8-23) what was the doctrine underlying this "persuasive speech." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if indeed I am absent in the flesh, yet in the spirit I am with you</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>). The connection of this verse with the last is not obvious. Ellicott, following Chrysostom, makes St. Paul's spiritual presence the reason for his being able to give the Colossians this warning; Meyer, his bodily absence the reason for their needing it. It is better, with Lightfoot, to see here a general explanatory reference to the previous context, a renewed declaration (ver. 1) of watchful interest in these distant brethren and a hearty acknowledgment of their Christian loyalty. The tone of authoritative warning just assumed (ver. 4) is thus justified, and yet softened (compare the apologetic tone of <a href="../../par/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14, 15</a>). The phrase, "if I am absent," does not imply a previous <span class="accented">presence</span> (see note, ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ</span> (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4-8, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>). St. Paul dos not say, "rejoicing in beholding." The consciousness of union with brethren far away, whom he has never seen (ver. 1), is itself a joy; and this joy is heightened by what he sees through the eyes of Epaphras (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 6-8</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>) of the condition of this Church. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> are military terms, denoting the "ordered array" and "solid front" of an army prepared for battle (Lightfoot, Hofmann): comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>.

"Christ Jesus the Lord," is literally, <span class="accented">the Christ Jesus, the Lord</span> - an expression found besides only in <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a> (Revised Text). The prefixed article points out <span class="accented">Christ Jesus</span> in his full style and title as the Person whom the Colossians had received, and received as <span class="accented">the Lord.</span> "The Lord" has a predicative force, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> (R.V.); <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>. "Jesus is Lord" was the testing watchword applied in the discerning of spirits; "Jesus Christ is Lord" is to be the final confession of a reconciled universe; and "Christ Jesus is Lord" is the rule of faith that guides all conduct and tests all doctrine within the Church (comp. ver. 19; <a href="../../par/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). It is "a summary of the whole Christian confession" (Meyer). To vindicate this lordship, on which the Colossian error trenched so seriously, is the main object of the Epistle (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-20</a>). We must not, therefore, with Alford, Lightfoot, Hofmann, analyze "the Christ Jesus:" "Ye received the Christ, (namely) Jesus, who is the Lord." The writer has already used "Christ Jesus" as a single proper name at the outset (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1, 4</a>); and it was the <span class="accented">lordship of Christ Jesus, not the Messiahship of Jesus</span>, that was now in question. In <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5, 28</a> the situation is entirely different. In the following clause, "in him" is emphatic, as in ver. 7 (compare the predominant <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-22</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). Hence the contradiction of figure, "walk, rooted, and builded up," does not obtrude itself. (On "walk," see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; and on "in Christ" in this connection, see notes, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>.)

"Rooted" is perfect participle, in, plying an abiding fact ("fast rooted"); while "builded up" (literally, <span class="accented">upon</span> or <span class="accented">unto</span>) is in the present tense of a continued process, the prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> also implying growth and gain (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>). Meyer and Ellicott view <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> as a mere complement of the latter participle: "being builded in him."

THE CHRISTIAN'S COMPLETENESS IN CHRIST. The apostle has first defined his own doctrinal position in the theological deliverance of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, and has then skilfully brought himself into suitable personal relations with his readers by the statements and appeals of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23-2:7</a>. And now, after a general indication in ver. 4 of the direction in which he is about to strike, he unmasks the battery he has been all the while preparing, and delivers his <span class="accented">attack on the Colossian error</span>, occupying the rest of this second chapter, he denounces <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> its false philosophy of religion (vers. 8-15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its arbitrary and obsolete ceremonialism (vers. 16, 17); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its visionary angel worship (vers. 18, 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> its ascetic rules (vers. 20-22; ver. 23) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>reviewing the whole system in a brief characterization of its most prominent and dangerous features. It will be convenient to treat separately the first of these topics, under the heading already given, which indicates the positive truth developed by St. Paul in antagonism to the error against which he contends - a truth which is the practical application of the theological teaching of the first chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware lest there shall be some one who maketh you his spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit</span> (vers. 4, 18, 23; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). "Beware;" literally, <span class="accented">see</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> it), a common form of warning (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>). The future indicative" shall be," used instead of the more regular subjunctive "should be," implies that what is feared is too likely to prove the case (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> and (with another tense) <a href="../../par/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>). "Some one who maketh (you) his spoil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)" is an expression so distinct and individualizing that it appears to single out a definite, well known person. The denunciations of this Epistle are throughout in the <span class="accented">singular</span> number (vers. 4, 16, 18), in marked contrast with the <span class="accented">plural</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, and that prevails in the apostle's earlier polemical references. It is in harmony with the philosophical, Gnosticizing character of the Colossian heresy that it should rest on the authority of some single teacher, rather than on Scripture or tradition, as did the conservative legalistic Judaism. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, a very rare word, <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> in the New Testament, bears its meaning on its face. It indicates the selfish, partisan spirit, and the overbearing conduct of the false teacher. Against such men St. Paul had forewarned the Ephesian elders (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>). "And empty deceit" stands in a qualifying apposition to "philosophy:" "His philosophy, indeed! "It is no better than a vain deceit." This kind of irony we shall find the writer using with still greater effect in ver. 18. <span class="accented">Deceit is empty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>; distinguish from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">fruitless, vain</span>), which deceives by being a show of what it is not, <span class="accented">a hollow pretence.</span> From the prominence given to this aspect of the new teaching, we infer that it claimed to be a <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, and made this its special distinction and ground of superiority. And this consideration points (comp. Introduction, &sect; 4), to some connection between the system of the Colossian errorists and the Alexandrine Judaism, of which Philo, an elder contemporary of St. Paul, is our chief exponent. The aim of this school, which had now existed for two centuries at least, and had diffused its ideas far and wide, was to transform and sublimate Judaism by interpreting it under philosophical principles. Its teachers endeavoured, in fact, to put the "new wine" of Plato into the old bottles" of Moses, persuading themselves that it was originally there (comp. note on "mystery," <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). In Philo, <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is the name for true religion, whose essence consists in the pursuit and contemplation of pure spiritual truth. Moses and the patriarchs are, with him, all "philosophers;" the writers of the Old Testament" philosophize;" it is" the philosophical man" who holds converse with God. This is the only place where <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is expressly mentioned in the New Testament; in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a> and context it is, however, only verbally wanting. According to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ (vers. 17, 20, 22; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). This clause qualifies "making spoil" (Meyer, Ellicott) rather than "deceit;" human authority and natural reason furnish the principles and the method <span class="accented">according to</span> which the false teacher proceeds. "Tradition" does not necessarily imply antiquity (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>); "of men" is the emphatic part of the phrase. These words are characteristic of St. Paul, who was so profoundly conscious of the supernatural origin of his own doctrine (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31-35</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>). Similarly, "the rudiments of the world" are the crude beginnings of truth, the childishly faulty and imperfect religious conceptions and usages to which the world had attained apart from the revelation of Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>). It is not either Jewish or non-Jewish <span class="accented">elements</span> specifically that are intended. Jew and Greek are one in so far as their religious ideas are "not according to Christ." Greek thought had also contributed its <span class="accented">rudiments</span> to the world's education for Christ: hence, comprehensively, "the rudiments of <span class="accented">the world</span> "(comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). The blending of Greek and Jewish elements in the Colossian theosophy would of itself suggest this generalization, already shadowed forth in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Neander, Hofmann, and Klopper (the latest German commentator), have returned to the view that prevailed amongst the Fathers, from Origen downwards, reading this phrase, both here and in Galatians, in a physical sense, as in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>; the <span class="accented">elementa mundi</span>, "the powers of nature," "heavenly bodies," etc., worshipped by the Gentiles as gods, and which the Jews identified with the angels (ver. 18; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) as God's agents in the direction of the world. This interproration has much to recommend it, but it scarcely harmonizes with the parallel "tradition of men," still less with the context of ver. 20, and is absolutely at variance, as it seems to us, with the argument involved in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Not the doctrine of Christ, but <span class="accented">Christ himself</span> is the substitute for these discarded <span class="accented">rudiments</span> (vers. 17, 20). His Person is the norm and test of truth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-3</a>). The views combatted were "not according to Christ," for they made him something less and lower than that which he is.

"Godhead" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the abstract of "God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), not of the adjective "Divine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate therefore, wrongly, <span class="accented">divinitatis:</span> comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-29.htm">Acts 17:29</a>; Wisd. 18:9), and denotes,"not Divine excellences, but the Divine nature" (Bengel); see Trench's 'Synonyms.' Schenkel and others, guided by a conjecture of Theodoret, have found here the <span class="accented">Church</span>, supporting their view by a very doubtful interpretation of <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. Still more groundless is the identification of this <span class="accented">pleroma</span> with <span class="accented">the created world.</span> The apostle unmistakably affirms that the Divine nature, in its entirety, belongs to the Church's Christ. The literal sense of "bodily" (maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Hofmann, after Chrysostom and Athanasius) has been avoided by those who render it "wholly" (Jerome); "essentially, substantially" (Cyril, Theophylact, Calvin, Klopper), as opposed to "relatively" or "partially;" "truly" (Augustine, Erasmus, Bengel, Bleek), as opposed to "figuretively" (ver. 17). The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (always <span class="accented">literal</span> in classical usage, along with its adjective) occurs only here in the New Testament; the adjective "bodily" in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-22.htm">Luke 3:22</a>. "The body of his flesh" in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a> affords a truer parallel than the language of ver. 17, where <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, bears an exceptional sense (see note). Elsewhere St. Paul balances in similar fashion expressions relating to the twofold nature of Christ (see parallels). The assertion that "all the fulness of Deity" dwells in Christ negatives the Alexandrine "philosophy," with its cloud of mediating angel powers and spiritual emanations; the assertion that it dwells in him <span class="accented">bodily</span> equally condemns that contempt for the body and the material world which was the chief practical tenet of the same school (comp. notes on Colossians 1:22 and Colossians 2:23).

The Colossians were being taught to replace or supplement Christ's offices by those of angel powers (see notes, vers. 15, 18). Philo ('Concerning Dreams,' 1. &sect;&sect; 22, 23) writes thus of the angels: "Free from all bodily encumbrance, endowed with larger and diviner intellect, they are lieutenants of the All ruler, eyes and ears of the great King.

In such a strain the Colossian "philosopher" may have been talking. But if Christ is the Maker and Lord of these invisible powers - (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>), and we are <span class="accented">in him</span>, then we must no longer look to them as our saviours.

"The stripping off of the body" was the ideal of the philosophical ascetics (see note on "body," ver. 23, and quotations from Philo).

Colossians 2:13, 18, 23; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).

"Having been buried" is replaced in the antithesis by the more assertive "ye were raised" (comp. vers. 13, 14; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22, 26</a>). "With" points to the "him" (Christ) of the previous clause (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>). <span class="accented">Faith</span> is the instrumental cause of that which baptism sets forth (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26, 27</a>), and has for its object (not its cause: so Bengel) "the working" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>) "of God."

How needless, then, even if it were legitimate, for a Christian to return to this superseded rite! To heighten his readers' sense of the reality and completeness of the change which as baptized (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">believing</span>) Christians they bad undergone, he describes it now more directly as matter of personal experience.

The false teachers probably stigmatized the uncircumcised state as unholy. The apostle adopts the expression, but refers it to the pre-Christian life of his readers (see vers. 11, 12), when their Gentile uncircumcision was a true type of their moral condition (<a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>).

In the New Testament (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>), as in classical Greek, <span class="accented">dogma</span> is <span class="accented">a decree</span>, setting forth the will of some public authority (comp. note on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, ver. 20). The added clause, "which was opposed to us," affirms the active opposition, as "against us" the essential hostility of the decrees of God's law to our sinful nature (<a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>: comp. <a href="../../par/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13, 14</a>).

A third time in these three verses (12-14) we note the transition from participle to coordinate finite verb; and here, in addition, the aorist tense passes into the perfect ("hath taken"), marking the finality of the removal of the Law's condemning power (<a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>): comp. the opposite transition in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>. The <span class="accented">moral deliverance</span> of ver. 11 is traced up to this <span class="accented">legal release</span>, both contained in our completeness in Christ (ver. 10).

The nails of the cross in piercing Christ pierced the legal instrument which held us debtors, and nullified it; see <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); <a href="../../par/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4-6</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> may suggest the further idea of <span class="accented">nailing up</span> the cancelled document, by way of publication.

It is precisely the same participle that we find in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>, and the writer has just used the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 11) in a corresponding sense (see note <span class="accented">in loc.</span> on the force of the double compound). He employs compounds of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> in the middle voice seventeen times elsewhere, and always in the sense of "putting off [or, 'on'] from one's self;" and there is no sure instance in Greek of the middle verb bearing any other meaning. Yet such critics as Meyer, Eadie, Klopper, cling to the rendering of the Vulgate and our Authorized Version; and not without reason, as we shall see. The Revised margin follows the earlier Latin Fathers and some ancient versions, supplying "his body" as object of the participle, understanding "Christ" as subject. But the context does not, as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>, suggest this ellipsis, and it is arbitrary to make the participle itself mean "having disembodied <span class="accented">himself."</span> Nor has the writer introduced any new subject since ver. 12, where" God" appears as agent of each of the acts of salvation set forth in vers. 12-15. Moreover, "the principalities and the dominions" of this verse must surely be those of ver. 10 and of <a href="../../par/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> (compare the "angels" of ver. 18). We understand St. Patti, therefore, to say "that God [revealing himself in Christ; 'in him,' 15 b] put off and put away those angelic powers through whom he had previously shown himself to men." The Old Testament associates the angels with the creation of the world and the action of the powers of nature (<a href="../../par/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; Psalm cir. 4), and with its great theophanies generally (<a href="../../par/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, etc.); and its hints in this direction were emphasized and extended by the Greek translators of the LXX. <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38, 53</a> (St. Stephen); <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, ascribe to them a special agency in <span class="accented">the giving of the Law.</span> <a href="../../par/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>. and it. show how large a place the doctrine of the mediation of angels filled in Jewish thought at this time, and how it tended to limit the mediatorship of Christ. The mystic developments of Judaism among the Essenes and the Ebionites (Christian Essenes), and in the Cabbala, are full of this belief. And it is a cornerstone of the philosophic mysticism of Alexandria. In Philo the angels are the "Divine <span class="accented">powers," "words," "images</span> of <span class="accented">God,"</span> forming the court and <span class="accented">entourage</span> of the invisible King, by whose means he created and maintains the material world, and holds converse with the souls of men (see quotation, ver. 10). This doctrine, we may suppose, was a chief article of the Colossian heresy. Theodoret's note on ver. 18 is apposite here: "They who defended the Law taught men to worship angels, saying that the Law was given by them. This mischief continued long in Phrygia and Pisidia." The apostle returns to the point from which he started in ver. 10. He has just declared that God has cancelled and removed the Law as an instrument of condemnation; and now adds that he has at the same time thrown off and laid aside the veil of angelic mediation under which, in the administration of that Law, he had withdrawn himself. Both these acts take place "in Christ." Both are necessary to that "access to the Father" which, in the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> view, is the special prerogative of Christian faith (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>), and which the Colossian error doubly barred, by its ascetic ceremonialism and by its angelic mediation. (See, on this passage, Alford; also Peirce's 'Paraphrase and Notes,' 2nd edit., 1729; Robertson Smith, on 'Christ and the Angels,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, second series, vol. 1:138, etc.; A. Sabatier's 'L'Apotre Paul,' p. 220, 2nd edit., 1881.) We are compelled, with all deference to its high authority, to reject the view of the Greek Fathers, to which Ellicott, Lightfoot, and Wordsworth have returned, according to which "Christ in his atoning death [in it; 'the cross,' ver. 15 b] stripped off from himself the Satanic powers." For it requires us to bring in, without grammatical warrant, <span class="accented">"somewhere"</span> (Lightfoot), "Christ" as subject; it puts upon" the principalities and the dominions" a sense foreign to the context, and that cannot be justified by <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the connection is wholly different and the hostile sense of the terms is most explicitly defined; and it presents an idea harsh and unfitting in itself, the incongruity of which such illustrations as those of the <span class="accented">Nessus robe</span> and <span class="accented">Joseph's garment</span> only make more apparent. It is one thing to say that the powers of evil <span class="accented">surrounded</span> Christ and quite another thing to say that he <span class="accented">wore</span> them as we have worn "the body of the flesh" (ver. 11; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>). He made a show (of them) openly, having led them in triumph in him; or, <span class="accented">it</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>:52; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). In this, as in the last verse, we have a finite verb between two participles, one introductory ("having stripped off"), the other explanatory, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to <span class="accented">make a show</span> or <span class="accented">example</span>, occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="../../par/matthew/1-17.htm">Matthew 1:17</a>, where it is compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (Revised Text), giving it a sinister meaning of not belonging to the simple verb. With the angelic <span class="accented">"principalities,"</span> etc., for object, the verb denotes, not a shameful exposure, but "an exhibition of them in their true character and position," such as forbids them to be regarded superstitiously (ver. 18). God exhibited the angels as the subordinates and servants of his Son (ver. 10: camp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>, etc.). "Openly" ( <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">in freedom of speech</span>, a favourite word of St. Paul s) implies the absence of reserve or restraint, rather than mere publicity (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("having triumphed;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a> only other instance of the verb in the New Testament; its use in classical Greek confined to Latinist writers, referring, historically, to the Roman <span class="accented">triumph</span>) presents a formidable difficulty in the way of the interpretation of the verse followed so far. For the common acceptation of the word "triumph" compels us to think of the "principalities," etc., as <span class="accented">hostile</span> (<span class="accented">Satanic</span>); and this, again, as Meyer strongly contends, dictates the rendering "having spoiled" for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. So we are brought into collision with two fixed points of our former exegesis. If we are bound lexically to abide by the reference to the Roman military triumph, then the angelic principalities must be supposed to have stood in a quasi-hostile position to "the kingdom of God and of Christ," <span class="accented">in so far as men had exaggerated their powers and exalted them at Christ's expense</span>, and to have been now robbed of this false pre-eminence. The writer however, ventures to question whether, on philological grounds, a better, native Greek sense cannot be found for this verb. The noun <span class="accented">thriambos</span> ("triumph"), on which it is based, is used, indeed, in the Latin sense as early as Polybius, a writer on Roman history (). But it is extant in a much earlier classical fragment as synonymous with <span class="accented">dithyrambos</span>, denoting "a festal song;" and again in Plutarch, contemporary with St. Paul, it is a name of the Greek god Dionysus, in whose honour such songs were sung, and whose worship was of a choral, processional character. This kinder <span class="accented">triumph</span> was, one may imagine, familiar to the eyes of St. Paul and of his readers, while the spectacle of the Roman triumph was distant and foreign (at least when he wrote 2 Corinthians). We suggest that the apostle's image is taken, beth here and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, from <span class="accented">the festal procession</span> of the Greek divinity, who leads his worshippers along as witnesses of his power and celebrants of his glory. Such a figure fittingly describes the relation and the attitude of the angels to the Divine presence in Christ. Let this suggestion, however, be regarded as precarious or fanciful, the general exposition of the verse is not thereby invalidated. (For further elucidation, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 403-421; 11. p. 78. On "triumph," in 2 Corinthians, see Mr. Waite's <span class="accented">Additional note</span> in 'Speaker's Commentary.') The Revisers omit the marginal "in himself" of the Authorized Version, which correctly, as we think, refers the final <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> to <span class="accented">Christ</span> (ver. 10), though incorrectly implying "Christ" as subject of the verse. It was not only "in the cross" that God unveiled himself, dispensing with angelic theophanies, but in the entire person and work of his Son (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). "Which veil" (for here we may apply the words of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>) "is done away in Christ." So the whole passage (vers. 10-15) ends, as it begins, "in him:" "We are complete in him" - in our conversion from sin to holiness set forth in baptism, and our resurrection from death to life experienced in forgiveness (vers. 11-13); and in the removal at once of the legal bar which forbade our access to God (ver. 14), and of the veil of inferior and partial mediation which obscured his manifestation to us (ver. 15).

The new teachers dictated to the Colossians in these matters from the philosophical, ascetic point of view (see notes on "philosophy," "circumcision," vers. 8, 11), condemning their previous liberty. (For the adverse sense of "judge," comp. <a href="../../par/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4, 10, 13</a>.) The scruples of the "weak brethren" at Rome (<a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>) were partly of an ascetic character, but are not ascribed to any philosophic views. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a> and 10 the question stands on a different footing, being connected with that of the recognition of idolatry (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). In <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a> it is purely a point of Jewish law. In one form or other it was sure to be raised wherever Jewish and Gentile Christians were in social intercourse. Ver. 17 shows that such restrictions are "not according to Christ" (ver. 8), belonging to the system which he has superseded. "Therefore" bases this warning upon the reasoning of the previous context. Tertullian ('Against Marcion,' 5:19) supplies the link connecting this verse with vers. 10, 15, 18, when he says, "The apostle blames those who alleged visions of angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats." The abolishing of angel mediation (ver. 15) robs these restrictions of their supposed authority. The Essenes found in the Nazarite life and the rules for the ministering Jewish priest (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-8.htm">Leviticus 10:8-11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>) their ideal of holiness. Philo also attached a high moral value to abstinence from flesh and wine, and regarded the Levitical distinctions of meats as profoundly symbolic. Or in respect of feast, or new moon, or sabbath (<a href="../../par/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9, 10</a>).

These the Colossian Gentile Christians, disciples of St. Paul through Epaphras, had not hitherto observed (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9, 10</a>). Philosophic Judaists insisted on these institutions, giving them a symbolical and ethical interpretation (see Philo, 'On the Number Seven;' also, 'On the Migration of Abraham,' &sect; 16, where he warns his readers lest, "because the feast is a symbol of the joy of the soul and of thanksgiving towards God," they should imagine they could dispense with it, or "break through any established customs which divine men have instituted").

With St. Paul, they shadow forth prophetically <span class="accented">the concrete facts of the Christian revelation</span>, and therefore are displaced by its advent. The singular verb (literally, <span class="accented">is</span>) quite grammatically combines the particulars of ver. 16 under their common idea of a foreshadowing of the things of Christ; and the present tense affirms here a general truth, not a mere historical fact.

Nothing is said here to discountenance positive Christian institutions, or the observance of the Lord's day in particular, unless enforced in a Judaistic spirit. The apostle is protecting Gentile Christians from the re-imposition of Jewish institutions as such, as impairing their faith in Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-9</a>), and as, in the case of the Colossians, involving a deference to the authority of angels which limited his sovereignty and sufficiency (vers. 8-10, 18, 19). This verse contains in germ much of the thought of the Epistle to the Hebrews.

The errorist condemns the Colossian Christian for his neglect of Jewish observances (ver. 16), and warns him that in his present state he will <span class="accented">miss the heavenly prize</span>, "the hope" he had supposed to be "in store for him in heaven" (ver. 5: comp. notes on Colossians 1:5 and Colossians 3:15; also <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delighting in lowliness of mind and worship of the angels</span> (ver. 23; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17, 18</a>). By these means the false teacher  impressed his disciples. His angel worship commended itself as the mark of a devout and humble mind, reverent towards the unseen powers above us, and made purely <span class="accented">Christian</span> worship seem insufficient. "Delighting in" is the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> given by Bengel, Hofmann, Lightfoot, Klopper, and is preferable to that of Meyer and Ellicott, who, with several Greek interpreters, supply the sense of the previous verb "desiring (to do so) in lowliness etc.; and to that followed in the Revisers' margin,which puts a sort of adverbial sense on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - "of his mere will, by humility," etc. This latter rendering underlies the paraphrastic" voluntary humility" of the A.V., and agrees with the common interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23 (see note). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is, no doubt, a marked Hebraism, and St. Paul's language is "singularly free from Hebraisms" (compare, however, the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to know</span>, in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; the similar <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is well established, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). This very idiom is frequently used in the LXX, and occurs in the 'Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,' a Christian writing, of the second century. The apostle may surely be allowed occasionally to have used a Hebraistic phrase, especially when so convenient and expressive as this. Westcott and Hort, with scrupulous purism, mark the reading on this account as doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> ("lowliness of mind"), a word, perhaps, compounded by St. Paul himself (see Trench's 'Synonyms'), is almost confined to the Epistles of this group (comp. ver. 23; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; also <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). This quality is ascribed <span class="accented">ironically</span> to the false teacher (compare the "puffed up" of the next clause, and for similar irony see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is "outward worship" or "devotion:" comp. note on ver. 23; elsewhere in New Testament only in <a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> and <a href="../../par/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26, 27</a> (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Worship of the angels" is that <span class="accented">paid to the angels</span>; not "offered by them," as Luther and Hofmann interpret, supposing that the errorists pretended to imitate the worship of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Investigating</span> (or, <span class="accented">dwelling on</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the things which he hath seen'! vainly - being puffed up by 'the reason' of his flesh</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:l, 7; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). For <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we adopt the sense which it bears in 2 Macc. 2:30; in Philo, 'On the Planting of Noah,' &sect; 19. and in patristic and later Greek generally, viz. "to search into," "examine," "discuss" (see Suicer's 'Thesaurus'). The rendering "proceeding" or "dwelling on," though near the radical sense of the word ("to step on" or "in"), wants lexical support. The same may be said of the rendering "intruding into," which suits the Received reading, "which he hath <span class="accented">not</span> seen." The "not" of the relative clause is wanting in nearly all our eldest and best witnesses, and is cancelled by the Revisers, with Tregelles, Tischendorf, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, etc. Its appearance in two different forms (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) in the documents that present it, makes it still more certain that it is a copyist's insertion. The common reading gives, after all, an unsatisfactory sense; it is not likely the apostle would blame the errorist simply for entering into things beyond his sight (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Meyer, after Steiger and Huther, gives the best explanation of "which he hath seen," supposing the writer to allude ironically to <span class="accented">pretended visions</span> of angels or of the spiritual world, by which the false teacher sought to impose on the Colossians. This view is suggested by Tertullian in the passage cited under ver. 16. Such visions would be suitable for the purpose of the errorist, and congenial to the Phrygian temperament, with its tendency to mysticism and ecstasy (see Theodoret, quoted under ver. 15, who also says that <span class="accented">angel worship</span> was specially forbidden by the Council of Laodicea, A.n. 364). If the false teacher were accustomed to say with an imposing air, "I have seen, ah! I have seen!" in referring to his revelations, the apostle's allusion would be obvious and telling. The language of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a> (R.V.) suggests a similar reliance on supernatural visions on the part of the apostle's earlier opponents. This pretentious visionary is, however, a "philosopher" and a "reasoner" first of all (vers. 4, 8). Accordingly he <span class="accented">investigates what he has seen</span>; inquires into the import of his visions, rationally develops their principles, and deduces their consequences. So far, the apostle continues in the ironical vein in which the first words of the verse are written, setting forth the pretensions of his opponent in his own terms, his irony "restraining itself till, after the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, the indignation of truth breaks forth from it" (Steiger) in the caustic and decisive "vainly." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span> qualifies the foregoing participle (so Origen, apparently, in Cramer's 'Catena,' vol. 4. p. 69; Steiger, De Wette, Hofmann, Conybeare) more suitably than the following. Thus it signifies "idly," "to no purpose," as everywhere else in St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>); not "without cause," as joined to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("puffed up"), whose 'force it could only weaken. "Vainly" stigmatizes the futility, "puffed up" the conceit, and "by the reason of his flesh" the low and sensuous origin of these vaunted revelations and of the high-flown theosophy which they were used to support. (For the sarcastic force of "puffed up," comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The "reason" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) is, in Greek philosophy, the philosophical faculty, the power of supersensible intuition; and in Plato and Philo, the organ of the higher, mystical knowledge of Divine things (see Philo, 'Who is Heir of Divine Things?' &sect;&sect; 13, 20, and <span class="accented">passim</span>). The Colossian "philosopher" (ver. 8) would, we may imagine, speak of himself as "borne aloft" in his visions "by heavenly reason," "lifted high in angelical communion," or the like. Hence the apostle's sarcasm, "Exalted are they? say rather, <span class="accented">inflated: lifted high by Divine reason?</span> nay, but <span class="accented">swollen high by the reason of their flesh."</span> Some such allusion to the language of the errorists best accounts for the paradoxical <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Lightfoot); contrast with <a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, and compare the disparaging reference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">Colossians</span> 1:21 (note).

In the last verse the errorist was judged "out of his own mouth," and the intrinsic hollowness of his pretensions was exposed. Now" he appears before the judgment seat of Christ," charged with high treason against him, the Lord alike of the kingdoms of nature and of grace. So the apostle falls back once more (comp. ver. 10) on the foundation laid down in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, on which his whole polemic rests. Both in creation and redemption, the philosophic Judaists assigned to the angels a <span class="accented">role</span> inconsistent with the sovereign mediatorship of Christ (see notes on vers. 10 and 15). <span class="cmt_word">From whom all the body, through its joinings and bands being supplied and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God</span> (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>).

Gnosticism from the beginning tended to disintegrate the Church, by the caste feeling (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>, note; Colossians 3:11) and the sectarian spirit to which it gave birth (ver. 8; <a href="../../par/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). Its vague and subjective doctrines were ready to assume a different form with each new exponent, Here lies the connection between this and the Ephesian letter, the doctrine of the Church following upon and growing out of that of the person of Christ, each being threatened - the latter immediately, the former more remotely  - by the rise of the new Judaeo-Christian mystic rationalism. Colossians asserts the "thou in me" of <a href="../../par/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>; Ephesians the corresponding "I in them;" and both the consequent "they made perfect in one" (comp., especially, <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a> and Ephesians 4:7-16 with <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> and Colossians 2:9-15).

So, by the organic cooperation of the whole structure, the body of Christ is <span class="accented">furnished with its supplies</span>, enabled to receive and dispense to each member the needed sustenance; and "knit together" (ver. 2), drawn into a close and firm unity. "Supplied" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>) indicates a sustenance both required and due. In <a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> we read of <span class="accented">the increase of the gospel</span>, in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a> of <span class="accented">the individual believer</span>, and now of <span class="accented">the Church as a body</span>) <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>). "The increase of God" is that which God bestows (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>), as it proceeds "from Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: ver. 10; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), in whom is "the fulness of the Godhead" (ver. 9: comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a> and Ephesians 3:17  - 19). In <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> the same idea is expressed in almost the same terms. There, however, the growth appears as proper to the body, resulting from its very constitution; here, as a bestowment of God, dependent, therefore, upon Christ, and ceasing if the Church ceases to <span class="accented">hold fast</span> to him.

This warning, like those of vers. 16, 18, looks back to the previous section, and especially to vers. 8, 10, 12. It is a new application of St. Paul's fundamental principle of the union of the Christian with Christ in his death and resurrection (see notes, vers. 11, 12).

On "rudiments," see note, ver. 8. There these "rudiments of the world" appear as general ("philosophical") principles of religion, intrinsically false and empty; here they are moral rules of life, mean and worthless substitutes for "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus."

To adopt the rules of the new teachers is to return to the worldly, pre-Christian type of religion which the Christian had once for all abandoned (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>). "World" bears the emphasis rather than "living" ("having one's principle of life:" comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-6.htm">1 Timothy 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>). Standing without the article, it signifies "the world as such," in its natural character and attainments, without Christ (ver. 8; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> (the verb only here in the New Testament) is passive rather than middle in voice (Winer, p. 326; see Meyer <span class="accented">in loc.</span>); literally, <span class="accented">why are yon being dogmatized, overridden with decrees?</span> Compare "spell" (ver. 8), "judge" (ver. 16), for the domineering spirit of the false teacher.

These rules form part of a prohibitory regimen by which sinful tendencies to bodily pleasure were to be repressed (ver. 23), and spiritual truths symbolically enforced (ver. 17; see note on "circumcision," ver. 11): comp.

This is the position which Christ himself takes in regard to Jewish distinctions of meats (<a href="../../par/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>, R.V.). We note the same style of sarcastic comment on the language of the false teachers as that exhibited in ver. 18. Augustine, Calvin, and some ethers render, "which (decrees) tend to (spiritual) destruction in their use;" but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> never means simply "use," and the antecedent "decrees" is awkwardly supplied. More plausibly, De Wette and some moderns interpret, "things which tend to (spiritual) destruction in their abuse," putting the words in the mouth of the false teacher, as though he said, "Abstain from everything the use of which may be fatal to the soul." But this ascribes to the errorist an argument which fails short of his principles (see note on "hard treatment of the body," ver. 23); and to which, specious as it is, and in harmony with the apostle's own teaching (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26, 27</a>), he makes no reply. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandments and teachings of men</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, LXX; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7</a>; ver. 8; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5, 13</a>); the only passage in this Epistle which distinctly alludes to the language of the Old Testament. But the words are, we may suppose, primarily a reminiscence of the language of Christ, who uses them in connection with his announcement of the abolition of the sacred distinctions of meats (comp. <a href="../../par/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>). This clause points out the method after which, and direction in which, the new teachers were leading their disciples, on the line of a man-made instead of a God given religion. "Commandments" (or, "injunctions") include the prescriptions of ver. 21 and all others like them; "teachings" embrace the general principles and doctrines on which these rules were based. So this expression, following "rudiments of the world (ver. 20), leads us back by a rapid generalization from the particulars specified in ver. 21 to the general starting point given in ver. 8 (see note), and prepares us for the brief and energetic summary of the whole Colossian error which we find in - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Such as have</span> (literally, <span class="accented">are</span> (<span class="accented">things</span>) <span class="accented">having</span>) <span class="cmt_word">word indeed of wisdom</span> (vers. 4, 8; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>). The antecedent of "such as" is "command merits and teachings" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott), not "decrees" (ver. 21). For ver. 22 supplies the immediate antecedent, and the wider sense thus given is necessary to support the comprehensive and summary import of ver. 23. The Greek "are having" brings into view the nature and qualities of the subject, in accordance with <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">such as</span>, the <span class="accented">qualitative</span> relative (comp. <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; see Moulton's Winer, pp. 209, 210; also Meyer and Ellicott, on the grammatical point). A certain "word of wisdom" was ascribed to the false teachers in ver. 4 (note the play upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in St. Paul's Greek). They were plausible dealers in words, and had the jargon of philosophy at their tongue's end (ver. 8, compare note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 18). On this the apostle had first remarked in his criticism of their teaching, and to this he first, adverts in his final <span class="accented">resume.</span> "Word of wisdom" is one of the "gifts of the Spirit" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>; but the disparaging <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, with the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> throwing <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> into the shade, in view also of the censures already passed in vers. 4, 8, puts a condemnatory sense upon the phrase: "having <span class="accented">word</span> indeed of wisdom" - "that and nothing more, no inner truth, no pith and substance of wisdom" (so Chrysostom and OEcumenius). "Word and deed," "word and truth," form a standing antithesis (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>, etc.), the second member of which supplies itself to the mind; and the <span class="accented">solitary</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> in such a connection is a well-established classical idiom (see Winer's or A. Buttmann's 'Grammar;' also Meyer). It is superfluous, therefore, as well as confusing to the order of thought, to seek in the sequel for the missing half of the antithesis. Other renderings of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> - "show" (English A.V., Bengel, De Wette), "ground" or "reason" (Vulgate, Klopper), <span class="accented">"reputation"</span> (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot) - are partly doubtful or exceptional in point of usage, and partly overlook the pointed reference of vers. 22, 23 to the language of vers. 4 and 8. And the combination of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> into a single phrase is scarcely justified here in face of the established Pauline association of "word" and "wisdom" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-2:16</a>, as well as 1 Corinthians 12:8). Both in this Epistle and in 1 Corinthians the writer is contending against forms of error which found their account in the Greek love of eloquence and of dexterous word-play. While the first part of the predicate, therefore, explains the <span class="accented">intellectual attractiveness</span> of the Colossian error, the clause next following accounts for its <span class="accented">religious fascination</span>; and the third part of the verse strikes at the root of its <span class="accented">ethical and practical applications.</span> (Shown) <span class="cmt_word">in</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>devotion to</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>worship</span> (or, <span class="accented">voluntary worship</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and lowliness of mind</span> (ver. 18). The preposition "in" brings us into the moral and religious sphere of life in which this would be wisdom of doctrine had its range and found its application. The prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span>  =  - of<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ordinarily connotes" willingness" rather than "wilfulness;" and the "delighting in worship" of ver. 18 (see note) points strongly in this direction. As against Ellicott and Lightfoot on the etymological point, see Hofmann, pp. 102, 103. Only so far as the <span class="accented">worship</span> in question (see note, ver. 18, on "worship") is evil, can the <span class="accented">having a will to worship</span> be evil. The other characteristics of the error marked in this verse seem to be recommendations, and "devotion to worship" is in keeping with them. This disposition, moreover, has an air of "humility," which does not belong to a <span class="accented">self-imposed, arbitrary worship.</span> There is a love of worship for mere worship's sake which is a perversion of the religious instinct, and tends to multiply both the forms and objects of devotion. This spurious religiousness took the form, in the Colossian errorists, of <span class="accented">worship paid to the angels.</span> On this particular worship the apostle passed his judgment in ver. 18, and now points out the tendency from which it springs. In ver. 18 "humility" precedes; here it follows "worship," by way of transition from the religious to the moral aspect of the now teaching. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unsparing treatment of</span> (the) body - <span class="cmt_word">not in any honour</span> (as) <span class="cmt_word">against surfeiting of the flesh</span> (vers. 16, 21, 22; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-23.htm">1 Corinthians 12:23-25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>). The "and" linking this clause to the last under the government of "in," is textually doubtful; Lightfoot cancels it; Westcott and Hort give the omission as a secondary reading. Mr. Hort regards the passage, like ver. 18, as hopelessly corrupt - a verdict which we would fain believe is too despairing. If <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> be struck out, then <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> must be attached, somewhat loosely, to the principal predicate (" are having") as an instrumental dative. On either construction, the sense appears to be that it was its combination of ascetic rigour with religious devotion that gave to the system in question its undoubted charm, and furnished an adequate field for the eloquence and philosophical skill of its advocate. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">unsparingness</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">surfeiting - both</span> found only here in the New Testament - and along with them "body" and "flesh," stand opposed to each other. This clause, therefore, contains a complete sense, and we must not look outside it for an explanation of the included words, "not in any honour." As we have seen, the first clause of the predicate (" having word indeed," etc.) needs no such complement. The clause "not .... flesh" is a comment on the words, "unsparing treatment of the body." On this topic the apostle had not yet expressed his mind sufficiently. He has in vers. 16, 20-22 denounced certain ascetic rules as obsolete, or as trifling and needless; but he has yet to expose the principle and tendency from which they sprang. He is the more bound to be explicit on this subject inasmuch as there were ascetic leanings in his own teaching, and passages in his earlier Epistles such as <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, which the "philosophical" party might net unnaturally wrest to their own purposes. He could not condemn severity to the body absolutely, and in every sense. The Colossian rigorism he does condemn - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as not <span class="accented">in keeping with bodily self-respect</span>, which is the safeguard of Christian purity; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as not in reality <span class="accented">directed against sensual indulgence</span>, the prevention of which is the proper end of rules of abstinence. These two objections are thrown into a single terse, energetic negative clause, obscure, like so much in this chapter, from its brevity and want of connecting particles. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> the phrase, "in honour," occurs in a similar connection: "That each one of you know how to 'gain possession of his own vessel" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to become master of his body:" see Wordsworth and Alford on the passage; also Meyer's reference on <a href="../../par/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>) "in sanctification and <span class="accented">honor"</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a> for the apostle's teaching respecting the dignity of the human body; also <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>). The contempt of Alexandrine theosophists for physical nature was fatal to morality, undermining the basis on which rests the government of the body as the "vessel" and vesture of the spiritual life. Their principles took effect, first, in a morbid and unnatural asceticism; then, by a sure reaction, and with equal consistency, in unrestrained and shocking licence. See, for the latter result, the Epistles to the seven Churches of Asia (<a href="../../par/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. and 3.); in the Pastoral Epistles, the two opposite effects are both signalized. The rendering "value" given by Lightfoot and the Revisers seems to us misleading; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> means "value" only in the sense of "price," as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, and this surely is not their meaning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> has been taken in a milder sense by the Greek commentators, Luther, and others: "satisfaction" "(<span class="accented">legitimate</span>) gratification." So the apostle is made to charge the false teachers with "not honouring the body, so as to grant the flesh its due gratification." But this rendering confounds the "body" and the "flesh," here contrasted, and gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> a meaning without lexical warrant (see Meyer and Lightfoot). And the sentiment it expresses errs on the anti-ascetic side, and comes into collision with <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, in the LXX and in Philo, as in earlier Greek, denotes "physical repletion," and is associated with drunkenness and sensual excess generally. Hence we cannot admit the interpretation of Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, who make the "flesh" here the <span class="accented">sinful principle</span> generally, and understand "surfeiting" figuratively, supposing the apostle to mean, that the ascetic rules in question, while they dishonour the body, tend to gratify the carnal mind." This gives an idea true in itself, and agreeing with the sense of "flesh" in vers. 11, 18, but out of place here, while it strains the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> (see Lightfoot's exhaustive argument). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not help us, meaning "for" or "against," according to its connection. We combine Lightfoot's interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> with Wordsworth's and <span class="accented">Alford's</span> of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>. The saying of <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a> ("whose god is their belly, and their glory in their shame") contains the same opposition of "honour" to "fleshly indulgence" as that supposed here, possibly suggested by the phrase, "surfeiting of dishonor" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), of the LXX in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>. Here, then, the apostle lays hold of the root principle of the false teachers' whole scheme of morality, its <span class="accented">hostility to the body as a material organism.</span> Such a treatment, he declares, dishonours the body, while it fails, and for this very reason, to prevent <span class="accented">that feeding of the flesh</span>, the fostering of sensual appetency and habit, in which lies our real peril and dishonour in regard to this vessel of our earthly life. Here we have a suitable starting-point for the exhortations of the next chapter, where the apostle, in vers. 1-4, shows the true path of deliverance from sensual sin, and in vers. 5-7 sets forth the Christian asceticism - "unsparing treatment" <span class="accented">of the flesh</span> indeed! The line of teaching adopted by the errorists may be illustrated by Philo's doctrine in his third book of the 'Allegories of the Sacred Law,' &sect; 22: "'God saw that Er was wicked;' for he knows that this <span class="accented">leathern burden</span> of ours, the body - for <span class="accented">Er</span>, being interpreted, is <span class="accented">leathern</span>  - is evil and always plotting against the soul; and it is ever under the power of death, indeed actually dead [comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>]. Yet this all do not see, but only God, and those he loves. For when the mind [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> comp. note, ver. 18] becomes engaged in sublime contemplations and is initiated into the mysteries of the Lord [note, <a href="../../par/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>], it judges the body to be evil and hostile;" again ('On the Change of Names,' &sect; 4): "Pale and wasted,  and reduced to skeletons as it were, are the men devoted to instruction, having transferred to the powers of the soul their bodily vigour also, so that they have become, as we might say, dissolved into a single form of being, that of pure soul made bodiless by force of thought [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see <a href="../../par/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, note]. In them the earthly is destroyed and overwhelmed, when reason [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>: ver. 18], pervading them wholly, has see its choice on being well pleasing to God."
