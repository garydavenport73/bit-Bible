The prophet now denounces the other nation connected by ties of blood with Israel (see on Amos 1:13). Moab's hostility had been shown in the hiring of Balsam to curse the Israelites, and in seducing them to idolatry (<a href="../../par/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-25:3</a>). He was their oppressor in the time of the Judges (<a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12</a>); and David had to take most stringent measures against him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>). The Moabites joined in a league against Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>), and later against Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>), and, as we see by the inscription on the Moabite Stone, were always ready to profit by the disasters or weakness of the chosen people. "I erected this stone," says Mesha, "to Chemosh at Kirkha, a stone of salvation, for he saved me from all despoilers, and made me see my desire upon all mine enemies, even upon Omri, King of Israel." And then he goes on to recount his victories. <span class="cmt_word">He burned the bones of the King of Edom into lime.</span> This profanation of the corpse of the King of Edom (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-1.htm">Jeremiah 8:1, 2</a>) is not mentioned in the historical books. Some of the older commentators, as Tirinus and Corn. a Lapide, think that the prophet wishes to show that the sympathy of God extends beyond the covenant people, and that he punishes wrongs inflicted even on heathen nations. But as in the case of the other nations, Amos reproves only crimes committed against Israel or Judah, so the present outrage must have the same connection. The reference to the King of Moab's sacrifice of "his eldest son," even if we suppose (which is improbable) the son of the King of Edom to be meant, is plainly inapplicable (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>), as the offence regarded the king himself, and not his son, and the expression, "burned into lime," can hardly be thought to refer to a human sacrifice. The act mentioned probably occurred during the time that the Edomites joined Jehoram and Jehoshaphat in the league against Mesha, the King of Moab (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7, 9</a>), the author of the inscription on the celebrated stone erected by him at Dibon. Unfortunately, the last lines of that inscription, describing the war against the Edomites, are lost. The paragraph that remains is this: "And Chemosh said to me, Go down, make war against Horonaim [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Edom], and take...  Chemosh...  in my days. Wherefore I made...  year ... and I..." The Jewish tradition, quoted by Jerome, tells that after this war the Moabites, in revenge for the assistance which the King of Edom had given to the Israelites, dug up and dishonoured his bones. Edom was then in vassalage to Israel, but regained its independence some ten years  later (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>). The sacrilegious act was meant to redound to the disgrace of Israel

There is no ground for deducing, as Hitzig and Ewald do, from the use of this form that Moab had no king at this time.

The former likewise had offended against the law of conscience, natural religion; the latter against the written Law, revealed religion. By thus denouncing Judah, Amos shows his perfect impartiality.

Pusey thinks that the literal selling of debtors by creditors, contrary to the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>), is meant (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/8-6.htm">Amos 8:6</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The needy for a pair of shoes.</span> For the very smallest bribe they betray the cause of the poor (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>); though, as sandals were sometimes of very costly materials (<a href="../../par/songs/7-1.htm">Song of Solomon 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-10.htm">Ezekiel 16:10</a>; Judith 16:9), the expression might mean that they sold justice to obtain an article of luxury. But the form of expression is opposed to this interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the <i>same</i> maid, to profane my holy name:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor.</span> This is the second charge - oppression of the poor. The obscure expression in the text is capable of two explanations. Hitzig, Pusey, Trochon, assume that its meaning is that in their avarice and cupidity the usurers or tyrannous rich men grudge even the dust which the poor man strews upon his head in token of his sorrow at being brought to so low a state. But this seems unnatural and farfetched, and scarcely in harmony with the simple style of Amos. The other explanation, supported by Kimchi, Sehegg, Keil, and Knabenbauer, is preferable. These oppressors desire eagerly to see the poor crushed to the earth, or so miserable as to scatter dust on their heads (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>). <span class="accented">The poor</span> (<span class="accented">dal</span>, not the same word as in ver. 6); <span class="accented">depressed</span>, as brought low in condition. The Septuagint joins this with the previous clause, "And the poor for sandals, the things that tread on the dust of the earth, and smote on the heads of the needy." The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Qui conterunt super pulverem terrae capita pauperum</span>, "Who bruise the heads of the poor on the dust of the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Turn aside the way of the meek.</span> They thwart and hinder their path of life, and force them into crooked and evil ways. Or <span class="accented">way</span>, according to Kimchi, may mean "judicial process," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>. This gives, to the clause much the same meaning as ver. 6. <span class="accented">The meek</span> are those who are lowly and unassuming (see note on Zephaniah 2:3). <span class="cmt_word">And a man</span>  <span class="cmt_word">and his father will go in unto the same maid;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate, which omits "the same," is closer to the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Et filius ac pater ejus ierunt ad puellam</span>, though the Greek doubtless gives the intended meaning. This sin, which was tantamount to incest, was virtually forbidden (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>). Some (as Ewald, Maurer, Gandell) see here an allusion to the organized prostitution in idol temples (<a href="../../par/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a>), but this seems unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">To profane my holy Name</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>). Such crimes dishonoured the God who called them his people, so that to them could be applied what St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>), "The Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you" (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20, 23</a>). The word <span class="accented">lemaan</span>, "in order that," implies that they committed these sins, not through ignorance, but intentionally, to bring discredit upon the true faith and worship.

Thus Amos himself was treated (<a href="../../par/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>, etc.). (For proof of this opposition, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-10.htm">1 Kings 18:10</a>, etc.; 1 Kings 19:2; 22:26, 27; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-31.htm">2 Kings 6:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-15.htm">2 Chronicles 25:15, 16</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>.

The translation of Keil, which is that of Gesenius, is most suitable, meaning, "I will press you with the full force of war, as a loaded wain presses the earth over which it passes." The sense of the English Version is that God is burdened and wearied with their sins, as <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-24.htm">Isaiah 43:24</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-17.htm">Malachi 2:17</a>. The verb, being hiphil, is an objection to this explanation. The comparison of the wain is very natural in the mouth of the shepherd Amos.
