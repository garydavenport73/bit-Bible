If the views broached by these Judaean Christians had prevailed, the whole character of Christianity would have been changed, and its existence probably cut short. How great the danger was appears from even Peter and Barnabas having wavered in their opinion. (For St. Paul's treatment of the subject, see <a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>, etc.; 4; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12-15</a>, etc.) The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is so like that in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> as to suggest very strongly the consideration whether Peter was not at Antioch at this time, and whether the scene related in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc., did not precede, and in fact cause, the Council of Jerusalem. In this case the "dissension and disputation" spoken of in ver. 2 would include and directly point to the memorable rebuke given by Paul to Peter; and we should understand that Peter, accepting Paul's rebuke, preceded him and Barnabas, and prepared the way at Jerusalem for the solution arrived at. And, indeed, Peter's words at Jerusalem are almost an echo of Paul's words addressed to him at Antioch. If Barnabas had shown a leaning towards the Judaizing party, he would the more readily have been accepted by them as one of the embassy. The chief objection to this hypothesis is that in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a> Peter's visit to Antioch seems to be spoken of as something subsequent to the journey of St. Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. But it is not in the least necessary so to understand it. St, Paul's mention of his visit to Jerusalem might naturally recall the incident which had led to it, and which was another example of his own independence. Farrar places Peter's visit to Antioch between the Council of Jerusalem and the quarrel with Barnabas, in the time indicated in ver. 35 of this chapter (vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/23.htm">Acts 23</a>.), and so do Conybeare and Howson (vol. 1. p. 238), Meyer, and Alford ('Proleg.,' p. 24; note on Acts 15:36, and <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>). Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 290, etc.) and Lewin (vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.) place it after St. Paul's return to Antioch, at the conclusion of his second missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22, 23</a>). No absolute certainty can be arrived at, but see note to ver. 35. <span class="cmt_word">Custom</span> (see <a href="../../par/acts/16-21.htm">Acts 16:21</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is the technical term for the Mosaic institutions, used by Josephus and Philo (see too <a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - And <span class="accented">when</span> for <span class="accented">when therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questioning</span> for <span class="accented">disputation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the brethren</span> (in italics) <span class="accented">appointed</span> for <span class="accented">they determined</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Certain other of them</span>. One of these would be Titus (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>). The circumstance that, on this occasion, St. Paul did go up to those who were apostles before him, to consult with them on a matter of doctrine, shows at once why he refers so pointedly to this visit in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, etc., and is almost conclusive evidence that this visit is the one there referred to. The companionship of Barnabas; the agreement of the expression, "I went up by revelation," with the fact that he was sent by the Church, doubtless in obedience to some voice of the Spirit, like that mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; the occasion, a dispute about the circumcision of Gentile converts; the line taken by Paul and Barnabas in declaring the conversion of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:27), and the result (<a href="../../par/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5, 7, 9</a>), are all strong, not to say conclusive, marks of the identity of the two visits. <span class="cmt_word">The apostles and elders</span>. This phrase marks the constitution of the governing part of the Church of Jerusalem. The addition in vers. 22 and 23 of "the whole Church," and (according to the T.R.) of "the brethren," shows the part the body of the believers had in approving and sanctioning the decisions of the elders. The transaction marks the position of the Church of Jerusalem as the metropolitan Church of Christendom.

This, of course, would have included Titus, who was present with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 3</a>). The Epistle to the Galatians deals directly and forcibly with this question.

There is every appearance of the LXX., followed here by St. James, having preserved the true reading. As regards the reading of the R.V. in ver. 18, it is a manifest corruption. It is not the reading of either the Hebrew or the Greek version of Amos, or of any other version; and it makes no sense. Whereas the T.R., which is the reading of Irenaeus (3:12.), as Meyer truly says, "presents a thought completely clear, pious, noble, and inoffensive as regards the connection," though he thinks that a reason for rejecting it. Nothing could be more germane to St. James's argument than thus to show from the words of Amos that God's present purpose of taking the Gentiles to be his people was, like all his other works, formed from the beginning of the world (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, etc.). As regards the interpretation of the prophecy of Amos intended, the idea seems to be that that apparent ruin of the house and family of David which culminated in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus would be followed by those "sure mercies of David," which consisted in his resurrection from the dead, his exaltation to the right hand of God, and the gathering in of the Gentiles to his kingdom. The phrase, "the tabernacle of David," is rather difficult, because the word in the Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, tabernacle or booth of David. It is the word used for the booths at the Feast of Tabernacles, and denotes a temporary shed of branches or the like of a very humble character. It is difficult to say why this word was used, unless it was to show that the house of David had fallen to a low estate before it was pulled down.

Later St. Paul somewhat enlarged the liberty of Gentile converts in respect to meats offered to idols (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-25.htm">1 Corinthians 10:25-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What is strangled</span>, etc. The things forbidden are all practices not looked upon as sins by Gentiles, but now enjoined upon them as portions of the Law of Moses which were to be binding upon them, at least for a time, with a view to their living in communion and fellowship with their Jewish brethren. The necessity for some of the prohibitions would cease when the condition of the Church as regards Jews and Gentiles was altered; others were of eternal obligation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a></div><div class="verse">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - From <span class="accented">generations of old</span> for <span class="accented">of old time</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sabbath</span> for <span class="accented">sabbath day</span>, A.V. The meaning of this verse seems to be that, in requiring the above compliances, the council was not enjoining anything new or strange, because the Gentiles who attended the synagogues were familiar with these Mosaic doctrines. It has been often stated that these four prohibitions were in substance the same as the so-called seven precepts of Noah, which were binding upon proselytes of the gate. This is, however, scarcely borne out by the facts. The four prohibitions seem to have been a temporary arrangement adapted to the then condition of the Church, with a view to enabling Christian Jews and Gentiles to live in brotherly fellowship. The Jew was not to require more of his Gentile brother: the Gentile was not to concede less to his Jewish brother. St. Augustine ('Cont. Manich.,' 32, 13), quoted by Meyer, ridicules the idea of Christians in his time being bound by the law of things strangled (see Hooker and Bishop Sanderson, quoted by Wordsworth, in the same sense).

Nothing is so unsettling as controversy; but the preaching of these "chief men" brought back men's minds to the solid faith and hope of the gospel. How rich the Church of Antioch was at this time, with Paul and Barnabas, Judas and Silas, and probably Titus, and some, if not all, of those mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, for their teachers.

It seems to have been put in to explain ver. 40. But Silas may have returned to Jerusalem, as stated in ver. 33, and come back again to Antioch, from having formed a strong attachment to St. Paul and his views.

It is at this time that Meyer and other commentators (see ver. 1, note) place Peter's visit to Antioch mentioned in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>. But it is quite inconceivable that Peter, with all the influence of the Jerusalem Cornell fresh upon him, and after the part he himself took in it, and when his own emissaries, Silas and Judas, had just left Antioch, should act the part there ascribed to him. Nor is it within the region of probability that, so soon after the council, any should have come "from James" to unsay what James had said and written at the council. We may with much confidence place Peter's visit to Antioch before the council, as suggested in note to ver. 1.

The expression in Greek is quite indefinite as to time, and may cover months as well as days. That it does cover a considerable length of time we gather from the expression in ver. 33, that Judas and Silas "tarried some time at Jerusalem," followed by that in ver. 35, that after their departure "Paul and Barnabas tarried (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">in</span> Antioch." We can hardly suppose the two periods together to have included much less than a year. <span class="cmt_word">Let us return</span>, etc. The singular loving care of Paul for his young converts appears here (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>, etc.).

Singularly enough, Alford, who rejects <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, which is the reading of R.T., translates <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> by "was minded," which is the translation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in the R.V. We see in this choice of Mark by Barnabas the natural partiality of a near relation. We may also see the same flexibility of disposition which made him yield to the influence of the emissaries of James (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who was called</span>. It might seem odd that this description of John should be repeated here after having been given in <a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>. But perhaps it was usual so to designate him (see <a href="../../par/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-6.htm">Acts 10:6</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a></div><div class="verse">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Take with them him</span> for <span class="accented">take him with them</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">withdrew</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Withdrew</span>. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (from which comes the substantive <span class="accented">apostasy</span>) is a strong one, and denotes decided blame, as does the indication of the opposite course, by way of contrast, which he did not take. "He did not go with them to <span class="accented">the work"</span> to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded. "Paul thought good," as regards one who had turned back from the work, "not <span class="accented">to take</span> that man." The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 38 is, as Meyer observes, sharply opposed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 37. Luke evidently sides strongly with Paul, and almost reproduces the <span class="accented">ipsis-sima verba</span> of the "sharp contention." One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of "The Acts." Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure "from the work" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a></div><div class="verse">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - There <span class="accented">arose a sharp contention</span> for <span class="accented">the contention was so sharp between them</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">parted</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">so that</span> for <span class="accented">so sharp</span>...  <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and Barnabas</span> for <span class="accented">and so Barnabas</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">took Mark with him</span> for <span class="accented">took Mark</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sailed away</span> for <span class="accented">sailed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There arose a sharp contention</span>, etc. The sense "between them" must be supplied, if the English word "contention" is used.

But it is more probable that St. <span class="accented">Luke</span> uses the word here in its common medical sense. In medical writers  - Galen, Hippocrates, etc. - the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to what we call <span class="accented">an access</span>, from the Latin <span class="accented">aecessio</span>, used by Celsus, when a disease of some standing takes a turn for the worse, comes to a height, and breaks out into its severest form. This is the sense in which our English word "paroxysm" is used. The meaning of the passage will then be that, after a good deal of uncomfortable feeling and discussion, the difference between Paul and Barnabas, instead of cooling down, broke out into such an acute form that Barnabas went off to Cyprus with Mark, leaving St. Paul to do what he pleased by himself. <span class="cmt_word">And Barnabas</span>, etc. The R.V. is much more accurate. The consequence of the quarrel is said by St. Luke to have been that Barnabas took Mark off with him to Cyprus. The statement that Paul chose Silas is a separate and independent statement, as appears by <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in the nominative) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in the indicative mood. St. Luke's narrative quite sides with St. Paul, and throws the blame of the quarrel, or at least of the separation, upon Barnabas. Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 119) thinks St. Paul was too severe upon John Mark, and that it was ungrateful of him to break with one to whom he owed so much as he did to Barnabas for any cause of secondary importance. He also thinks that the real root of the quarrel lay in the constantly changing relations between the two apostles, aggravated by a domineering spirit in St. Paul. But the force of this censure turns upon the question whether it was a cause of <span class="accented">secondary</span> importance. If St. Paul had a single eye to the success of his mission, and judged that Mark would be a hindrance to it, it was a question <span class="accented">of primary</span> importance to "the work," and St. Paul was right. Renan also remarks upon the extinction of the fame of Barnabas consequent upon this separation from his more illustrious companion. "While Paul kept advancing to the heights of his glory, Barnabas, separated from the companion who had shed a portion of his own luster upon him, pursued his solitary course in obscurity." <span class="cmt_word">Sailed away</span>. Cyprus was Barnabas's native country (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), and the scene of the earliest mission (<a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), and of Paul and Barnabas's first joint evangelistic labors (<a href="../../par/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>). Barnabas would have many friends there, and could form plans at his leisure for his future action. The friendly mention of him in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> shows both that he continued his disinterested labors as an apostle and that the estrangement between him and St. Paul had passed away. The <span class="accented">paroxysm</span> had yielded to the gentle treatment of charity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a></div><div class="verse">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">went forth</span> or <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">commended</span> for <span class="accented">recommended</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Lord</span> for <span class="accented">God</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Chose Silas</span>. If ver. 34 of the T.R. is a true reading, it accounts for the presence of Silas at Antioch. Otherwise there is no difficulty in supposing that Silas, attracted by the holy zeal of St. Paul and by desire to work among the Gentiles, had come back to Antioch after giving account to the apostles at Jerusalem of the success of his mission with Judas to the Churches at Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.

This rather looks as if the "some days after" of ver. 36 did not cover a very long time, because the special mention of "the Churches of Syria and Cilicia" indicates that St. Paul's visit had some connection with the epistle addressed to them by the apostles and elders of the Church of Jerusalem (ver. 23), as we see from <a href="../../par/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a> was the case. <span class="cmt_word">Confirming</span>; as <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a> (T.R.).
