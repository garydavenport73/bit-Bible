He adds "and fathers" out of respect to the elder and more dignified portion of the Sanhedrim. It seems probable that Stephen, as a Hellenist Jew, spoke in Greek, which is borne out by the quotations being from the LXX. (see Alford), though Meyer and others think he spoke in Hebrew. Greek was generally understood at this time by all educated persons (see Roberts, 'Discussions on Gospels,' <a href="../../par/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. - 7.). The speech itself is almost universally admitted to bear strong internal marks of genuineness and originality. But different estimates have been formed of its excellence, and different explanations given of its scope and object. Difficult but striking; long and prolix;" "at first sight absurd and out of place;" "wonderful but difficult;" "of inestimable value;" "a speech containing many things which don't seem much to the point;" "a powerful speech;" a speech combining "the address of the advocate and the boldness of the martyr;" - are some of the estimates that have been formed of it by modern commentators. As regards its scope and object, the two main clues to it are the accusation which Stephen rose to rebut, and the application with which he ended in vers. 51-53. If we keep these two things steadily in view, we shall not be very far wrong if we say that Stephen sought to clear himself by showing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his historical summary, what a true and thorough Israelite he was in heart and feeling and fellowship with the fathers of his race, and therefore how unlikely to speak blasphemous words against either Moses or the temple; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> how Moses himself had foretold the coming of Christ as a prophet like himself, to enunciate some new doctrines; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> how at every stage of their history their fathers had resisted those who were sent to them by God, and that now his judges were playing the same part. Perhaps it may be further true, as Chrysostom explains it (Hom. 15, 16, 17.), that his intention in the early part of the speech was to show "that the promise was made before the place, before circumcision, before sacrifice, before the temple," in accordance with St. Paul's argument (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16-18</a>); and that therefore the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant could not be dependent upon the Law or the temple. <span class="cmt_word">The God of glory</span>. This unusual phrase identifies God, of whom Stephen speaks, with the God whose visible glory was seen by the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>). St. Paul uses a similar phrase, "The Lord of glory '(<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). Our father. He thus identifies himself with his judges, whom he had just called "brethren." In <span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia</span>, which would be in Hebrew "Aram of the two rivers." The exact place, as we learn from <a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, was "Ur of the Chaldees;" whence the Israelites were taught to say (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), "An Aramcan ready to perish was my father." That this appearance was in Ur, <span class="cmt_word">before he dwelt in Haran</span>, is manifest from <a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, because it is there said that they went forth from Ur "to go into the land of Canaan," which makes it quite certain that the appearance of God to Abraham had preceded their leaving Ur, and was the cause of it. And this is confirmed by <a href="../../par/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; and Josephus ('Ant.,' 1. 7:1). Moreover, the very language of the call shows plainly that it came to him when he was living in his native country, among his kindred, and in his father's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at Ur, not in Haran, where they were only sojourners. There is nothing the least unusual, in Hebrew narrative, in the writer going back to any point in the preceding narrative with which the subsequent narrative is connected. <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. I precedes in point of time <a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>; similar examples are <a href="../../par/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a> compared with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20, 21</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>; and many more. It is, however, of course possible that a fresh call may have been given after Terah's death, though it is by no means necessary to suppose it. Another imaginary difficulty arises from the statement in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a> that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran, that Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and that Terah died at the age of two hundred and five; and from the statement in ver. 4 of this chapter that Abram did not leave Haran till Terah's death. From which it is concluded that Terah must have lived sixty years after Abram's departure (70 + 75 + 60   =   205). But the whole difficulty arises from the gratuitous supposition that Abram was Terah's firstborn because he is named first. If Terah were a hundred and thirty at the birth of Abram, he would be two hundred and five when Abram was seventy-five. Now, there is absolutely nothing to forbid the supposition that such was his age. It does not follow that because Abram is named first he was the eldest. He might be named first as being by far the most illustrious of the three, he might be named first because the subsequent genealogies - Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs - were deduced from him. There may, too, have been other sons of Terah, not named here because nothing was going to be said about them. Nahor is mentioned because Rebekah was his granddaughter (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15, 24</a>) and Rachel his great-granddaughter. And Haran is mentioned because he was the father of Lot. Others, whether sons or daughters, would not be mentioned. If Terah, therefore, began to have children when he was seventy, it is quite probable that Abram may not have been born till he was a hundred and thirty. That the son named first need not necessarily be the eldest is clear from the order in which Shem, Ham, and Japheth are named, whereas it appears from <a href="../../par/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a> that Ham was the youngest, and from <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2, 21</a> (according to the A.V. and the LXX., Symmachus, the Targum of Onkelos, and the old Jewish commentators), that Japheth was the eldest. In <a href="../../par/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a> God says, "I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau," though Esau was the elder; and so <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>. So again in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20</a> we read, "Moses and Aaron" (see also <a href="../../par/exodus/40-31.htm">Exodus 40:31</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-43.htm">Numbers 16:43</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-5.htm">Joshua 24:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>; etc.), though it appears from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-3.htm">1 Chronicles 6:3</a> that Aaron was the eldest. So again we read in <a href="../../par/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, "Thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh," and in ver. 20, "God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh," though in ver. I of the same chapter they are named according to the true order of birth - "Manasseh and Ephraim." It is, therefore, an unwarrantable inference that Abram was the eldest son because he is named first; and with the removal of this inference the difficulty vanishes; and Stephen was quite accurate when he said that God appeared to Abraham in Ur, before he dwelt in Haran, and that he did not move from Haran till the death of Terah. <span class="cmt_word">Haran</span>. <span class="accented">Charran</span> in A.V. marks the difference between <span class="accented">Haran</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>), Lot's father, and the name of the place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). It is called "the city of Nahor" (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> compared with Genesis 47:43). It still exists as an Arab village, with the name of Harran (see 'Dictionary of Bible').

And this sojourning as strangers and pilgrims lasted altogether four hundred and thirty years, vie. two hundred and fifteen years in Canaan, and two hundred and fifteen in Egypt; which agrees exactly with St. Paul's reckoning in round numbers of four hundred years from the giving of the promise to Abraham to the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>).

Moreover, the accuracy of the number is tested in two ways. First, the names of the sons and daughters of each patriarch are given, and they are found, on counting them, to amount to exactly seventy. And then the totals of the descendants of each of Jacob's four wives is given separately, and again the total is exactly seventy (33 + 16 + 14 + 7   =   70). It is true that the computation in ver. 26 does not agree with the above, for it makes the number of Jacob's descendants, exclusive of Joseph and his two sons, sixty-six instead of sixty-seven, which is the number according to the two above computations, and consequently the total number (when Joseph and his two sons are added) sixty-nine instead of seventy. But this is such a manifest contradiction that it seems almost a necessity to suppose a clerical error, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, caused perhaps by the preceding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. It is also a singular anomaly that, in the enumeration of Leah's descendants, as well as in the general enumeration, Er and Onan are distinctly reckoned as well as <span class="accented">mentioned</span>. Jacob himself is nowhere reckoned in the Bible, though he is in the commentaries. But when we turn to the LXX., we find that in <a href="../../par/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a> there are added to Manasseh and Ephraim Machir the son and Gilead the grandson of Manasseh; and Suthelah and Taam the sons, and Edom (meaning Eran, <span class="accented">LXX.</span> Eden, <a href="../../par/numbers/26-36.htm">Numbers 26:36</a>) the grandson, of Ephraim, making the descendants of Rachel eighteen (it should be nineteen if <span class="accented">Huppim</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, is added) instead of fourteen; the number sixty-six of ver. 26 is preserved; the number of Joseph's descendants is given as nine (Huppim apparently being now reckoned), which, added to sixty-six, makes seventy-five; and accordingly in ver. 27 the LXX. read <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("seventy-five souls"), instead of "three score and <span class="accented">ten."</span> But except in the addition of these five names of Joseph's grand and great-grand-children, the LXX. support the Hebrew text, even in the strange <span class="accented">sixty-six</span> of ver. 26. Stephen, as a Hellenist, naturally follows the LXX. But the question arises - How are we to understand the lists? <a href="../../par/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a> says, "These are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;" and one naturally expects to find the names only of those who are described in vers. 5-7 as the migratory party from Canaan to Egypt. This expectation is somewhat disturbed by Er and Onan being included in the enumeration. This may, however, be accounted for by Pharez and Zerah being reckoned as their seed. But is it likely that Hezron and Hamul the sons of Pharez, and the other great-grandsons of Jacob, were born before the descent into Egypt? The answer to this is that, as Jacob was a hundred and thirty years old when he came down to Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/47-28.htm">Genesis 47:28</a>), there is no improbability in his having great-grandchildren (allowing forty years for a generation); on the contrary, every likelihood that he should. But on the other hand, as Joseph could not have been above fifty when Jacob came down to Egypt (30 + 14 + X.), <a href="../../par/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46, 29, 30</a>, it does not seem likely or possible that Joseph should have had grown-up grandsons and a great-grandson, as the LXX. make him have. Indeed, to all appearance Manasseh and Ephraim were unmarried young men at the time that Jacob blessed them (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-11.htm">Genesis 48:11, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). Therefore we may conclude certainly that the additional numbers of the LXX. are incorrect, if understood literally, of these who came down with Jacob from Canaan to Egypt. But there is nothing improbable in Benjamin having ten children. Judah, to whom grandchildren are attributed, was Jacob's fourth son, and might be forty or fifty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Asher, to whom also grandsons are attributed, was the eighth son, and might be twenty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Still, considering that Er and Onan are reckoned among those who came down to Egypt, it would not be surprising to find that some of those mentioned in the list were born after Jacob's arrival, but included on some principle which we do not understand. In other words, a literal interpretation of the statement of the Hebrew Bible involves no impossibilities, but a literal interpretation of the statement of the LXX. does.

(Hebrew for Greek form); <span class="accented">in Shechem</span> for <span class="accented">the father of Sychem</span>, A.V. and T.R. As regards the statement in the text, two distinct transactions seem at first sight to be mixed up. One, that Abraham bought the field of Machpelah of Ephron the Hittite for a burial-place, where he and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah, were buried (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16, 17, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>); the other, that Jacob "bought a parcel of a field..., at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money," where the bones of Joseph were buried by Joshua (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>), and where, according to a tradition still surviving in the days of St. Jerome, the other patriarchs were also buried ('Epistol.'86," She came to Sichem, now called Neapolis (or Nablous), and from thence visited the tombs of the twelve patriarchs"). See also Jerome, 'De Optimo Genere Interpretandi. All Jewish writers, however, are wholly silent" about this tradition, perhaps from jealousy of the Samaritans (Lightfoot, vol. 8. p. 423). And Josephus affirms that all but Joseph were buried at Hebron ('Ant. Jud.,'2. 8:2); and that their beautiful marble monuments were to be seen at Hebron in his day. In the cave of Machpelah, however, there is no tomb of any of the twelve patriarchs except Joseph; and his so-called tomb is of a different character and situation from the genuine ones (Stanley's 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' 1st series, pp. 498-500. See also 'Sermons in the East': 'The Mosque of Hebron'). But on looking closer at the text it appears pretty certain that only Shechem was in Stephen's mind. For first he speaks of Shechem at once, <span class="cmt_word">And were carried over unto Shechem</span>. And adds and <span class="cmt_word">were laid in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> Except the one word "Abraham," the whole sentence points to Shechem. What he says of Shechem is exactly in accordance with <a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18, 19</a>. And what he says of their fathers being carried over and buried at Shechem is exactly true of Joseph's bones, as related in <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>. So that the one difficulty is the word "Abraham." It seems much more probable that this word should have been interpolated by some early transcriber, who saw no nominative case to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and who had in his mind a confused recollection of Abraham's purchase, than that Stephen, who shows such thorough knowledge of the Bible history, should have made a gross mistake in such a well-known and famous circumstance as the purchase of the field of Machpelah, or that Luke should have perpetuated it had he made it in the hurry of speech. It cannot be affirmed with certainty that Stephen confirms the story of the other patriarchs being buried at Shechem, though possibly he alludes to the tradition. The plural, "they were carried," etc., might be put generally, though only Joseph was meant (as <a href="../../par/matthew/27-44.htm">Matthew 27:44</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a> compared with <a href="../../par/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>), or "the bones of Joseph" might possibly be the subject, though not expressed. Lightfoot - followed by Bishop Wordsworth, who thinks that Abraham really did buy a field of Ephron in Sychem, when he was there (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>)-would thus be right in supposing that the point of Stephen's remark was that the patriarchs were buried in Shechem.

In Stephen's time it could hardly have become widely known as the designation of the flock of Christ. On the whole, the marginal rendering, "the congregation," seems best, but with the idea attached that it was the Lord's congregation. <span class="cmt_word">The angel which spake</span>. It may be doubted whether the phrase, "the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai," refers to the angel spoken of in ver. 30, or to the angel by whose mouth God spake the words of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, as recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1-22</a>. Chrysostom and most commentators seem to understand it of the angel who gave the Law; but Whitby, not without reason, thinks the reference is to the burning bush. <span class="cmt_word">Living oracles</span>. In like manner, St. Paul calls the Holy Scriptures "the oracles of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), and in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a> we read again of "the first principles of the oracles of God," and St. Peter says, "Let him speak as the oracles of God" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>).

This, according to Lightfoot, with whom most commentators agree, was in accordance with a very common practice of readers in the schools and pulpits of the Jews, to adapt and accommodate a text to their own immediate purpose, keeping, however, to historical truth. Here Stephen points to the Babylonish Captivity as the punishment of the sins of their fathers, thus warning them of more terrible judgments to follow their rejection of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for yea, A.V.; the <span class="accented">god Rephan</span> for <span class="accented">your god Remphan</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the figures</span> for <span class="accented">figures</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The god Rephan</span>. Rephan, or Raiphan, or Remphan, as it is variously written, is the LXX. translation of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Chiun</span> in <a href="../../par/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>. The best explanation of this is that Rephan is the Coptic name of the planet Saturn, well-known of course to the LXX., and that Chiun is the Hebrew and Arabic name of the same star, which they therefore translated by Rephan. With regard to the difficulty which has been felt by many <span class="accented">that</span> there is no mention of any such worship of Moloch and Chiun in the wilderness, and that sacrifices were continually offered to the Lord, it seems to arise from an entire misconception of the passage in Amos. What Amos means to say is that because of the treacherous, unfaithful heart of Israel, as shown in the worship of the golden calf and all their rebellions in the wilderness, all their sacrifices were worthless. Just as he had said in <a href="../../par/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, "Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts;" "I hate, I despise your feast days; Take away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols" (<a href="../../par/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21, 23</a>): just as Isaiah also says, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?... I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts ... Bring no more vain oblations; ... it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>, etc.); and again, "He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>): so all the sacrifices offered up during forty years in the wilderness were no sacrifices at all, and their hypocrisy was clearly seen when they reached the land of Canaan, and, according to Moses' prophetic declaration, "forsook God which made them...  aria sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-18</a>), such as Chiun and Moloch, Baalim and Ashtoreth. This later idolatry was the fruit and the judicial punishment of their first declension and apostasy in the wilderness, and led to the Captivity in Babylon. It was on seeing their unfaithfulness in the wilderness that" God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven."

So here they received the Law "at" or "on the occasion of," the "ordering" or "appointing" of angels.

Another sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> - "in view of" - comes to nearly the same thing.

He says of it, that it was "ordained through ['by,' A V] angels" God ordained or appointed the Law, but the angels were the instruments or ministers of its promulgation. And it is also distinctly referred to in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, where the LXX. read, "On his right hand the angels were with him." In the foregoing verses the application which Stephen had all through been contemplating is hurled with accumulated force at the consciences of his hearers, and cuts them to the heart, but does not bring them to repentance.

The glory of God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the visible glory which surrounds and proclaims God's near presence (see <a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10, 16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14, 23</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus standing.</span> Sitting at the right hand of God is the usual attitude ascribed to our Lord in token of his victorious rest, and waiting for the day of judgment. Here he is seen standing, as rising to welcome his faithful martyr, and to place on his head the crown of life <a href="../../par/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). Whether Stephen saw these glorious things in the flesh or out of the flesh he probably knew not himself.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a></div><div class="verse">And cast <i>him</i> out of the city, and stoned <i>him</i>: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - <span class="accented">They cast</span> for <span class="accented">cast</span>, A.V. ; <span class="accented">garments</span> for <span class="accented">clothes</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the feet of a young man</span> for <span class="accented">a young man's feet</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">named Saul</span> for <span class="accented">whose name was Saul</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They cast</span>. We have here the identical phrase of <a href="../../par/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>. The witness. According to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>, "the hands of the witnesses were to be first upon" the idolater "to put him to death." They took off their clothes, their outer garments, so as to be free to hurl the stones at their victim with greater force. <span class="cmt_word">The feet of a young man</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is found only here and in <a href="../../par/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-17.htm">Acts 23:17, 18, 22</a>; and frequently in the LXX. for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span>. A man might be called a <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> probably to the age of thirty. This appearance of Saul upon the stage of St. Luke's narrative is an element which will soon change the whole current of the narrative, and divert it from Jerusalem to the whole earth. Nothing can be more striking than this introduction of the young man Saul to our view as an accomplice (albeit "ignorantly in unbelief") in the martyrdom of Stephen. Who that stood there and saw him keeping the clothes of the witnesses would have imagined that he would become the foremost apostle of the faith which he sought to destroy from off the face of the earth?

The A.V. is certainly not justified by the context, because the words which follow, "Lord Jesus," show to whom the invocation was made, even to him whom he saw standing at the right hand of God. At the same time, the request, <span class="cmt_word">Receive my spirit</span>, was a striking acknowledgment of the divinity of Christ. Only he who gave the spirit could receive it back again, and keep it safe unto the resurrection. Compare "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>).

"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord,... that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them." St. Augustine ('Sermons in Festo Sti.
