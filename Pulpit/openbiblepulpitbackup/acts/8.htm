The doubt arises from Josephus stating <span class="accented">that</span> Simon to be a Cypriot (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), whereas Justin Martyr says of Simon Magus that he was <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a native of Gitton, or Githon, a village of Samaria. It has been thought that Gitton may be a mistake of Justin's for Citium, in Cyprus (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 260, 352; Alford, etc.). The after history of Simon Magus is full of fable. He is spoken of by Irenaeus and other early writers as the inventor or founder of heresy. (For a list of authorities concerning Simon, see Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 260, note; Alford, 1:6; 'Bible Dictionary; 'and a good article in 'Dict. of Biog. and Mythol.')

In Simon we have the first example of one who, having been baptized into Jesus Christ, lived to disgrace and corrupt the faith which he professed. He was an instance of the tares sown among the wheat, and of the seed which sprang up quickly being as quickly destroyed. He is an instance also of the truth of our Lord's raying, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The apostles</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">They sent unto them Peter and John</span>. The selection of these two chief apostles shows the great importance attached to the conversion of the Samaritans. The joint act of the college of apostles in sending them demonstrates that Peter was not a pope, but a brother apostle, albeit their primate; and that the government of the Church was in the apostolate, not in one of the number. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/8-15.htm">Acts 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they might receive the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Holy Ghost.</span> Why was it needful that two apostles should come down to Samaria and pray, with laying on of hands, for the newly baptized that they might receive the Holy Ghost? There is no mention of such prayer or such imposition of hands in the case of the first three thousand who were baptized. They were told by St. Peter, "Be baptized every one of you, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>), and they were baptized, and doubtless did receive the Holy Ghost, Neither is there any mention of such things in the case of the subsequent thousands who were baptized at Jerusalem on the apostles' preaching. Why, then, was it so in Samaria? To answer this question, we must observe the difference in the circumstances. The baptisms at Jerusalem were performed by the apostles themselves. The Holy Ghost was given upon their promise and assurance. But in Samaria the preaching and the baptizing were done by the scattered disciples. There was a danger of many independent bodies springing up, owing no allegiance to the apostles, and cemented by no bonds to the mother Church. But Christ's Church was to be one - many members, but one body. The apostolate was to be the governing power of the whole Church, by the will and ordinance of Christ. Hence there was a manifest reason why, when the gospel spread beyond Judaea, these visible spiritual gifts should be given only through the laying on of the apostles' hands, and by the intervention of their prayers. This had a manifest and striking influence in marking and preserving the unity of the Church, and in marking and maintaining the sovereignty of the apostolic rule. For precisely the same reason has the Catholic and Apostolic Church in all ages (<a href="../../par/acts/19-5.htm">Acts 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-2.htm">Hebrews 6:2</a>) maintained the rite of confirmation, "after the example of the holy apostles." Besides the other great benefits connected with it, its influence in binding up in the unity of the Church the numerous parishes of the diocese, instead of letting them become independent congregations, is very great. Observe, too, how prayer and the laying on of hands are tied together. Neither is valid without the other. In this case, as at Pentecost, the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred. In confirmation, now that miracles have ceased, it is the ordinary and invisible grace of the Holy Spirit that is to be looked for.

But as baptism was preceded by a confession of faith similar to that in our own Baptismal Service, so it was a true description to speak of baptism as being in the Name of Jesus Christ.

The context there also shows conclusively that the "gall and bitterness" ("wormwood," A.V.) of which Moses speaks is the spirit of idolatry or defection from God springing up in some professing member of the Church, and defiling and corrupting others, as it is expounded in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15, 16</a>. This, as St. Peter saw, was exactly the case with Simon, whose heart was not straight with God, but "had turned away from him," as it is said in Deuteronomy. Though baptized, he was still an idolater in heart, and likely to trouble many. "The gall of bitterness" is the same as "gall and wormwood," or "bitterness." "Gall," or "bile," is in classical Greek and other languages a synonym for "bitterness," especially in a figurative sense (see <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15, 19</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, LXX.).

That district, he is reminded, was desert, part, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, or the desert of Judaea.

But on the other hand, Irenaeus, in the third book against Heresies, <a href="../../par/acts/12-8.htm">Acts 12:8</a>, distinctly quotes a portion of this verse. The eunuch, he says, when he asked to be baptized said, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: and Cyprian, in his third book of Testimonies, 43, quotes the other part of the verse. In proof of the thesis that "whoever believes may be immediately baptized," he <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">In</span> the Acts of the Apostles [when the eunuch said], Behold water, what doth hinder me to be baptized? Philip answered, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest." So that in the second and third centuries, long anterior to the oldest existing manuscripts, this entire verse must have been found in the codices both of the Greek and Latin Churches. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/8-38.htm">Acts 8:38</a></div><div class="verse">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Both went down</span> for <span class="accented">went down both</span>, A.V. Nothing can be more graphic than the simple narrative of this interesting and important baptism. Surely Luke must have heard it from Philip's own mouth (see <a href="../../par/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8-10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> <span class="accented">- Came up</span> for <span class="accented">were come up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and the eunuch</span> for <span class="accented">that the eunuch</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">for he went</span> for <span class="accented">and he went</span>, A.V. The eunuch made no attempt to follow Philip, but went on his road to Egypt, his whole heart filled with the new joy of Christ's salvation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a></div><div class="verse">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - He <span class="accented">preached the gospel to all the cities</span> for <span class="accented">he preached in all the cities</span>, A.V. The sudden rapture of Philip by the Spirit, and his transportation to Azotus, or Ashdod, reminds us forcibly of <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>, and of the successive journeys of Elijah just prior to his translation. In Philip's case we may suppose a kind of trance, which was not ended till he found himself at Azotus. <span class="cmt_word">Passing through</span>. For <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (there rendered "went about"), see ver. 4, note. To Caesarea; where we find him domiciled (<a href="../../par/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>). Such coincidences, appearing in the narrative without any explanation, are strong marks of truth. "He journeyed northward from Ashdod, perhaps through Ekron, Ramah, Joppa, and the plain of Sharon" (Meyer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
