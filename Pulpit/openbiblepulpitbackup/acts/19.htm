The R.V. gives the sense much more accurately than the A.V., which is, "Did ye receive the Holy Ghost at the time of your baptism, when ye first believed?" Something led the apostle to suspect that they had not received the seal of the Spirit (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), and so he asked the question. The answer, <span class="cmt_word">Nay, we did, not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given</span>, as in the R.V., is justified by <a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>, where the exactly similar phrase, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is rendered in the A.V., "The Holy Spirit was not yet given." "<span class="accented">Esse</span> pro <span class="accented">adesse"</span> (Bengel). The sense given in the A.V. does not seem probable. The answer means, "Not only have we not received the Holy Spirit, but we had not even heard that the dispensation of the Spirit was Come."

Nothing can mark more strongly the connection between baptism and the reception of the Holy Spirit than this question does. For it implies, "How could you be ignorant of the giving of the Holy Ghost if you were duly baptized?" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>) The answer explains it, "We were baptized with John's baptism, to which no promise of the gift of the Holy Ghost was attached."

But the candidate always first made a profession of his faith in Jesus Christ, as in the A.V. of <a href="../../par/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a>; and the effect of baptism was an incorporation into Christ so as to partake of his death unto sin and his life unto righteousness. It was, therefore, a true and compendious description of baptism, to speak of it as a baptism in (or into) the Name of Jesus Christ. (See the Baptismal Service in the Book of Common Prayer.)

It might well be the Divine purpose, in the case of both Peter and Paul, to invest with such extraordinary power the very persons of the apostles who were to stand forth as his messengers and preach in his Name. In St. Paul this parity of miraculous energy stamped his apostleship with an authority equal to that of St. Peter.

The words should be construed together, "<span class="accented">strolling</span> Jewish exorcists." That certain Jews in our Savior's time exorcised evil spirits appears from <a href="../../par/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49</a>. We learn also from Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 8:2, 5, that forms of exorcism, said to have been invented by King Solomon, so efficacious that the devils cast out by them could never come back, were used with great effect in his days. He adds that he himself knew of an instance in which one of his own countrymen, Eleazar by name, had cast out devils in the presence of Vespasian and his <span class="accented">sons</span> and officers and a number of his soldiers. The method used was this: The exorcist applied to the nose of the possessed the bezil of a ring, under which was a certain root prescribed by Solomon, and so drew out the evil spirit through the man's nostrils. The possessed then fell to the ground, and the exorcist commanded the evil spirit in the name of Solomon never to return, and then recited one of Solomon's incantations. To give full assurance to the bystanders that the evil spirit had really left the man, the exorcist placed a vessel full of water at some distance off, and then commanded the ejected spirit to overturn it, which he did. Thus far Josephus. Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>. (vol. 3:215), quotes the book Juchasin as speaking of certain Jews as "skilled in miracles," and the Jerusalem Talmud as speaking of their enchantments and magical tricks and charms" in the name of Jesus" (see, further, Alford on <a href="../../par/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>).

Comp. <a href="../../par/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11-14</a>, where the same effects are ascribed to the death of Ananias and Sapphire and the signs and wonders which were wrought by the apostles at that time. This fear produced by the putting forth of God's power paralyzed for a time the enemies of the gospel, and enabled believers, as it were, to take possession of their new heritage, just as the miracles at the Red Sea and the destruction of Sihon and Og paralyzed the courage of the Canaanites and enabled the Israelites to take possession of their land (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). With respect to the incident which caused this fear, it might at first seem inconsistent with our Lord's saying to the apostles (<a href="../../par/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49, 50</a>). But the cases were very different. He who cast out devils in the name of Jesus, in the Gospel, does not seem to have had any hostility to the faith, for our Lord speaks of him as one who "is not against us." But these sons of Sceva were among the unbelieving Jews who were "hardened and disobedient;" and if their exorcisms had been permitted to succeed, they would have had power to withstand Paul, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and the very purpose for which miraculous power was given to St. Paul would have been frustrated. There- fore they were discomfited, and the subtle design of Satan to destroy, while seeming to magnify, the Name of Jesus was signally defeated. Comp. the somewhat similar incident at Philippi (<a href="../../par/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>). Justin Martyr, in his 'Diologue with Trypho,' quoted by Alford on <a href="../../par/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>, speaks of the Jews as exorcising, sometimes in the name of kings (referring, doubtless, to Solomon), sometimes of just men, or of prophets, or of patriarchs. So these men took up the name of Jesus.

This and the following verse speak of that class of converts who had previously been addicted to magic arts.

He has but just won Ephesus and Asia, and already he undertakes Macedonia and Achaia.

Silos, who had been Timothy's companion on the former visit to Macedonia, seems to have left St. Paul, possibly at Jerusalem, from whence he originally came (<a href="../../par/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32, 34</a>), and to have attached himself to Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Perhaps he was especially connected with the mission to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, etc., as it appears from the passage just quoted that he was "a faithful brother unto them," A.V.; "or our faithful brother," R.V. <span class="cmt_word">He himself stayed</span>, etc. This phrase is in singular harmony with <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>, which seems clearly to have been written after Timothy's departure for Macedonia and before his arrival at Corinth, since Timothy is not mentioned either in the superscription or among the salutations (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19, 20</a>), and his coming to Corinth is spoken of as doubtful, though probable, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. Both passages imply a prolongation of Paul's stay at Ephesus beyond his original intention. The special reason for this prolongation of his sojourn at Ephesus, and which is alluded to in 1 Car 16:9, is thought to be the Artemisian or Ephesian games, which were celebrated at Ephesus in May - and therefore just at this time - and which brought a vast concourse of Ionians to Ephesus. It was at this time, doubtless, that the principal sale of "silver shrines of Diana" took place, and therefore it was natural that Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen should be very angry when they found their usual gains were cut short by the multitude of converts all over Proconsular Asia. We learn from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a> that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus had arrived at Ephesus from Corinth. It is likely that their presence, together with that of Tychicus and Trophimus, two Asiatic converts, enabled St. Paul to dispense with the services of Time-thy and Erastus for a time. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, kept himself back, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> stayed; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a while, an indefinite phrase, but indicating a short time.

The common place of resort for all great meetings. So Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 2:80 (quoted by Alford), says that at Antioch the people were wont to hold their public debates in the theatre, and that a crowded meeting was held there to forward the interests of Vespasian, then aspiring to the empire. So Josephus speaks of the people of Antioch holding a public assembly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in the theatre ('Bell. Jud.,' 7. 3:3). The people of the Greek city of Tarentum received the ambassadors from Rome in the theatre, "according to the Greek custom," Val. Max., 2:2, 5 (Kuinoel, on <a href="../../par/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>). The theatre at Ephesus, of which "ruins of immense grandeur" still remain, is said to be the largest of which we have any account (Howson, 2. p. 68). <span class="cmt_word">Having seized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); a favorite word with Luke(<a href="../../par/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>); and found also in the LXX, of <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; 2 Macc. 3:27 2Macc. 4:41; but not elsewhere in the New Testament. It is a common medical word of sudden seizures. The force of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> is that they hurried Gaius and Aristarchus along with them to the theatre, no doubt intending there to accuse them to the people. <span class="cmt_word">Gaius and Aristarchus</span>. In <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> there is mention of a certain <span class="accented">Gains</span> who was one of Paul's companions in travel, but who is described as "of Derbe." Again in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a> a Gains is mentioned as one of St. Paul's converts on his first visit to Corinth, whom he baptized himself; and in <a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a> (written from Corinth) we have mention of Gains as St. Paul's host, and of the whole Church, likely, therefore, to be the same person. Then we have the Gains to whom St. John's Third Epistle is addressed, and whose hospitality to the brethren was a conspicuous feature in his character, and one tending to identify him with the Gaius of <a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>. We seem, therefore, to have, in immediate connection with St, Paul, Gaius of Corinth, Gains of Macedonia, and Gains of Derbe. But Gaius (or Caius, as it is written in Latin) was such a common name, and the Jews so often shifted their residence from one city to another, that it is not safe either to infer identity from identity of name, or diversity from diversity of description. <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span>, here described as of <span class="cmt_word">Macedonia</span>, is more precisely spoken of in <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> as a Thessalonian. In <a href="../../par/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>, where we find him accompanying St. Paul from Caesarea to Rome, he is described as "a Macedonian of Thessalonica." In <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> he is St. Paul's "fellow-prisoner,' as voluntarily sharing his prison (Alford, on <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>), and in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> he is his fellow-laborer. His history, therefore, is that, having been converted on St Paul's visit to Thessalonica, he attached himself to him as one of his missionary staff, and continued with him through good report and evil report, through persecution, violence, imprisonment, shipwreck, and bonds, to the latest moment on which the light of Bible history shines. Blessed servant of Christ! blessed fellow-servant of his chief apostle!

It seems likely that, as St. Paul's offence was speaking against the gods and their temples, the Jews, who were commonly accused of being atheists, and one of whose nation Paul was, came in for their share of the popular odium. They were anxious, therefore, to excuse themselves before the people of having had any share in St. Paul's work, and put forward Alexander, no doubt a clever man and a good speaker, to make their defense. But as soon as the people knew that he was a Jew, they refused to listen to him, and drowned his voice with incessant shouts of "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."

The word <span class="accented">Neoceros</span> was a peculiar title, assumed first by persons and then by such cities, in Asia especially, as had the special charge of the temple and sacred rites of any particular god. It first appears on coins of Ephesus, in the reign of Nero, and was deemed a title of great honor. One inscription speaks of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as making a certain dedication. But another use of the term sprang up about this time. Among the vile flatteries of those corrupt times, it became usual with cities to dedicate temples and altars to the emperors, and they received in return the title, meant to be an honor, of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the emperor. Some extant coins exhibit the city of Ephesus as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> both of Diana and the emperor (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 411; Howson, vol. it. pp. 75, 76). <span class="cmt_word">The image which fell down from Jupiter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the 'Iphig. in Taur.,' 947), <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; which is described in ver. 88 of the same play as "the image (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the goddess Diana, which they say fell down from heaven (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) into her temple in Tauris;" and in line 1349 it is called <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> image of the daughter of Jove which fell from heaven," brought away from Tauris by Iphigenia and Orestes into Attica. But it does not appear that there was any tradition that the identical image brought from Tauris was carried to Ephesus. There are several representations of the Ephesian Diana, or Artemis, on coins, of which one or two are given by Lewin (vol. 1. p, 411) and by Howson (vol. it. p. 66). The image was of rude form and execution, mummy-shaped, or like an inverted pyramid; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span> (rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">multi-mammia</span>, and explained as intending to represent her as the nourisher of all living things: Preface to Ephesians); made of wood variously described as ebony, cedar, and vine wood. Pliny says that, though the temple itself had been restored seven times, the image had never been altered (quoted by Kuinoel).

It appears also that St. Paul had not launched out into abuse of the heathen gods in general, or Diana in particular, but had preached the more excellent way by faith in Jesus Christ, to draw them from their idols (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>).

With regard to the great tumult to which the foregoing narrative relates, it is certain that St. Luke has by no means exaggerated its importance. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after his departure from Ephesus, St. Paul speaks as one still smarting under the severity of his sufferings. In the language of trust, yet of a trust sorely tried, he speaks of the Father of mercies" who comforteth us in all our tribulation." He speaks of the sufferings of Christ as abounding in him. And then, referring directly to the trouble which came upon him in Asia, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-10</a>). And the same tone breaks out again in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>. It is also very probable that it was on this occasion that Priscilla and Aquila saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own, to which he alludes in <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>, written after he had reached Corinth from Macedonia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before Easter of the year  So that it is certain that the riot and the danger to St. Paul's life were even greater than we should have inferred from St. Luke's narrative alone. It should be added, with reference to the three <span class="accented">years</span> residence at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>) which this nineteenth chapter describes, that one or two important incidents which occurred are not related by St. Luke. The first is that encounter with a savage rabble to which St. Paul refers in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>, but of which we have no account in the Acts. It must have happened in the early part of his sojourn at Ephesus. Another is a probable visit to Corinth, inferred from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1, 2</a>; and thought to have been caused by bad accounts of the moral state of the Corinthian Church, sent to him at Ephesus. It was probably a hasty visit, and in contrast with it he says, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>, with reference to his then coming visit, "I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you." It is also thought that there was another letter to the Corinthians, written from Ephesus, soon after that second visit, which is now lost, but is alluded to in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was manifestly written at this time from Ephesus (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 19</a>). Some think that the Epistle to the Galatians was also written from Ephesus, a little before the First Epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>); but Renan thinks it was written from Antioch, before he came to Ephesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
