As we saw on 1 Samuel 4:1, this word, signifying a <span class="accented">fortress</span>, is a very common name for places. If it was the Aphek in Judah there mentioned, David's dismissal would have taken place near Gath, and so soon after Achish joined the Philistine army. Mr. Conder thinks it was the place represented by the modern village <span class="accented">Fuku'a</span>, near Mount Gilboa, in the tribe of Issachar; but as this was distant from Ziklag eighty or ninety miles, it would not have been possible for David to have reached home thence on the third day (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), nor was it probable that his presence with his little army would remain long unnoticed. <span class="cmt_word">A fountain which is in Jezreel.</span> Hebrew, "the fountain." Conder says, "Crossing the valley we see before us the site of Jezreel, on a knoll 500 feet high. The position is very peculiar, for whilst on the north and northeast the slopes are steep and rugged, on the south the ascent is very gradual, and the traveller coming northward is astonished to look down suddenly on the valley with its two springs: one, 'Ain Jalud, welling out from a conglomerate cliff, and forming a pool 100 yards long with muddy borders; the other, the Crusaders' fountain of Tubania" ('Tent-Work,' 1:124). The former is the fountain mentioned here; and it is evident that even now Saul had chosen a strong position for his army. The reading of the Septuagint, <span class="accented">En-dor</span> instead of "the fountain" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">En</span>, or <span class="accented">Ain</span>), is indefensible, as the Israelites were many miles to the southward.

Achish answers that these men were the followers of David, who, having deserted from Saul, had been with him <span class="cmt_word">these days or these years</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an indefinitely long time, during which he had conducted himself with the utmost fidelity to his new master.

As a proper name it has the article, as in the books of Job and Zechariah. <span class="cmt_word">Should he reconcile himself.</span> The verb means, "to make himself pleasing," "to commend himself." <span class="cmt_word">The heads of these men,</span> pointing to the Philistine ranks. <span class="cmt_word">David of whom they sang,</span> etc. The song of the Jewish maidens seems to have been as well known in Philistia as in the land of Israel On the former occasion it had made the Philistines drive him away from the court of Achish (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-11.htm">1 Samuel 21:11-15</a>); here, too, it made them drive him from their army, but he was thereby saved from the painful necessity of making war on his own country, and returned just in time to rescue his wives and property. ACHISH SENDS DAVID AWAY (vers. 6-11). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-5.htm">1 Samuel 29:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, <i>as</i> the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host <i>is</i> good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As Jehovah liveth.</span> These words are strange in the mouth of a Philistine, nor can we suppose that out of respect to David he would thus swear by David's God. Probably they are the equivalent of the oath which Achish really used. He sends, however, David away with the utmost courtesy, assuring him that his own wish had been that he should remain with him, because all his conduct had been upright since he had come to him at Gath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-7.htm">1 Samuel 29:7</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</div><div class="comm">

But truth is a modern virtue, and though David extols it in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/15-2.htm">Psalm 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>), we too often find him practising falsehood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-9.htm">1 Samuel 29:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou <i>art</i> good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1 know that,</span> etc. Rather, "I know it, for thou art good in my sight," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 1 know all that thou wouldst say as to thy trustworthiness, and assent to it. <span class="cmt_word">As an angel of God.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> as a messenger of God, as one set to me by God.

It has been well remarked that while this would be a strange description of David's own men, it would exactly describe that band of deserters belonging to the tribe of Manasseh who, instead of obeying Saul's summons to the war with the Philistines, joined David about this time (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As soon as ye be up early in the morning,</span> etc. If it was on the second day s march that the Philistine lords objected to David's continuance with them, he would be back at Gath in two days, and on the third day reach Ziklag, as is said in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>. However difficult David's position may have been, still every one must condemn his conduct towards Achish as dishonourable; but God, who often deals with men more mercifully than they deserve, nevertheless rescued him from his state of perplexity, and saved him from the necessity of either fighting against his own countrymen or of still more dishonourably breaking his word to Achish by deserting in the battle. He also sent him home just in time to rescue from a miserable fate those whom he loved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
