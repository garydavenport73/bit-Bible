The Hebrew is elliptical, "A wise son, his father's discipline," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is the object or the result of his father's education; he owes his wisdom to it. Septuagint, "A clever (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) son is obedient to his father." <span class="cmt_word">But a scorner</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>) <span class="cmt_word">heareth not rebuke;</span> one who mocks at goodness and despises filial piety will not listen to reproof. Septuagint, "A disobedient son is in destruction." Compare the case of Eli's sons, and their fate (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-25.htm">1 Samuel 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17</a>).

By his kindly speech and wise counsels he shall gain the good will of his neighbours and the blessing of God. Schultens observes that the word rendered "good" (<span class="accented">tob</span>) means what is pleasant to taste and smell, while that translated "violence" (<span class="accented">chamas</span>) signifies literally what is crude and unripe. <span class="cmt_word">The soul of the transgressors shall eat violence</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>). The Authorized Version introduces the verb from the first clause unnecessarily. The meaning of this rendering is that sinners, especially the treacherous, bring on themselves retribution; the injuries which they devise against others recoil on their own heads (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-6.htm">Proverbs 10:6</a>). The Hebrew is, "The soul (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the desire, or delight) of the perfidious (is) violence." Such men have only one thing at heart, viz. to wrong their neighbour, and to increase their own property by any, even nefarious, precedings. Septuagint, "Of the fruits of righteousness the good man shall eat; but the lives of transgressors shall perish untimely."

But <span class="cmt_word">he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>). The Vulgate paraphrases, "He who is inconsiderate in speech shall experience evils;" Septuagint, "will terrify himself" - will occasion to himself many terrible alarms and inflictions. Hence the psalmist prays, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my month; keep the door of my lips." So we have in the Danish, "A silent man's words are not brought into court;" and in the Spanish, "Let not the tongue say what the head shall pay for;" while the Italians tell us, "The sheep that bleats is strangled by the wolf:" and "Silence was never written down" (Kelly). (See on Proverbs 18:6; 20:19.)

He has the wish, but not the will, and the empty wish without corresponding exertion is useless (<a href="../../par/proverbs/21-25.htm">Proverbs 21:25</a>, etc.). Vulgate, "The indolent wishers, and wishes not;" he wishes for something, but he wishes not for the labour of getting it; he would like the result, but he hates the process by which the result is to be obtained. Septuagint, "In desires every idle man is occupied;" his mind is fixed wholly on aimless wishes, not on action. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be made fat</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>); Septuagint, "The hands of the valiant are fully occupied (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>)."

So here it is not only verbal lying that is meant, but every kind of deceit and guile. This naturally betrays itself by the speech, according to the proverb, "Show me a liar, and I will show you a thief." <span class="cmt_word">A wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</span> The clause is variously translated. Vulgate, <span class="accented">confundit et confundetur</span>, "causes shame to others and to himself." Septuagint, "is put to shame, and shall not have licence of tongue (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Revised Version margin, "causeth shame and bringeth reproach." Delitzsch, "brings into bad odour (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>) and causes shame." Hitzig, "behaveth injuriously and shamefully." The antithesis is best brought out by the rendering that marks the effect of the wicked man's "lying;" "He brings disgrace upon others (who have trusted him or have been associated with him) and causes shame."

Those who are good and innocent in the walk of life are preserved from evil, moral and material. <span class="cmt_word">Wickedness overthroweth the sinner;</span> literally, <span class="accented">sin</span> "Overthroweth," makes to slip.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/13-7.htm">Proverbs 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">There is that maketh himself rich, yet <i>hath</i> nothing: <i>there is</i> that maketh himself poor, yet <i>hath</i> great riches.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing.</span> "Maketh" may mean "feigns." There are some who pretend to be rich while really they are poor (as <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-9.htm">Proverbs 12:9</a>), and there are some who make themselves, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> pretend to be poor (as misers) while they have much wealth. The Vulgate elucidates this meaning by rendering, <span class="accented">quasi dives</span> and <span class="accented">quasi pauper</span>; and the Hebrew verbs confirm its correctness. The proverb in both members teaches one not to trust to appearances. Septuagint, "There are who enrich themselves, having nothing; and there are who humble themselves amid much wealth." It is obvious that such a version lends itself to a Christian interpretation. The first clause reminds one of the rich fool who laid up treasure for himself, and was not rich toward God  (<a href="../../par/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17, 18</a>). The second clause teaches that wealth expended in God's service makes a man rich in the treasury of heaven (<a href="../../par/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21, 33</a>). One who thus uses the means entrusted to him could be spoken of like St. Paul, "as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/13-8.htm">Proverbs 13:8</a></div><div class="verse">The ransom of a man's life <i>are</i> his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The ransom of a man's life are his riches.</span> A rich man can save himself from many difficulties and dangers by the sacrifice of a portion of his wealth, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> when his money or his life is demanded by a robber; when men in authority make extortionate demands on pain of death; or when he has incurred extreme penalty by infringement of law (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22, 30</a>). Spiritually discerned, the passage recalls Christ's injunction, "Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The poor heareth not rebuke;</span> has not to listen to (<a href="../../par/job/3-18.htm">Job 3:18</a>) threats from the covetous or abuse from the envious. He has nothing to lose, and no one can gain anything by interfering with him. So the poor man is at peace.

But the verb is intransitive, and means "burn joyfully," bright and clear, as the sun rejoices as a strong man to run a race (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-5.htm">Psalm 19:5</a>). This light (<span class="accented">or</span>) is the grace and virtue which adorn the good man's life, and which beam through all his actions with a cheerful, kindly radiance (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18, 19</a>).

The lamp of the wicked is the false show of wisdom or piety, which may glimmer and deceive for a time, but is ere long detected and brought to naught. There may be here an allusion to a common custom in the East. "No house, however poor," says Dr. Geikie ('Holy Land,' 1:117), "is left without a light burning in it all night; the housewife rising betimes to secure its continuance by replenishing the lamp with oil. If a lamp goes out, it is a fatal omen" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-4.htm">1 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>). Septuagint, "The light of the righteous is everlasting; but the light of sinners is quenched." Then is introduced a couplet not found in the Hebrew, of which the latter part is borrowed from <a href="../../par/psalms/37-21.htm">Psalm 37:21</a> or Psalms 112:5, "Crafty souls go astray in sins; righteous men show mercy and pity." The Vulgate inserts this paragraph after ver. 13.

As the Vulgate puts it, "They who do all things with counsel are directed by wisdom." The LXX., reading differently, has, "They who know themselves are wise," which implies that the wise know their own weakness and imperfection, and hearken humbly to good counsel

Many refer this sentence to the impatient longing for heaven which holy men feel, such as we may read in 'De Imitatione,' 3:48, 49, and in the hymns, "For thee, O dear, dear country;" and "We've no abiding city," etc.  And St. Paul can exclaim (<a href="../../par/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>), "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>).

Many good authorities take the latter verb in another sense, "is pledged by it;" as Revised Version in margin, "maketh himself a debtor thereto," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is still bound to fulfil his obligations to it; he cannot escape duty by ignoring or despising it, but is pledged to do it, and will suffer for its neglect. Hence Christ's injunction to agree with our adversary quickly while we are in the way with him (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>). Vulgate, "He who disparages (<span class="accented">detrahit</span>) anything binds himself for the future." Septuagint, "He who despises a thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, 'a command') shall be despised by it." <span class="accented">Virtus se contemnentem contemnit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded</span> (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>).

The "fearing the commandment" implies obedience to it; and reward is considered as fully pledged to obedience as punishment is to neglect. The Septuagint here adds a distich which Ewald regards as genuine, "Unto a crafty son there shall be nothing good; but to a wise servant all actions shall prosper, and his way shall be guided aright." This is also found in the Vulgate of <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>.

Obedience to good teaching saves from many dangers, material and spiritual, especially from the snare of the devil (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>).

We are told of Christ that "he increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>). As a good and wise man uses his gifts and graces properly, he wins higher favour from God, and kindles the love and respect of his fellow men. Alter this clause the Septuagint introduces that which occurs also in <a href="../../par/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, "It belongs to a good understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) to know the Law." <span class="cmt_word">The way of transgressors is hard;</span> rough and rugged, leading to desolation, not to waters of comfort. Ecclus. 21:10, "The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell." Vulgate, "In the way of scorners is an abyss;" Septuagint, "The ways of scorners end in destruction."

A messenger who is false to his employer shall be detected and punished. The LXX., reading <span class="accented">melek</span> for <span class="accented">malak</span>, renders, "A rash king shall fall into evils."

Nowack takes the two nouns as predicates: "He that refuseth discipline is poverty and shame," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they are his lot. Such a one indulges his own lusts and passions, is headstrong in pursuing his own plans, and thus dissipates his fortune and acquires the contempt of all good men. Septuagint, "Discipline taketh away poverty and disgrace." He that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. To listen to rebuke and to profit thereby is a proof of humility and self-knowledge, which wins respect from others. Lesetre refers to Theodosius's submission to the sentence imposed upon him by St. Ambrose as a real honour and glory to him (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-1.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5, 32</a>).

This is usually taken to mean the desire of what is good and honest, when it is fulfilled and realized, is a source of highest joy and comfort to the wise. Septuagint, "The desires of the pious are sweet to the soul." <span class="cmt_word">But it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.</span> The antithesis is not very obvious, but it may be: it is sweet to a good man to obtain his wish; but for a wicked man to leave, to abandon evil to which he clings so fondly, is a detestable alternative. Or the latter clause may mean that the wicked will not give up the evil which makes the satisfaction of their desire impossible. But it is best to take the first clause as a general statement, viz. the satisfaction of desire is pleasant to all men; then the latter member gives a special case and will signify, "For the sake of this pleasure bad men will not give up their evil wishes and plans; they will pursue what they have set their heart upon because they hate the idea of foregoing their evil designs." Septuagint, "The deeds of sinners are far from knowledge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from practical wisdom, prudence, and piety. The Vulgate introduces quite another thought, "Fools abhor those who flee from evil." Compare the passage in Wisd. 2, concerning the sinner's hatred of the good.

But the antithesis is not well brought out by this rendering: and as the word may bear the sense of "doing ill" as well as of "suffering ill," the interpretation of the Vulgat. intimates the correct idea of the clause: "The friend of fools shall turn out the same;" "He who associates with fools shall do evil." Septuagint, "He who roams about with fools shall be known." "Tell me your companions, and I will tell you what you are." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Talis quis esse putatur qualis ei est sodalitas."</span> A Dutch proverb says, "He that lives with cripples learns to limp;" and the Spanish, "He that goes with wolves learns to howl."

The word rendered "tillage" (<span class="accented">nir</span>) means ground worked for the first time, and therefore that on which much labour is bestowed.

The poor, but righteous man, who industriously cultivates his little plot of ground, secures a good return, and is happy in eating the labour of his hands (<a href="../../par/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>). Intend of "the poor," the Vulgate has, "the fathers," taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> in this sense; so that  the meaning would be that children who properly cultivate their paternal or hereditary fields obtain good crops.

Some (poor men) are amply supplied by honest labour; others (rich) lose all by wrong dealing. Vulgate, "For others it (food) is gathered contrary to justice;" Septuagint, quite astray, The righteous shall pass many years in wealth; but the unrighteous shall suddenly perish" - which seems to be an explanation or amplification of ver. 22.
