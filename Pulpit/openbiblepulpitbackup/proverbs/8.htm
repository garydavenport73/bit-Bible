She is contrasted with the strange woman of ch. 7, and the exceeding greatness of the blessings which she offers exhibits in the most marked manner the nothingness of the deceiver's gifts. One is reminded of the celebrated episode of the choice of Hercules, delineated by Xenophon, 'Memorab.,' 2:1. 21, etc. The chapter divides itself into four sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Introductory (vers. 1-3); Wisdom calls on all to listen, and gives reasons for trusting to her (vers. 4-11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> She displays her  excellence (vers. 12-21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> She discourses of her origin and action (vers. 22-31). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> She again inculcates the duty of hearkening to her instructions (vers. 32-36). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Doth not Wisdom cry?</span> (see on Proverbs 1:20, and Introduction). The interrogative form, which expects an affirmative answer, is a mode of asserting a truth universally allowed. Wisdom is personified, though we are not so plainly confronted by an individual, as in the preceding case of the harlot. But it must be remembered that, whatever may have been the author's exact meaning, however worldly a view the original enunciation may have afforded, we, reading these chapters by the light cast upon them by later revelation, see m the description of Wisdom no mere ideal of practical prudence and good sense, no mere poetic personification of an abstract quality, but an adumbration of him who is the Wisdom of God, the coeternal Son of the Father. The open, bold, and public utterances of Wisdom are in happy contrast to the secret and stealthy enticements of Vice. So Christ, the true Wisdom, says, "I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret spake I nothing" (<a href="../../par/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). The Septuagint changes the subject of this verse, and makes the pupil addressed: "Thou shalt proclaim (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) wisdom, that understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) may obey thee;" which seems to mean that, if you wish to acquire wisdom, so that it may serve you practically, you must act as a herald or preacher, and make your desire generally known. St. Gregory has some remarks about wilful ignorance of what is right. "It is one thing," he says, "to be ignorant; another to have refused to learn. For not to know is only ignorance; to refuse to learn is pride. And they are the less able to plead ignorance in excuse, the more that knowledge is set before them, even against their will. We might, perhaps, be able to pass along the way of this present life in ignorance of this Wisdom, if she herself had not steed in the corners of the way" ('Moral.,' 25:29).

It is a fine picture of the comprehensiveness of the gospel, which is meant for high and low, prince and peasant; which is proclaimed everywhere, in the courts of kings, in the lanes of the country, in the hovels of the city; which sets forth the infinite love of God, who is not willing that any should perish, but would have all men come to the knowledge of the truth (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Septuagint, "By the gates of the mighty she sits, in the entrances she sings aloud (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)."

St. Gregory notes ('Moral ,' 27:6) that persons (<span class="accented">heroines</span>) of perfect life are in Scripture sometimes called "men" (<span class="accented">viri</span>). And again, "Scripture is wont to call those persons 'men' who follow the ways of the Lord with firm and steady steps. Whence Wisdom says in the Proverbs, 'Unto you, O men, I call.'

Early expositors take these words as spoken by Christ, to whom they are very plainly applicable (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>).

Thus the Book of Wisdom, which speaks of the duties of rulers, commences by addressing of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, "ye that are judges of the earth." In the East judgment of causes was an integral part of a monarch's duties.

Nowack compares <a href="../../par/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a> and Psalms 148:11, "Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth." The Fathers have taken these verses as spoken by God, and as asserting his supremacy and the providential ordering of human government, according to St. Paul's saying, "There is no power but of God; and the powers that be are ordained of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; see St. Augustine, 'De Civit. Dei,' 5:19).

"Magues amoris est amor." They who love virtue and wisdom are regarded with favour by God. whoso inspiration they have obeyed, obtaining grace for grace. So Ben Sira says, "Them that love her the Lord doth love "(Ecclus. 4:14); so Wisd. 7:28, "God loveth none but him that dwelleth with Wisdom." The Septuagint changes the verbs in this clause, though they are parts of the same word in the Hebrew: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;</span>. This reminds one of the passage in the last chapter of St. John (<a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). where a similar interchange is made. <span class="cmt_word">Those that seek me early shall find me</span> (see the contrast in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>). "Early" may mean from tender years; but more probably it is equivalent to "earnestly," "strenuously," as people deeply interested in any pursuit rise betimes to set about the necessary work (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-9.htm">Isaiah 26:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>). The Septuagint, "They who seek (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) me shall find."

Wisdom has these things in her possession to bestow on whom she will, as God gave them to Solomon in reward of his petition for wisdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Durable riches and righteousness.</span> Things often regarded as incompatible. <span class="accented">Durable</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">athek</span>), occurs only here (but see <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>), and means "old," "venerable," "long accumulated;" hence firm and lasting. Righteousness is the last reward that Wisdom bestows, without which, indeed, all material blessings would be nothing worth. Wealth obtained in a right way, and rightly used, is durable and stable. This was especially true under a temporal dispensation. We Christians, however, look not for reward in uncertain riches, but in God's favour here and happiness in another world. The Septuagint, "Possession of many things, and righteousness." What is denoted by "righteousness" is further explained in the following verses, 19-21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a></div><div class="verse">My fruit <i>is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My fruit is better than</span> <span class="cmt_word">gold.</span> We have had Wisdom called "a tree of life" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), and the gain from possessing her compared to gold and silver (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">paz</span>); Septuagint and Vulgate, "precious stone."

So the psalmist prays, "Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end;" "Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk" (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-33.htm">Psalm 119:33</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>). And the promise is given to the faithful in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>, "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left." Virtue, as Aristotle has taught us, is the mean between two extremes.

Those who love Wisdom will walk in her path, follow her leading, and therefore, doing God's will, will be blessed with success. Such will lay up treasure in heaven, will provide bags which wax not old, will be preparing for "an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). The LXX. here inserts a paragraph as a kind of introduction to the important section which follows: "If I declare unto you the things which daily befall, I will remember to recount the things of eternity;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thus far I have spoken of the advantages derived from Wisdom in daily circumstances; now I proceed to narrate her origin and her doings from all eternity. But the addition appears awkward, and is probably not now in its original position. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-31.</span> - Wisdom speaks of her origin, her active operations, the part which she bore in the creation of the universe, her relation to God (see on Proverbs 1:20 and Proverbs 3:19, and Introduction). It is impossible to decide what was the exact view of the writer with regard to the wisdom of which he speaks so eloquently; but there can be no doubt that he was guided in his diction so as to give expression to the idea of him whom St. John calls the Word of God. The language used is not applicable to an impersonal quality, an abstract faculty of God. It describes the nature and office of a Person; and who that Person is we learn from the later Scriptures, which speak of Christ as the "Wisdom of God" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>) and "the Power of God and the Wisdom of God" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). If we confine our inquiry to the question - What was in the mind of the author when he indited this wonderful section concerning Wisdom? we shall fail to apprehend its true significance, and shall be disowning the influence of the Holy Spirit, which inspires all Scripture, which prompted the holy men who spake to utter words of which they knew not the full spiritual significance, and which could only be understood by subsequent revelation. There is, then, nothing forced or incongruous in seeing in this episode a portraiture of the Second Person of the blessed Trinity, the essential Wisdom of God personified, the Logos of later books, and of the gospel. This interpretation obtained universally in the Church in the earliest times, and has commended itself to the most learned and reverent of modern commentators. That much which was contained in their own utterances was unknown to the prophets of old, that they did not fully perceive the mysteries which they darkly enunciated, we learn from St. Peter,  who tells us that they who prophesied of the grace of Christ sought and searched diligently what the Spirit of God that was in them did point unto, and were shown that not unto themselves, but unto us, they ministered those things, secrets which angels themselves desire to look into (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10</a>, etc.). Wisdom as a human endowment, animating all intellectual and even physical powers; Wisdom as communicating to man moral excellence and piety; Wisdom as not only an attribute of God, but itself as the eternal thought of God; - under these aspects it is regarded in our book; but under and through all it is more or less personified. <span class="accented">Khochmah</span> is contrasted in the next chapter, not with an abstraction, but with an actual woman of impure life - a real, not an imaginary, antagonist. The personality of the latter intimates that of the former (see Liddon, 'Bampt. Lects.,' 2.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord possessed me.</span> Great controversy has arisen about the word rendered "possessed." The verb used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kanah</span>), which means properly "to erect, set upright," also "to found, form" (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>), then "to acquire" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5, 7</a>, etc.) or "to possess" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-32.htm">Proverbs 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a>). The Vulgate, Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus, Venetian, give "possessed;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "made," and so Syriac. The Arians took the word in the sense of "created" (which, though supported by the LXX., it seems never to have had), and deduced therefrom the Son's inferiority to the Father - that he was made, not begotten from all eternity. Ben Sira more than once employs the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> in speaking of Wisdom's origin; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ecclus. 1:4, 9 Ecclus. 24:8. Opposing the heresy of the Arians, the Fathers generally adopted the rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">possedit</span>, "possessed;" and even those who received the translation <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, explained it not of creating, but of appointing, thus: The Father set Wisdom over all created things, or made Wisdom to be the efficient cause of his creatures (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>). May we not say that the writer was guided to use a word which would express relation in a twofold sense? Wisdom is regarded either as the mind of God expressed in operation, or the Second Person of the Holy Trinity; and the verb thus signifies that God possesses in himself this essential Wisdom, and intimates likewise that Wisdom by eternal generation is a Divine Personality. St. John (<a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), before saying that the Word was God, affirms that "the Word was with God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)." So we may assert that Solomon has arrived at the truth that Wisdom was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, if he has left it for later revelation to declare that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. Whichever sense we assign to the verb on which the difficulty is supposed to hang, whether we take it as "possessed," "formed," or "acquired," we may safely assume that the idea conveyed to Christian minds is this - that Wisdom, existing eternally in the Godhead, was said to be "formed" or "brought forth" when it operated in creation, and when it assumed human nature. <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of his way.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in initio viarum suarum.</span> But the preposition "in" does not occur in the original; and the words may be bettor translated, "as the beginning of his way" (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the earliest revelation of his working. Wisdom, eternal and uncreated, first puts forth its energy in creation, then becomes incarnate, and is now called, "the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). Thus in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>); and, "When he bringeth in the Firstborn into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>). In the present clause, the ways of God are his works, as in <a href="../../par/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a> and Job 40:19, where behemoth is called "chief among the ways of God" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>, where "ways" stands as a parallel to "works"). <span class="cmt_word">Before his works of old.</span> These words are better regarded (with Delitzsch) as a second parallel object, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">kedem</span>), translated "before," being not a preposition, but denoting previous existence. Hence we translate, "The foremost of his works of old;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the earliest revelation of his energy. There is a curious passage in the 'Book of Enoch,' ch. 42, which speaks of the personality and pre-existence of Wisdom, of her desire to dwell among men, frustrated by man's wickedness: "Wisdom found no place where she could dwell; therefore was her dwelling in heaven. Wisdom came forth in order to dwell among the sons of men, and found no habitation; then she returned to her place, and took her seat among the angels." We may add Wisd. 8:3, "In that she dwelleth with God (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), she magnifieth her nobility."

Both here and there it has been translated "anointed," which would make a noteworthy reference to Christ. But there  seems no proof that the word has this meaning. It signifies properly "to pour forth" (as of molten metal), then "to put down," "to appoint or establish." The versions recognize this. Thus the Septuagint, "he established (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) me;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ordinata sum</span>; Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:9). So what is here said is that Wisdom was from everlasting exalted as ruler and disposer of all things. To express eternal relation, three synonymous terms are used.

It is questioned <span class="accented">where</span> the mountains were supposed to be fixed, and some have thought that they are represented as fixed in the depths of the earth. But, as we learn from <a href="../../par/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>, they are regarded as rising from the waters, their foundations are laid in the great deep. So the psalmist, speaking of the waters, says, "They went up by the mountains, they went down by the valleys, unto the place which thou hast founded for them" (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-8.htm">Psalm 104:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>). What is here affirmed of Wisdom is said of Jehovah in <a href="../../par/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth, nor the fields</span>. The distinction intended is land as cultivated and occupied by buildings, etc., and waste uncultivated land outside towns. Septuagint, "The Lord made countries and uninhabited places (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Adhuc terram non fecerat, et flumina.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">chutsoth</span>; things without, abroad, hence open country. The Vulgate rendering, and that of Aquila and Symmaehus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, are plainly erroneous, as waters have already been mentioned (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">The highest part of the dust of the world;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the head of the dusts of the world.</span> Some have interpreted this expression of "man," the chief of those creatures which are made of the dust of the ground (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>). But the idea comes in awkwardly here; it is not natural to introduce man amid the inanimate works of nature, or to use such an enigmatical designation for him. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">cardines orbis terrarum</span>, "the world's hinges;" Septuagint, "the inhabited summits of the earth beneath the heavens; according to St. Hilary ('De Trinit.,' 12), "cacumina quae habitantur sub coelo." Others take the term to signify the capes or promontories ot the world, the peaks and elevations; others, the clods of dry, amble land, in contrast to the untilled waste of waters; others, the chief elements, the matter of which the earth is composed. This last interpretation would lead us back to a period which has already been passed. Amid the many possible explanations, it is perhaps best (with Delitzsch, Nowack, etc.) to take <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "head" as equivalent to "sum," "mass," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/139-17.htm">Psalm 139:17</a>. "How great is the sum (<span class="accented">rosh</span>) of them!" Then the expression comprehensively means all the mass of earth's dust.

Thus in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> we have, "It is he that sitteth above the circle (<span class="accented">chug</span>) of the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vault of heaven that encircles the earth. Septuagint, "When he  marked out (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;</span>) his throne upon the winds." The translators have referred <span class="accented">tchom</span>, "depth," to the waters above.

The Hebrew word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">amon</span>), "an artificer," "workman" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-15.htm">Jeremiah 52:15</a>). Thus in Wisd. 7:22 Wisdom is called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the worker of all things." The Authorized Version takes the word in a passive state, as equivalent to <span class="accented">alumnus</span>, "foster child." and this interpretation is etymologically admissible, and may possibly, as Schultens suggests, be glanced at in St. John's expression (John 1:18), "the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father." But as the point here is the creative energy of Wisdom, it is best to take the term as denoting "artificer." It will then accord with the expression <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by the Fathers to the Word of God, by whom all things were made (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, Textus Receptus, and <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And I was daily his delight;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I was delights day by day</span>, which may mean either as in Authorized Version, or "I had delight continually," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it may signify <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either that God took pleasure in the wisdom which displayed his workmanship, saw that it was very good (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-4.htm">Genesis 1:4</a>, etc.), looked with delight on the beloved Son in whom he was well pleased (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, etc.); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may mean that Wisdom herself rejoiced in her power and her work, rejoiced in giving effect to the Creator's idea, and so "founding the earth" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">delectabar per singulos dies.</span> The Septuagint adopts the former of these views, "I was that wherein he took delight." But the second interpretation seems most suitable, as the paragraph is stating rather what Wisdom is in herself than what she was in the eyes of Jehovah. What follows is a parallel. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoicing always before him;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">ludens coram eo omni tempore</span>, as though the work of creation was a sport and pastime of a happy holiday. The expression is meant to denote the ease with which the operations were performed, and the pleasure which their execution yielded. David uses the same word, speaking of his dancing before the ark, when he says. "Therefore will I play before the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>).

Septuagint, "Because he rejoiced when he completed the world (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), and rejoiced in the children of men."

A similar promise is made at <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16, 18, 22</a>. The truth here enunciated is also spoken or the Word of God, the everlasting Son of the Father. <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>, "In him was life; and the life was the light of men;" <a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, "He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life;" <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, "This is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ" (comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>; Ecclus. 4:12). <span class="cmt_word">Shall obtain favour of the Lord;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">hauriet salutem</span>, which happily renders the Hebrew verb (<a href="../../par/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>). The grace of God bringeth salvation (<a href="../../par/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>).

This latter clause was used by the Fathers, especially in the Pelagian controversy, to prove the necessity of prevenient grace (see St. Augustine, 'Enchiridion,' 2:32; 'De Gratia,' 6:16, 17).

And the truth stated is obvious - he who refuses to obey Wisdom, and transgresses her wholesome rules, will smart for it.
