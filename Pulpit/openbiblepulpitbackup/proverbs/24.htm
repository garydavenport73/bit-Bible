"Wisdom" (<span class="accented">chochmoth</span>) is in the plural number, intimating the various attributes connoted by it, or the different aspects in which it may be regarded (see note on Proverbs 1:20). "Too high" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ramoth</span>) is also plural; and Delitzsch and Nowack take it to mean, not so much "high things" as "precious things," such as pearls or precious stones, in accordance with <a href="../../par/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>, "No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; yea,. the price of wisdom is above rubies." In this sense Delitzsch translates, "Wisdom seems to the fool to be an ornamental commodity," a costly and unnecessary appendage, which is not worth the sacrifices entailed by its pursuit. Whichever way we take it, the point is the rarity and inaccessibility of wisdom, and the repugnance of fools to make any exertion in order to obtain it. St. Augustine thus sums up the steps by which wisdom is reached: fear of God, piety, knowledge, fortitude, mercifulness, sincerity ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 2:7). <span class="cmt_word">He openeth not him month in the gate.</span> When men gather in the usual place of assembly (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>), to take counsel on public matters, he has nothing to say; he listens fatuously, and is silent. Septuagint, "Wisdom and good thought are in the gates of the wise; the wise turn not aside from the mouth of the Lord, but reason in assemblies."

"Sin" is the subject in this clause as "the scorner" is in the next; and what it says is that sin is the exeogitation, the contriving of folly. The stoner is the real fool, m that he does not pursue his proper end, prepares misery for himself, is blind to his best interests. The connection between sin and folly, as between wisdom and righteousness, is continually enforced throughout the book. <span class="cmt_word">The scorner is an abomination</span> <span class="cmt_word">to men.</span> The man who scoffs at religion and every high aim is an object of abomination to the pious, and is also a cause of evil to others, leading them to thoughts and acts which are hateful in the eyes of God. Septuagint, "The fool dieth in sins (<a href="../../par/john/8-24.htm">John 8:24</a>), and uncleanness belongeth to a pestilent man." The  text here followed, as in other passages of this chapter, is quite different from the received one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-10.htm">Proverbs 24:10</a></div><div class="verse"><i>If</i> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <i>is</i> small.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.</span> The gnome seems to be unconnected with the preceding. There is a paronomasia between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tsarah</span>), "adversity," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">tsar</span>), "small," narrow, which is retained by Fleischer: "Si segnis fueris die angustiae, angustae sunt vires tuae." So we may say in English, "If thou faint in time of straitness, straitened is thy strength." If you fail, and succumb to anxiety or danger, instead of rising to meet the emergency, then you are but a weakling or a coward, and the strength which you seemed to possess and of which you boasted, perhaps, is nothing worth. Such a man hearkens not to the Sibyl's counsel (Virgil, 'AEneid,' 6:95) ? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Tu ne cede malis, sed contra audentior ito,<br />Quam tua te fortuna sinet."</span> The LXX. again varies from the received text, "He shall be polluted in an evil day, and in a day of affliction, until he fail," or "die" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>).

"would that!" So the first hemistich should be rendered, "Deliver them that are haled to death," and the second, "And those that are tottering to slaughter, oh, hold them back!" The sentence is somewhat obscure, but Cheyne well explains it thus: "Some victims of a miscarriage of justice are about to be dragged away to execution, and the disciple of wisdom is exhorted to use his endeavours to deliver them" ('Job and Solomon'). In the case supposed a moral obligation lies on the pious and well-informed to save a human life unjustly imperilled. At the same time, there is nothing in the passage which absolutely, shows that the punishment of the guiltless is here deprecated; it looks rather as if Wisdom had no pleasure in the death of men, innocent or not, and that the victims of an extreme sentence claimed pity at her hands, whatever might be the circumstances of the verdict. Septuagint, "Deliver those that are being led away to death, and redeem (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) those that are appointed to be slain; spare not (to help them)" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3, 4</a>).

St. Jerome makes the excuse to be inability, <span class="accented">vires</span> <span class="accented">non suppetunt</span>. The LXX. makes it a personal matter, ignoring the plural form of the previous paragraph. "I know him not, he is no friend of mine; why should I trouble myself about him?" Such a selfish person, like the priest and Levite in the parable, would "pass by on the other side." <span class="cmt_word">Doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it?</span> God knows the truth - knows that the excuse is vain; for he is the Weigher and Searcher of hearts (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>). Cain's plea, "Am I my brother's keeper?" is unavailable; the law of love is limited by no circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?</span> The expression, "keeping the soul," may be equivalent to "preserving the life;" but it more probably means watching, observing, the inmost secrets of the nature (<a href="../../par/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>). The verb used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">natsar</span>), which has both significations. The sense of "forming." which some give it, seems not allowable.

"I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey," says the lover in <a href="../../par/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>; and the psalmist says that the ordinances of the Lord are "sweeter than honey and the honeycomb" (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>; see on Proverbs 25:16).

Spoil not his resting-place. "Spoil," as <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a> (where see note). Drive him not from his house by violence and chicanery.

Preachers, ancient and modern, have made much use of this text in the first sense, expatiating how a good man may fall into venial or more serious sins, but he never loses his love of God, and rises from his fall by repentance on every occasion. We also often find the words <span class="accented">in die</span>, "a day," added, which indeed occur in some manuscripts, but are not in the original. But the verb <span class="accented">naphal</span> seems not to be used in the sense of "falling" morally; and the meaning here is that the just man frequently falls into trouble, - he is not secure against worldly cares and losses, or the insidious attacks of the man mentioned in Ver. 15; but he never loses his trust in God or offends by fretfulness and impatience, and always God's providence watches over him and delivers him out of all his afflictions. "Seven times" means merely often, that number being used to express plurality or completeness (see on Proverbs 6:31; 26:16; and comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> (which is like our passage); and <a href="../../par/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>). The expectation which the sinner conceived when he saw the good man distressed, that he might seize the opportunity and use it to his own benefit, is woefully disappointed. In contrast with the recovery and reestablishment of the righteous, when the wicked suffer calamity there is no recuperation for them. <span class="cmt_word">The wicked shall fall into mischief;</span> Revised Version better, <span class="accented">are overthrown by calamity</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-32.htm">Proverbs 14:32</a>, and note there).

Thus we have the triumph of Moses at the defeat of the Amalekites, and over Pharaoh's host at the Red Sea; of Deborah and Barak over Sisera (<a href="../../par/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>); and the psalmist, exulting over the destruction of his country's foes, could say, "The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked" (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>). But private revenge and vindictiveness are warmly censured and repudiated. So Cato, 'Distich.' 4:46 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Morte repentina noli gaudere malorum;<br />Felicesobeunt quorum sine crimine vita est."</span> Of very different tone is the Italian proverb, "Revenge is a morsel for God;" and "Wait time and place to act thy revenge, for it is never well done in a hurry" (Trench). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-18.htm">Proverbs 24:18</a></div><div class="verse">Lest the LORD see <i>it</i>, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest the Lord see it, and it displease him.</span> This malignant pleasure at others' misfortunes (which Aristotle, 'Eth. Nic.,' 2:7. 15, calls <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is a sin in the eyes of God, and calls for punishment. <span class="cmt_word">And he turn away his wrath from him;</span> and, as is implied, direct it upon thee. But it seems a mean motive to adduce, if the maxim is taken baldly to mean, "Do not rejoice at your enemy's calamity, lest God relieve him from the evil:" for true charity would wish for such a result. Bode considers "his wrath" to be the enemy's ill will against thee, which God by his grace changes to love, and thou art thus covered with confusion and shame for thy former vindictiveness. But the point is not so much the removal of God's  displeasure from the enemy as the punishment of the malignant man, either mentally or materially. To a malignant mind no severer blow could be given than to see a foe recover God's favor and rise from his fall. The moralist then warns the disciple against giving way to this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> lest he prepare for himself bitter mortification by having to witness the restoration of the hated one, or by being himself made to suffer that evil which he had rejoiced to see his neighbour experience (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>, and note there). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19</a></div><div class="verse">Fret not thyself because of evil <i>men</i>, neither be thou envious at the wicked;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - A warning against envying the prosperity of the wicked. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Fret not thyself because of evil men (comp. Ver. 1 and <a href="../../par/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>). The verb (<span class="accented">charah</span>) means "to burn," "to be angry;" so here we may render, "Be not enraged on account of evil doers." The anger would arise on account of the apparent inequitable distribution of blessings. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ne contendas cum pessimis</span>; Septuagint, "Rejoice not over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) evildoers." <span class="cmt_word">Neither be thou envious at the wicked;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. do not fancy that their prosperity is to be desired, nor be led to imitate their doings in order to secure like success. The new verse shows the solemn reason for this warning.

Septuagint, "For the evil man shall have no posterity, and the torch of the wicked shall be quenched." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21</a></div><div class="verse">My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: <i>and</i> meddle not with them that are given to change:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - An injunction urging loyalty to God and the king. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fear thou the Lord and the king.</span> The king is God's vicegerent and representative, and therefore to be honoured and obeyed (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meddle not with them that are given to change.</span> There is some doubt about the intepretation of the last word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shonim</span>), which may mean those who change, innovators (in which transitive sense the verb does not elsewhere occur), or those who think differently, dissidents, who respect neither God nor the king. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> signifies transitively "to repeat," and intransitively "to be changed;" so it may be most accurately translated here, with Delitzsch, "those who are otherwise disposed," who have not the proper sentiments of fear and honour for God and the king. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Et cum detractoribus non commiscearis</span>, by which word he probably means what we call revolutionists, persons who disparage and despise all authority. Septuagint, "Fear God and the king, and disobey neither of them." The verse has been largely used as a text by preachers who desired to recommend loyalty and to censure disaffection and rebellion. It has been a favourite motto for discourses on the Gunpowder Treason and the execution of Charles I. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a></div><div class="verse">For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For their calamity shall rise suddenly.</span> Though these dissidents seem to succeed for a time, yet retribution shall fall suddenly upon them. <span class="cmt_word">And who knoweth the ruin of them both?</span> This seems to mean the two classes, those who dishonour God and those who dishonour the king; but no such distinction is made in the previous verse; the rebels are classed under one category. Wordsworth renders, "the stroke of vengeance from them both," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. from God and the king. Otherwise, we must give another signification to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>, and, with the Syriac and many modern commentators, take it in the sense of "years," which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> will bear, as <a href="../../par/job/36-11.htm">Job 36:11</a>, and translate, "The destruction [equivalent to 'end'] of their years, who knoweth?" No one can tell when the crisis of their fate shall come; but it will arrive some day, and then the time of their prosperity will be at an end. Septuagint, "For they (God and the king) will suddenly punish the ungodly; and who shall know the vengeance of both (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)?" After this the LXX. inserts three proverbs not found now in the Hebrew, which, however, Ewald ('Jahrb. der Bibl. Wissensch.,' 11:17, etc.) considers to have been translated from a Hebrew original: "A son that keepeth the commandment shall be safe from destruction (<a href="../../par/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a>, Vulgate), and he hath fully received it (the word). Let no lie be spoken by the tongue of the king; and no he shall proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not of flesh; and whosoever shall be delivered unto it shall be destroyed; for if his anger be inflamed, he consumes men with their nerves, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not food for the young eagles." The allusion at the end is to animals killed by lightning. Here follows the series of proverbs (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1-14</a>) called in the Hebrew, "The words of Agur." The second part of "the words of Agur," and "the words of Lemuel" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-31:9</a>) follow in the Greek after <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-34.htm">Proverbs 24:34</a> of the Hebrew. Delitzsch explains the matter thus: In the copy from which the Alexandrines translated, the appendix (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30-31:9</a>) was divided into two parts, half of it standing after "the words of the wise" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17-24:22</a>), and half after the supplement containing further sayings of wise men (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23-34</a>).  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>things</i> also <i>belong</i> to the wise. <i>It is</i> not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-34.</span> - Part V. A SECOND COLLECTION, forming a second supplement to the first Solomonic book, and containing further "words of the wise." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25.</span> - Partiality and impartiality a hexastich. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These things also belong to the wise;</span> are the sayings of wise men. The following proverbs, as well as the preceding, are derived from wise men. Mistaking this superscription, the LXX. makes it a personal address: "This I say to you who are wise, so that ye may learn." The first line is not a proverb, but the introduction to the ensuing collection. <span class="cmt_word">It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment</span> (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>, and note there; and <a href="../../par/proverbs/28-21.htm">Proverbs 28:21</a>, where the expression is the same as here). To regard one person before another is to be partial and unjust. To say this error is "not good" is a meiosis, the meaning being that it is very evil and sinful (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>). The statement is developed and confirmed in the next two verses, which show the results of partiality and its opposite. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24</a></div><div class="verse">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <i>art</i> righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous.</span> The judge is supposed to be acquitting a guilty person. <span class="cmt_word">Him shall the people curse.</span> The Hebrew is "peoples," as Septuagint and Vulgate, <span class="accented">maledicient eis populi</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Nations shall abhor him.</span> Not individuals, nor families only, but the whole community, wherever such an iniquitous ruler is found, shall execrate and hate him. The voice of the people is universally against him; no one is so blind and degraded as openly to applaud his nets. The verb <span class="accented">nakab</span>, "to curse," means primarily "to bore or pierce;" hence some have translated it here, "him shall the peoples stab." But the word is used in the sense of distinguishing by a mark or brand, and thence passes into the sense of cursing, as at <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-11.htm">Leviticus 24:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a> the unjust judge is called an abomination to the Lord.

An answer that is fair and suitable to the circumstances is as pleasant and assuring to the bearers as a kiss on the lips. Such a salutation would be a natural sign of sympathy and affection. Thus Absalom won the hearts of the people by kissing those who came to court with their suits (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-5.htm">2 Samuel 15:5</a>). In <a href="../../par/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>, where the Authorized Version has, "According to thy word shall all my people be ruled," the Hebrew runs, "Thy mouth shall all my people kiss," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they shall do homage to thee, which is another signification of this action. This, however, would not be suitable here, as the kiss is supposed to be given by the speaker, though the LXX. mistakenly translates, "But men will kiss lips that answer good words."

"Without" (<span class="accented">chuts</span>) (<a href="../../par/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-26.htm">Proverbs 8:26</a>); in the fields. Put in due order all immediate work in thy farm. <span class="cmt_word">And make it fit for thyself in the field;</span> and get ready for what has to come next. That is, in short, steadily and with due foresight cultivate your land; provide abundant means of subsistence before you attempt to build up your house. A suitor had, as it were, to purchase his bride from her relations by making considerable presents; it was therefore necessary to provide a certain amount of wealth before contemplating matrimony. <span class="cmt_word">And afterwards build thy house.</span> This is, indeed, the meaning of the passage; but the Hebrew makes a difficulty, as it is literally, "afterwards and thou shalt build." Some have supposed that some words have dropped out of the text (Cheyne, 'Job and Solomon'). But <span class="accented">vav</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;</span>, coming after a date or notification of time, as here after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>), "has the future signification of a perfect consecutive" (Delitzsch), equivalent to "after that, then, thou mayest build."

In a spiritual sense, the heart must be first cleared of thorns, and opened to genial influences, before the man can build up the fabric of virtuous habits, and thus arrive at the virtuous character.

Persons are not to put themselves forward to give testimony to a neighbour's discredit, either officiously as busybodies, or maliciously as slanderers. The maxim is expressed in general terms  and is not to be confined to one category, as the Syriac and Septuagint render, "Be not a false witness against thy fellow citizen." <span class="cmt_word">And deceive not with thy lips.</span> The Hebrew is really interrogative, "And wouldest thou deceive with thy lips?" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-36.htm">Psalm 78:36</a>). The deceit is not so much intentional falsehood as misrepresentation arising from haste and inconsiderateness consequent on this unnecessary eagerness to push forward testimony unsought.

Moralizing on this passage, St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 20:54) says, "To pass by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding, is to look into the life of any careless liver, and to take a view of his deeds."

The stinging nettle is quite common in Palestine, but the plant here meant is probably the prickly acanthus, which quickly covers any spot left uncultivated (<a href="../../par/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>).

Ovid, 'Trist.,' 5:12. 21 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adde, quod ingenium louga rubigine laesum<br />Torpet, et est multo, quam fuitante, minus.<br />Fertilis, assiduo si non renovetur aratro,<br />Nil, nisicum spinis gramen, habebit ager."</span> So spiritual writers have used this apologue as teaching a lesson concerning the soul and the life of man, how that spiritual sloth allows the growth of evil habits, and the carelessness which maintains not the defence of law and prayer, but admits the enemy, and the result is the loss of the true riches and the perishing of the heavenly life. The two verses are thus rendered, or morally applied, in the Septuagint: "A foolish man is as a farm. and a man wanting in sense is as a vineyard; if you leave him, he will be barren, and will be altogether covered with weeds, and he will become deserted, and his fences of stone are broken down."

But if thou do this, thy poverty will come advancing, and thy want like a good runner (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>)" The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>, but nowhere else in the Septuagint. It is used by St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/9-36.htm">Mark 9:36</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>). It has been thought that the original <span class="accented">mashal</span> ended with Ver. 32, the following passage being added by a scribe as illustrative in a marginal note, which afterwards crept into the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
