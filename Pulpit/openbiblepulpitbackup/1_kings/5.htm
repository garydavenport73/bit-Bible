According to Dins (quoted by Josephus contr. Apion, 1:17) Hiram was the son of Abibaal. Menander states that the building of the temple was commenced in the twelfth year of Hiram's reign, which lasted 34 years (Jos. Ant. 8:03.1; Contr. Ap. 1:18).

"It is the <span class="accented">Merit Blanc</span> of Palestine" (Porter); but whether it is so called because of its summits of snow or because of the colour of its limestone is uncertain. Practically, the cedars are now found in one place only, though Ehrenberg is said to have found them in considerable numbers to the north of the road between Baalbek and Tripoli. "At the head of Wady Kadisha there is a vast recess in the central ridge of Lebanon, some eight miles in diameter. Above it rise the loftiest summits in Syria, streaked with perpetual snow...  In the very centre of this recess, on a little irregular knoll, stands the clump of cedars" (<span class="accented">Ibid.</span>, Handbook, 2 p. 584), over 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. It would seem as if that part of Lebanon where the cedars grew belonged to Hiram's dominion. "The northern frontier of Canaan did not reach as far as Bjerrsh" (Keil), where the cedar grove is now. The idea of some older writers that the cedars belonged to Solomon, and  that he only asked Hiram for artificers ("that they <span class="accented">hew</span> me cedar trees," etc.) is negatived by ver. 10. It is true that "all Lebanon" was given to Israel (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), but they did not take it. They did not drive out the Zidonians (ver. 6; <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>) or possess" the land of the Giblites" (ver. 5; <a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>). It should be stated here, however, that the cedar of Scripture probably included other varieties than that which now, alone bears the name (see on ver. 8)], <span class="cmt_word">and my servants shall be with Shy servants</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, sharing and lightening the work]: <span class="cmt_word">and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants</span> [Solomon engaged to pay and did pay both Hiram and his subjects for the services of the latter, and he paid both in kind.

See note on ver. 18. By profane, as well as sacred writers, the Phoenicians are often described by the name Zidonians, no doubt for the reason mentioned in the note on ver. 1. See Homer, Iliad 6:290; 23. 743; Odys. 4:84, 618; 17:4.24. Cf. Virg. AEn. 1. 677, 678; 4:545, etc. <a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1, 33</a>, etc. "The mechanical skill of the Phoenicians generally, and of the Zidonians in particular, is noticed by many ancient writers," Rawlinson, who cites instances in his note. But what deserves especial notice here is the fact that the Zidonians constructed their houses of <span class="accented">wood</span>, and were celebrated from the earliest times as skilful builders. The fleets which the Phoenicians constructed for purposes of commerce would ensure them a supply of clever workmen. Wordsworth aptly remarks on the part the heathen thus took in rearing a temple for the God of Jacob. Cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10, 13</a>.]

We are not warranted by the expression of the text in concluding that Hiram believed in the exclusive divinity of the God of Israel, or "identified Jehovah with Melkarth his god" (Rawlinson), much less that he was  proselyte to the faith of David and Solomon. All that is certain is that he believed the Jehovah as God was quite compatible with the retention of a firm faith in Baa1 and Astarte. It is also possible that he here adopts a language which he knew would be acceptable to Solomon, or the historian may have given us his thoughts in a Hebrew dread It is noticeable that the LXX. has simply <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">which hath given unto David a wise son</span> [Compare <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-9.htm">1 Kings 2:9</a>. The proof of wisdom lay in Solomon's fulfilling his wise father's purposes, and in his care for the worship of God. "Wise," however, is not used here in the sense of "pious," as Bahr affirms. In Hiram's lips the word meant discreet, sagacious. He would hardly recognize the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom] <span class="cmt_word">over this great people.</span>

It is instructive to remember in connexion with this fact that, according to the universal belief of antiquity, the use of letters, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the art of writing, was communicated to the Greeks by the Phoenicians. Gesenius, indeed, holds that the <span class="accented">invention</span> of letters is also due to them. See the interesting remarks of Mr. Twisleton, Dict. Bib. 2. pp. 866-868], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I have considered the things which thou sentest unto me for</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">heard the things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, message) <span class="accented">which thou sentest unto</span> me]: <span class="cmt_word">and I will do all thy desire concerning</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in, i.e.</span>, as to] timber [or <span class="accented">trees</span>] of cedar [Heb. <span class="accented">cedars</span>] <span class="accented">and timber of fir</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">trees of cypresses.</span> This is, perhaps, the proper place to inquire what. trees are intended by the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, here respectively translated" cedar" and "fir." As to the first, it is impossible to restrict the word to the one species (<span class="accented">Pinus cedrus or Cedrus Libani</span>) which is now known as the cedar of Lebanon, or, indeed, to <span class="accented">any</span> single plant. That the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span>, one of the most magnificent of trees, is meant in such passages as <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31.htm">Ezekiel 31</a>, <a href="../../par/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>, etc., admits of no manner of doubt. It is equally clear, however, that in other passages the term "cedar" must refer to some other tree. In <a href="../../par/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>, and <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>, <span class="accented">e.g., the juniper</span> would seem to be meant. "The cedar could not have been procured in the desert without great difficulty, but the juniper (<span class="accented">Juniperus oxycedrus</span>) is most plentiful there." (The "cedar" of our pencils, it may be remarked, is a kind of juniper - <span class="accented">Juniperus Bermudiana.</span>) In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>, "they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make <span class="accented">masts</span> for thee," it is probable that the <span class="accented">Pinus</span>  <span class="accented">Halepensis</span>, not, as was formerly thought, the Scotch fir (<span class="accented">Pinus sylvestris</span>), is intended. The <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span> appears to be indifferently adapted to any such purpose, for which, however, the <span class="accented">Pinus Halepensis <span class="cmt_word"></span>is</span> eminently fitted. But in the text, as throughout ch. 5-8, the reference, it can hardly be doubted, is to the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani.</span> It is true the wood of this species is neither beautiful nor remarkably durable. Dr. Lindley calls it the "worthless, though magnificent cedar," but the former adjective, however true it may be of English-grown cedar, cannot justly be applied to the tree of the Lebanon mountain. The writer has some wood in his possession, brought by him from the Lebanon, and though it has neither fragrance nor veining, it is unmistakably a hard and resinous wood. And it should be remembered that it was only employed by Solomon in the <span class="accented">interior</span> of the temple, and was there, for the most part, overlaid with gold, and that the climate of Palestine is much less destructive than our own. There seems to be no sufficient reason, therefore, for rejecting the traditional and till recently universal belief that the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span> was the timber chosen for the temple use. Mr. Houghton, in Smith's Dict. Bib., vol. 3. App. A. p. 40, who speaks of it "as being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> firmest and grandest of the conifers," says at the same time that "it has no particular quality to recommend it for building purposes; it was probably therefore not very extensively used in the construction of the temple." But no other tree can be suggested which better suits the conditions of the sacred narrative. The <span class="accented">deodara</span>, which has found favour with some writers, it is now positively stated, does not grow near the Lebanon. It may be added that, under the name of <span class="accented">Eres, the</span> yew was probably included. The timber used in the palaces of Nineveh, which was long believed to be cedar, is now proved to be yew (Dict. Bib., art. "Cedar"). However it is certain that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span> is a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> which includes, at any rate, the pine, the cedar, and the juniper, in confirmation of which it may be mentioned that at the present day, "the name <span class="accented">arz is</span> applied by the Arabs to all three" (Royle, in Kitto's Cyclop., art. "Eres"). The Grove of Cedars now numbers about 450 trees, great and small. Of these about a dozen are of prodigious size and considerable antiquity, possibly carrying us back (as the natives think) to the time of Solomon. Their precise age, however, can only be a matter of conjecture. The identification of the "fir" is even more precarious than that of the cedar. Celsius would see in this the true cedar of Lebanon. Others identify it with the juniper (<span class="accented">Juniperus excelsa</span>) or with the <span class="accented">Pinus Halepensis</span>, but most writers (among whom are Keil and Bahr) believe the evergreen cypress (<span class="accented">Cupressus sempervirens</span>) to be intended. Very probably the name <span class="accented">Berosh</span> comprehended two or three different species, as the cypress, the juniper, and the savine. The first named grows even near the summits of the mountain. Bahr says it is inferior to cedar (but see above). According to Winer, it is well fitted for building purposes, as" it is not eaten by worms, and is almost imperishable and very light." It is certainly of a harder and closer grain, and more durable than the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani.</span> It shows the brevity of our account that Solomon has not mentioned his desire for "fir" as well as" cedar."

The cedars are ten hours distant from Tripoli, and the road must always have been a bad one. ("What a road it is for mortals. In some spots it seems to have been intended for mountain goats only ..... It winds up sublime glens, and zigzags up rocky acclivities, and passes over stone-strewn terraces," etc. (Porter, Handbook, p. 583.) To the writer it appeared to be the most rugged and dangerous road in Palestine. It is possible that the timber was collected and floated at Gebal (Biblus. See note on ver. 18). Beyrout, the present port of the Lebanon, is 27 hours distant <span class="accented">via Tripoli.</span> But cedars would then, no doubt, be found nearer the sea. And the ancients (as the stones of Baalbek, etc., prove) were not altogether deficient in mechanical appliances.

The fact that 20,000 ears of wheat formed a part of each has led to their being confounded (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the marginal references). It is noticeable that when the <span class="accented">second</span> temple was built, cedar wood was again brought to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">rid</span> Joppa, in return for "meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon" (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). The selection of <span class="accented">food</span> as the hire of his servants by Hiram almost amounts to an undesigned coincidence. Their narrow strip of cornland, between the roots of Lebanon and the coast - Phoenicia proper ("the great plain of the city of Sidon," Josephus. Ant. 5:03, 1) is only 28 miles long, with an average breadth of one mile-compelled the importation of corn and oil. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:17) mentions wheat, honey, oil, and balm as exported from Palestine to the markets of Tyre. It has been justly remarked that the fact that Phoenicia was thus dependent upon Palestine for its breadstuffs explains the unbroken peace that prevailed between the two countries (Heeren. See Dict. Bib. if. p. 865).

They occupied a very different position from that of the 30,000 Hebrews. None of the latter were reduced to bondage (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>), while the former had long been employed in servile work. The Gibeonites were reduced to serfdom by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), and the rest of the Canaanites as they were conquered  (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-10.htm">Joshua 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29, 30</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>, we find some of them employed on public works by David. By the "hewers" many commentators have supposed that stonecutters alone are intended (so Jos., Ant., 8:02.9) partly because stone is mentioned presently, and partly because <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> is mostly used of the quarrying or cutting of stone, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-12.htm">2 Kings 12:12</a>, etc. Gesenius understands the word both of stone and wood cutters. But is it not probable that the latter alone are indicated? That the word is sometimes used of woodcutting <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a> shows. And the words, "<span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the mountain"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) almost compel us so to understand it here. "The mountain" must be Lebanon. But surely the <span class="accented">stone</span> was not transported, to any great extent, like the wood, so great a distance over land and sea, especially when it abounded on the spot. (The tradition that the stone was quarried at Baalbek is quite unworthy of credence. It has no doubt sprung from the huge stones found there. "The temple was built of the beautiful white stone of the country, the hard <span class="accented">missal"</span> (Warren, p. 60.) It is true the number of wood cutters would thus appear to be very great, but it is to be remembered how few comparatively were the appliances or machines of those days: almost everything must be done by manual labour. And Pliny tells us that no less than 360,000 men were employed for twenty years on one of the pyramids. It is possible, however, that the huge foundations mentioned below (ver. 17) were brought from Lebanon.]

Ewald, Hist. Israel, 3:233). Porter holds that they are "coeval with the oldest part of the external walls." Many of them, the writer observed, were monoliths. The extensive vaults which they enclose are unquestionably "the subterranean vaults of the temple area" mentioned by Josephus (B.J. 5:3. 1), and the <span class="accented">"cavati sub terra montes"</span> of Tacitus.

Indeed, it is not improbable that it was at this port that the land transport ended, and the rafts were made. A road ran anciently from Gebal to Baalbak, so that the transport was not impracticable.
