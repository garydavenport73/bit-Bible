The question is one of some nicety, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour of connecting the title with Azariah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Azariah son of Zadok was the priest." This brings us to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What are we to understand by "the priest " - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>? It is urged by Keil, Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span> that this cannot mean "priest" in the ordinary sense of the word, still less "high priest," for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because the high priests of Solomon are mentioned presently, viz., Abiathar and Zadok, and the Jews never had <span class="accented">three</span> high priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because the Azariah who was high priest under Solomon for the words of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>, "He it is that executed the priest's office," etc, must belong to the Azariah of ver. 9, and have got accidentally misplaced - was the son of Ahimaaz, not of Zadok. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because no grandson of Zadok could then be old enough to sustain the office of high priest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Because in one passage (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>) <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is used of privy councillors and of the sons of <span class="accented">David</span>, who cannot have been sacrificing priests. Keil consequently would understand that Azariah was "administrator of the kingdom, or prime minister." Similarly Bahr. But in favour of the ordinary meaning of the word are these powerful considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> All the versions translate the word by "priest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they understand by the term a spiritual person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Whatever may be the case with <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> priest" (<span class="accented">par excellence</span>) can only be understood of the <span class="accented">high</span> priest (ch. 1:8, 38; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4, 8, 10, 12, 14</a>. Comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is ever used except in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, Rawlinson, who says it sometimes indicates "a civil officer, with perhaps a semi-priestly character," refers to Gesenius <span class="accented">sub hac voce</span>, who, however, distinctly affirms that the word only means priest, and accounts for the application of the term to the sons of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>) on the supposition that the Jews had priests who were not of the tribe of Levi. The question is discussed with great learning by Professor Plumptre (Dict. Bib., art. "Priest"), who suggests that "David and his sons may have been admitted, not to distinctively priestly functions, such as burning incense (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>), but to an honorary, titular priesthood. To wear the ephod in processions (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) at the time when this was the special badge of the order (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>), to join the priests and Levites in their songs and dances, might have been conceded, with no deviation from the Law, to the members of the royal house." There is one difficulty however in the way of accepting this ingenious and otherwise sufficient explanation, namely, that it seems hardly likely that the title of priest would be freely accorded by Hebrew writers to men who were expressly <span class="accented">excluded</span> from all "distinctively priestly functions," especially after the use of the same word in the preceding verse (17) to designate the high priest. And I venture to suggest that the discharge by David's sons of the semi-priestly functions just referred to occasioned so much remark as to head to the application of the term "priest" to them in a special conventional sense; in fact, that it became a sort of <span class="accented">soubriquet</span>, which rather implied that they were <span class="accented">not</span> priests than that they were. (Notice <span class="accented">the order</span> of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, Hebrews) And observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> if we are to understand by "the <span class="accented">priest"</span> in ver. 2, "prime minister;" by <span class="accented">"priests"</span> in ver. 4, "high priests," and by <span class="accented">"priest"</span> in ver 5, "principal officer," language has no certain meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The mention of Azariah as "the priest" in the same list with Zadok and Abiathar is easily accounted for. We know that Abiathar was deposed at the beginning of Solomon's reign (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>), and Zadok must then have been an old man. Their names consequently are  recorded (ver. 4) because they were high priests for a brief period of the reign, but Azariah is mentioned first as "the priest" because he was high priest during most of the time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> "Azariah the <span class="accented">son</span> of Zadok" is quite compatible with the fact that Azariah was really the son of Ahimaaz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is constantly used in the sense of "descendant," and especially "grandson." (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-5.htm">Genesis 29:5</a>: 31:28, 55: and see on ch. 2:8,"the son of Gera.") Zadok is no doubt mentioned as better known than Ahimaaz, and probably because Azariah succeeded him directly in the office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The age of Azariah must be uncertain, and Solomon's reign was a long one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The position of his name - first - accords well with the idea that he was high priest, which I conclude that he was. It is worthy of remark that in the lists of David the military officers of the kingdom occupy the first place; in those of Solomon, the civil and religious dignitaries. "The princes of Solomon are, with one exception (ver. 4) ministers of peace." - Wordsworth.

Now for 1400 chariots the proper allowance of horses would be about 4000. We see from the monuments that it was customary to yoke two horses (seldom three) to a chariot; but a third or supernumerary horse was provided to meet emergencies or accidents. 4000 horses would hence be a liberal provision for Solomon's chariots, and it would also agree well with the number of his cavalry. 12,000 cavalry and 40,000 chariot horses are out of all proportion. As to stalls, it seems clear that in ancient, as in modern times, each horse had a separate crib (Vegetins in Bochart, quoted by Keil).

Not only are the names practically the same (<span class="accented">Dara</span> may well be a clerical error: many MSS., together with the Syr. and Arab., read <span class="accented">Darda</span>), but they occur in the same order. Our first impression, consequently, is that the two lists represent the same persons, and if so, these four sages were the "sons" of Zerah, the son of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a>). But against this it is urged that Ethan is here called the Ezrahite, as are both Ethan and Heman in the titles of <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, and 88. respectively. The resemblance, however, of Ezrahite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) to Zerahite (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is so close as to suggest identity rather than difference. There is, perhaps, more weight in the objection that Chalcol and Darda are here distinctly said to be "the sons of Mahol," though here again it has been observed that Mahol (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means <span class="accented">pipe</span> or <span class="accented">dance</span>, and the "sons of Mahol," consequently, may merely be a synonym, agreeably to Eastern idiom (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>, with which cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>), for "musicians." We may therefore allow that the four names may be those of sons (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, descendants) of Zerah.

The first impression in this case, therefore, is that they <span class="accented">must be</span> distinct. But it should be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the sons - in the strict sense - of Zerah are nowhere else named for their wisdom, whereas the royal singer and seer probably owed their appointments to their genius, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that though Levites, they may have been incorporated (possibly like Jair, through marriage - see note on ver. 13 above, and cf. <a href="../../par/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a>) into the tribe of Judah.
