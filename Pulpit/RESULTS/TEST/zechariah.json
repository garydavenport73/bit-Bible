A connecting link between the last section and the next. The condition for obtaining the promised blessings is that they are to be sought from the Lord, not from idols. Verse 1. - Ask ye of the Lord rain. The promise of abundance at the end of the last chapter suggests to the prophet to make a special application to the practice of his countrymen. They must put their trust in God alone for the supply of temporal as well as spiritual bounties. The latter rain was due at the time of the vernal equinox, and was necessary in order to swell the maturing grain (comp. Deuteronomy 11:14). The early rain occurred at the autumnal equinox. It was considered as a special manifestation of God's providential care that these periodical rains were received (see Isaiah 30:23; Jeremiah 5:24; Joel 2:23). So the Lord shall make bright clouds; rather, Jehovah maketh the lightnings. Thunderstorms accompany the periodical rains. Ye must ask of him, and ye shall have. Septuagint, Κύριος ἐποίησε φαντασίας,\" The Lord makes flashes\" (of lightning?); Vulgate, Domiaus faciet nives, where the right reading is supposed to be nubes (comp. Psalm 135:7; Job 38:25, 26). Give them showers of rain. Abundant rain, as Job 37:6. The address is now in the third person. Grass. All vegetable food for man and beast, as in Genesis 1:11, 29; Psalm 104:14; Amos 7:2.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - For. The prophet supports his exhortation to pray to Jehovah by showing the worthlessness of trust in idols. Idols; teraphim. What these were is not known for certain. They seem to have been images of human form and sometimes of life size, corresponding in some degree to the lares or penates of the Romans (Genesis 31:19; 1 Samuel 19:13). They were supposed to be capable of bestowing temporal blessings and giving oracles (Judges 17:5; Judges 18:5, 24; Ezekiel 21:21). Have spoken vanity. Gave worthless, misleading responses. The mention of teraphim in this passage is thought to indicate a date anterior to the Captivity; but the prophet is speaking of past events, of the results of these base superstitions in former, not present, time. Three kinds of superstition are mentioned. Septuagint, οἱ ἀποφθεγγόμενοι, \"speaking\" images. These are the first. Secondly come the soothsayers, the diviners, persons who pretended to predict the future (Jeremiah 27:9; Jeremiah 29:8; Ezekiel 21:21; Habukkuk 2:18). Have told false dreams; Vulgate, somniatores locuti sunt frustra; LXX., τὰ ἐνύπνια ψευδῆ ἐλάλουν, \"spake false dreams.\" The Vulgate seems to be correct, \"dreams, i.e. dreamers, spake deceit.\" This is the third class among the practisers of superstitious observances. They comfort in vain, when they promise temporal blessings (Job 21:34). Therefore they went their way as a flock. Because they trusted in these vain superstitions, the Israelites had to leave their own place, were led into exile like a flock of sheep driven away for sale or slaughter (Jeremiah 1:17). They were troubled. They were and are still oppressed by the heathen. Because there was (is) no shepherd. Because they had no king to guard and lead them, they fell under the power of foreign rulers, who ill treated and oppressed them (Ezekiel 34:5; Nehemiah 5:15).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3, 4. - § 5. The evil rulers set over them for their sins shall be removed, and Israel shall be firmly established. Ver. 3, - Mine anger was (is) kindled against the shepherds. These heathen rulers were indeed God's instruments in punishing his people, but they had exceeded their commission, and afflicted Israel in order to carry out their own evil designs, and now they themselves shall be chastised. Some commentators raise \"the shepherds\" to be the rulers of Israel civil and ecclesiastical, comparing Ezekiel 34:2, 5, etc. But the context leads us to consider them as those who took the place of rulers of Israel when she had no shepherd of her own (ver. 2). I punished (will punish) the goats (bellwethers); literally, will visit upon; i.e. will chastise. The same word (paquad) is used in the next clause in a good sense. The \"goats\" are the leading men, those powerful for evil, as Isaiah 14:9. Hath visited his flock. The reason why the evil shepherds are punished is because God visits his flock in love and care, to see their state and to relieve them from trouble (Zephaniah 2:7). The house of Judah here includes all the nation, to which it afterwards gave its name. Hath made (shall make) them as his goodly horse. The Israelites shall not only be delivered from oppression, but God shall use them as a stately war horse, richly caparisoned, to tread down enemies and triumph ever them. So he said before (Zechariah 9:13) that he would make Judah his bow and Ephraim his arrow. (For a description of the war horse, see Job 39:19-25; comp. Revelation 6:2; Revelation 19:14, where Christ is represented riding on a white horse, and his saints following him on white horses.)NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOut of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The firmness and security of Judah, thus \"visited,\" is announced in terms admitting of further application. Out of him came forth (shall come). Out of Judah, mentioned in ver. 3. Others, not so suitably, explain, \"out of Jehovah,\" in contrast to Hosea 8:4. The succeeding figures are taken from the building and furnishing of a house. The corner. The cornerstone (Isaiah 28:16). From Judah herself shall come the prince on whom the whole edifice shall rest; i.e. primarily, she shall be independent of foreign rulers; and secondly, from Judah shall come the Messiah, \"the Headstone of the corner\" (Matthew 21:42; Ephesians 2:20; Hebrews 7:14). Septuagint (taking the noun as a verb), καὶ ἀπ αὐτοῦ ἐπέβλεψε, \"et ex ipso respexit\" (Jerome). The nail. The word (yathed) is taken for the peg that fastens the cord of a tent, for a nail used in building with timber, or a peg for hanging up arms and utensils on the walls of a house. In whichever sense we take it here, it implies one who consolidates or upholds the political constitution (Isaiah 22:23, 24). The battle bow. The people shall themselves have arms and military skill to protect them against all assailants. Oppressor; rather, ruler, as Isaiah 3:12; Isaiah 60:17. Judah shall have every leader necessary for all emergencies. Septuagint, πᾶς ὁ ἐξελαύνων ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ, \"he that expelleth together;\" Vulgate, omnis exactor simul. If the word be taken in the sense of these versions and the Authorized Version, the clause would mean that the Israelites shall subjugate their enemies, and oppress them, and exact tribute from them. The word (noges) usually means \"taskmaster.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-7. - § 6. Thus equipped, Israel and Judah united shall triumph over their foes. Verse 5. - Which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets. \"Their enemies\" is supplied naturally from the context. Others take the participle \"treading\" intransitively, \"treading upon street mire,\" the enemy being figuratively denoted by \"mire.\" The Greek and Latin Versions give, \"treading the mud in the streets\" (comp. Psalm 18:42; Micah 7:10). They shall fight. They shall carry on long continued war successfully because God is with them. The riders on horses. The strong force of cavalry arrayed against them shall fall before Israel, and be put to shame. The Israelite forces were for the most part infantry, while the principal strength of their enemies consisted in cavalry (Daniel 11:40).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - House of Joseph; i.e. Israel, or the ten tribes, called Ephraim in the next verse (see note on Amos 5:6). Israel and Judah alike shall share in the contest and the victory, under the protection of God. I will bring them again to place them. This is one word in Hebrew, which may mean either \"I bring them again,\" or \"I make them dwell.\" The Authorized Version unwarrantably combines both significations. Septuagint, κατοικιῶ αὐτούς, \"I will settle them;\" Vulgate, convertam eos. It is better taken here, in contrast with \"cast off\" in a following clause, in the sense of \"I will cause them to dwell,\" i.e. in safety and comfort. As though I had not cast them off. The happy restoration shall make thrum forget former troubles and the calamities of their rejection (Isaiah 43:18, 19). Will hear them (Zechariah 13:9; Isaiah 58:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - They of Ephraim; i.e. as well as Judah, shall be heroes. Not many members of the northern kingdom returned at first from the Captivity; but the prophet gives the assurance that they shall come and prove themselves mighty warriors. As through wine. They shall hasten to the battle cheerfully and exultingly, like men refreshed and strengthened with wine (see Zechariah 9:15; Psalm 78:65, 66). Their children shall see it. Though unable to participate in the struggle, their children shall share the universal joy. Their heart shall rejoice in the Lord (Psalm 63:7; Isaiah 41:16; Joel 2:23; Habakkuk 3:18). Attempts have been made to find the fulfilment of these prophecies (ver. 3, etc.) in certain events of Maccabean times. Thus, according to Patritius, the sin for which the Hebrews surfeited such distress at the hands of the Seleucidae (ver. 2) was their imitation of heathen practices mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:13-15 and 2 Macc. 4:7-17, when the high priest purchased his office by a bribe, and the other priests followed Greek customs. The prophet is supposed to refer specially to this state of things when he says, \"They were troubled because there was no shepherd. Mine auger was kindled against the shepherds.\" But we have shown above that Zechariah is here speaking of the past, not of the future. There is more verisimilitude in discerning the wars and victories of Judas, his brothers and successors, in the allusions of vers 4-7. The truth is that such descriptions suit many different events, and have various applications. Though their complete fulfilment may be expected only in Messianic times and circumstances, yet we may see many anticipatory and preparative transactions, which are meant to introduce the final accomplishment. The Jewish prophet is not always foretelling certain definite events. Oftentimes he is teaching, warning, and exhorting; and generally he is enunciating great principles, the truth of which shall be clear in the future, rather than predicting particular facts. Not unfrequently commentators have neglected this consideration, and sought too curiously to restrict the prophet's words to some one issue. It may be noted, further, that where the prophetic language concerning the destiny of the restored people seems to be exaggerated and not borne out by subsequent facts, the promises are always conditioned by the moral state of the recipients. If they answered fully and consistently to God's call, the result would be such as was predicted. That the event in all respects did not correspond with the high ideal previously announced must be attributed, not to the prophet's mistake, but to the people's waywardness and disobedience.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-12. - § 7. The scattered people shall be gathered from all parts of the world, and dwell in their own land, under the protection of Jehovah. Verse 8. - I will him for them; σημανῶ αὐτοῖς,\" I will signal to them\" (Septuagint); sibilabo eis (Vulgate). The slightest summons will bring them when God wills the return of the dispersed. The \"hissing\" is the whistling or tinkling with which bees are allured to swarm (Isaiah 5:26; Isaiah 7:18, 19). I have redeemed them. They were virtually delivered from captivity and exile, though all had not taken advantage of the deliverance. They shall increase as they have increased. The same promise is made in Ezekiel 36:10, 11. The allusion is to the marvellous growth of the Israelite nation in Egypt (Exodus 1:7, 12). The prophets often announce this fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham (Genesis 13:16; Genesis 15:5, etc.) after the return (see Isaiah 54:2; Hosea 1:10; Micah 2:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will sow them among the people (peoples). The \"sowing\" here does not mean scattering, but increase, and this was to go on while they were dispersed among the nations. The word is used in the same sense in Hosea 2:23; Jeremiah 31:27. This continued dispersion was a part of their discipline, a test of their loyalty to God. They shall remember me. In the countries where they are living they shall worship the Lord and observe his Law, and be a witness for him among the heathen. They shall live with their children (Ezekiel 37:14). The promised blessing is not for a time only, but perpetual. Turn again; i.e. return to their own land (Isaiah 35:10). It cannot mean, \"turn to the Lord,\" for they are said already to remember the Lord, and their \"conversion must precede the promise of life.\" The next verse describes the return more particularly.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Egypt... Assyria. It is certain that there was a large body of Jews in Egypt at this time (Jeremiah 43:6, 7); and to Assyria the ten tribes, who are here specially mentioned under the name Ephraim, had been deported. Besides this, Assyria is often used loosely for Western Asia or Babylonia, of which, after its submission, it formed a most important feature (see 2 Kings 23:29; Ezra 6:22; and in the Apocrypha, 1 Esdr. 7:15; Judith 1:7 Judith 2:1). In the 'Oracula Sibyllina,' the Assyrians are continually confused with Persians, Babylonians, and other Eastern nations. Egypt and Assyria are here used as types of the countries to which Jews had been banished (comp. Hosea 11:11). Gilead and Lebanon. A designation of the northern district of Palestine, on both sides of the Jordan, in which these tribes had been originally settled. This region had been most exposed to hostile attacks, and was the first to be depopulated. Place shall not be found for them (Isaiah 49:20). Josephus testifies to the teeming population of Galilee in later times ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:03, 1; 3:3, 2; 4:1, 2; 7:5). Septuagint, \"There shall not even one of them be left behind,\" i.e. in exile.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - He shall pass through the sea with affliction. In bringing his people back the Lord is ready to repeat the miracles of the Exodus. This is the general meaning of the passage; but the details present difficulties. For \"he shall pass\" the LXX. gives, \"they shall pass through.\" But the reference is plainly to Jehovah, as the following clause shows. The next two words are in apposition, \"the sea,\" \"affliction.\" Revised Version, \"the sea of affliction;\" Septuagint,  ᾿ν θαλάσσῃ στενῇ, \"in a strait sea;\" or, as the Hebrew cannot be so translated, \"in a sea, a strait;\" Vulgate, in maris freto. It seems best to take the two words simply as, \"the sea, which is affliction.\" The Red Sea, through which Jehovah led his people, was a figure of the sufferings which they had endured in Egypt, and brought destruction upon their enemies (comp. Exodus 14:16, 17, 24, etc.). Smite the waves (Exodus 15:8; Isaiah 11:15, 16; Isaiah 51:10). The river. The Nile. The drying up of the waters of the Nile is a figure of the humiliation of the nations which have been guilty of enslaving the chosen people. The Nile. the representative of Egypt, is mentioned because of the allusion to the bondage in Egypt running through the paragraph. The pride of Assyria. Pride is noted as the characteristic of Assyria (comp. Isaiah 10:7, etc.; Ezekiel 31:3, 10). The sceptre. This may refer to the decadence of the power of Egypt, and the transference of royal authority to strangers; but, regarding the immediate context, we had better translate, \"the rod of Egypt,\" and see in it an allusion to the oppression of the taskmasters during the sojourn in that land. All such tyranny shall be at an end (comp. Isaiah 10:24).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah10:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I will strengthen them in the Lord. I will strengthen them with myself - with my grace and power. They shall walk up and down in his Name. They shall live in obedience to, and dependence upon, the Lord (Micah 4:5, where see note). The Septuagint reads, \"They shall boast themselves.\" So God will work wonders to deliver his people from the captivity of the devil, destroying all enemies, visible and invisible, which array themselves against him. This is the final fulfilment of the prophecy. The complete restoration from the Captivity is the immediate subject of the prophet's words; and between these two we may see a reference to the conversion of the Jews in the time of Christ and the apostles, which shall go on until the end.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.11":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTOpen thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - Open thy doors, O Lebanon. The prophet graphically portrays the punishment that is to fall upon the people. The sin that occasions this chastisement, viz. the rejection of their Shepherd and King, is denounced later (§ 9). Lebanon stood in the path of an invader from the north, whence most hostile armies entered Palestine. The \"doors\" of Lebanon are the mountain passes which gave access to the country. Some commentators, following an old Jewish interpretation, take Lebanon to mean the temple or Jerusalem; but we are constrained to adhere primarily to the literal signification by the difficulty of carrying on the metaphorical allusions in the following clauses. That the fire may devour thy cedars. That the invader may wantonly destroy thy trees which are thy glory and thy boast.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHowl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Howl, fir tree. A species of cypress is intended, or, as some say, the Aleppo pine. It is the tree of which Solomon made floors, doom, and ceiling in his temple (1 Kings 6:15, 34), and David harps (2 Samuel 6:5). The prophet dramatically calls on this tree to wail for the fate of the cedar, as being about to suffer the same destruction. The mighty; μεγιστᾶνες, \"the chieftains\" (Septuagint). Trees are being spoken of, and so the primary sense is, \"the goodly\" (Ezekiel 17:23) or \"glorious trees.\" Metaphorically, the chiefs of Israel may be intended. Bashan, famous for its oaks, is next visited by the invading force, and its trees are felled for the use of the enemy. The forest of the vintage. The Authorized Version here follows, very inappropriately, the correction of the Keri. The original reading should be retained and translated, \"the inaccessible forest\" - an expression appropriate to Lebanon. If Lebanon is not spared, much less shall Bashan escape. LXX., ὁ δρυμὸς ὁ σύμφυτος, \"the close-planted wood;\" Vulgate, saltus munitus, \"defenced forest.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThere is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - There is a voice. The Hebrew is more terse and forcible, \"A voice of the howling of the shepherds!\" or, \"Hark! a howling,\" etc. (Jeremiah 25:34, etc.). The destruction spreads from the north southwards along the Jordan valley. Their glory. The noble trees in whose shadow they rejoiced. Young lions. Which had their lairs in the forests now laid waste (Jeremiah 49:19). The pride of Jordan. The thickets that clothed the banks of Jordan are called its \"pride\" (Jeremiah 12:5). The lion is not now found in Palestine, but must have been common in earlier times, especially in such places as the brushwood and reedy coverts which line the margin of the Jordan. The prophet introduces the inanimate and animate creation - trees, men, beasts - alike deploring the calamity. And the terms in which this is depicted point to some great disaster and ruin, and, as it seems, to the final catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the punishment of the rejection of Messiah. This reference becomes plainer as we proceed. It is inadmissible to refer the passage (as some do) to the Assyrian invasions mentioned in 2 Kings 15:29 and 1 Chronicles 5:26. Holding the post-exilian origin of the prophecy, we are bound to interpret it in accordance with this view, which, indeed, presents fewer difficulties than the other.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 4-14. - § 9. The punishment falls upon the people of Israel because they reject the good Shepherd, personified by the prophet, who rules the flock and chastises evildoers in vain, and at last flings up his office in indignation at their contumacy. Verse 4. - Thus saith the Lord. The person addressed is Zechariah himself, who in a vision is commanded to assume the office of the good Shepherd (see ver. 15), and to tend the chosen people, the sheep of the Lord's pasture. God herein designs to show his care for his people from the earliest times amid the various trials which have beset them both from external enemies and from unworthy rulers at home. The flock of the slaughter; rather, the flock of slaughter - destined for, exposed to, destruction at the hands of their present shepherds (Psalm 44:22; Jeremiah 12:3; Romans 8:36).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Possessors; or, buyers. Those who claimed to be owners by right of purchase. Hold themselves not guilty. They are so blinded by self-interest that they see no sin in thus treating the flock. But the expression is better rendered, bear no blame, i.e. suffer no penalty, commit this wickedness with impunity. Septuagint, \"repent not;\" Vulgate, non dolebant, which Jerome explains, \"did not suffer for it.\" Blessed be the Lord. So little compunction do they feel that they actually thank God for their ill-gotten gains. The prophet is speaking of chiefs and rulers, civil and ecclesiastical, who played into the enemies' hands, and thought of nothing but how to make a gain of the subject people. Our Lord denounces such untrustworthy shepherds (John 10:11-13). Doubtless, too, the expressions in the text refer to the foreign powers which had oppressed the Jews at various times, Egypt, Assyria, etc. Amid all such distresses, from whatever cause, God still had tender care for his people, and punished and will punish their enemies. In this verse the offenders against Israel are of three classes - buyers, sellers, shepherds (see ver. 8). \"Shepherd\" appears sometimes in the Assyrian inscriptions as a synonym for \"prince\" (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 453) :NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The inhabitants of the land. It is a question whether by this expression is meant the Israelites, or the dwellers on earth generally. In the former ease, the verso gives the reason of the calamities depicted in ver. 5, viz. God's displeasure, and expounds the parable of the sheep as meaning men (so Cheyne). In the other case, the signification of the paragraph is that God intends to put an end to the state of things just described, by punishing the oppressing world powers who had so cruelly executed their office of being instruments of God's judgment on his people. The latter seems the correct exposition; for the people of Israel have just been called the flock of slaughter, and they were to be fed, while these \"inhabitants\" are to be destroyed; nor could the Israelites be said to have kings, as just below. Thus for, at the beginning of the verse, introduces the reason why Jehovah tells the shepherd to feed the flock, because he is about to punish their oppressors; and \"the inhabitants of the land\" should be \"the inhabitants of the earth;\" i.e. the nations of the world, among whom the Israelites lived. I will deliver the men, etc. God will give up the nations to intestine commotions and civil war, so that they shall fall by mutual slaughter. Into the hand of his king. Each of them shall be delivered over helpless unto their tyrant's hands, and God will not interpose to succour them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - And I will feed. Thus the Greek and Latin Versions; but it should be, So I fed. It is the account of what the prophet did in accordance with the command in ver. 4 (see the end of this verse, \"and I fed\"). Even you, O poor of the flock. There is difficulty about the word rendered \"you\" (lachen) which may be the personal pronoun, or an adverb meaning \"therefore,\" \"therewith,\" \"truly,\" or a preposition, \"on account of;\" Vulgate, propter hoc. The best rendering is, I fed the flock therefore the poor among the flock. \"Therefore\" refers to the previous command. It is also rendered \"in sooth.\" The LXX., arranging the letters differently, translates, Ποιμανῶ τὰ πρόβατα τῆς σφαγῆς εἰς τὴν Ξαναανίτιν \"I will go and tend the flock of slaughter in the land of Canaan;\" some render the last words, \"for the merchants.\" This Jerome interprets to mean that the Lord will nourish the Israelites for slaughter in the land of the Gentiles (but see note on ver. 6). And I took unto me two staves. Executing in vision his commission of feeding the flock, the prophet, as the representative of the Shepherd, took two shepherd's staves. The two staves intimate the manifold care of God for his flock from the earliest days, and the two blessings which he designed to bestow (as the names of the staves show), favour and unity. Beauty; Κάλλος (Septuagint); Decorem (Vulgate); \"Graciousness\" (Revised Version margin). It probably means the favour and grace of God, as in Psalm 90:17. Bands; literally, Those that bind; Σχοίνισμα, \"Cord;\" Vulgate, Funiculum. The name is meant to express the union of all the members of the flock, especially that between Israel and Judah (see ver. 14). These make one flock under one shepherd. I fed the flock. This repetition emphasizes the beginning of the verse, and expresses God's ears in time past and in time to come also.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThree shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In executing the office of feeding the flock, three shepherds also I out off in one month; Septuagint, \"And I will take away the three shepherds in one month.\" The article in the Hebrew and Greek seems to point to some known shepherds, three in number, unless we take it as \"threes of the shepherds.\" Hence expositors have sought to find historical personages to whom the term might apply. Those who assert a pre-exilian origin for this part of the prophecy, suggest the three kings, Zachariah, Shallum, and Menahem; or, as Menahem reigned ten years, some unrecorded pretender, who started up at the time. Others see some Syrian monarchs in Maccabean times; or the three offices, king, prophet, priest; or the three dynasties that oppressed Israel, viz. the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and Macedonian. All these interpretations fail in some point; and we are reduced to see herein a reference, as Cheyne says, to \"the prompt and vigorous action of Jehovah's Shepherd in dealing with the evil shepherds, as well as in feeding the flock;\" the number three being used indefinitely. Or we may find in this number an allusion to the three classes in ver. 5 - the buyers, the sellers, and the pitiless shepherds. The oppressors, external and internal, are removed and cut off in one month. To the prophet's eye all this seemed to take place in that short space of time. If anything more is intended, we may, with Keil and others, taking the month as consisting of thirty days, assume that ten days are assigned to the destruction of each shepherd, after each had fulfilled his allotted period - the number ten expressing perfection or completion. And my soul loathed them; literally, but my soul was straitened for them; i.e. was impatient, weary of them. These words begin a new paragraph, and refer, not to the three shepherds, but to the sheep, the Israelites. The prophet now shows how ill the people had responded to God's manifold care, and mingles with the past a view of their future ingratitude and disobedience which will bring upon them final ruin. God, as it were, was weary of their continual backslidings and obstinate perseverance in evil. (For the phrase, see Numbers 21:4; Judges 16:16; Job 21:4.) It is the opposite to long suffering. Their soul also abhorred me. They showed their abhorrence by their devotion to idols and their disinclination for all goodness.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will not feed you. In consequence of their contumacy, the shepherd abandons the flock to their fate, as God threatened (Deuteronomy 31:17; comp. the very similar passage in Jeremiah 15:1-3). Three scourges are intimated in the succeeding words - plague, war, famine, combined with civil strife. Eat every one the flesh of another (comp. Isaiah 9:20). Many see here a reference to the awful scenes enacted when Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans, and intestine feuds filled the city with bloodshed and added to the horrors of famine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Cut it asunder. The breaking of the staff \"Beauty\" indicates that God withdraws his grace and protection; he will no longer shield the people from the attack of foes, as the following words express. My covenant which I had made with all the people; rather, with all the peoples. God calls the restriction which he had laid on foreign nations to prevent them from afflicting Israel, \"a covenant.\" Similar \"covenants,\" i.e. restraints imposed by God, are found in Job 5:23; Hosea 2:20 (Hosea 2:18, Authorized Version); Ezekiel 34:25, etc. The restraint being removed, there ensued war, exile, the destruction of the kingdom and theocracy, the subjection of Israel to Gentile nations.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - It was broken. The covenant just mentioned (ver. 10) was broken. And so the poor of the flock that waited upon me (that gave heed unto me) know. The punishment inflicted on the withdrawal of God's protection had some good result. Though the bulk of the nation took no heed, learned no lesson, yet the humble and the suffering among them, who paid respect to his words, recognized that what happened was according to God's Word, and knew that all the rest would be fulfilled in due season. This was the effect of the Captivity; it forced the Israelites to see the hand of the Lord in the calamities that had befallen them, and it drove the thoughtful among them to repentance and amendment (Jeremiah 3:13, 23; Daniel 9:8, etc.). The breaking asunder of the first staff refers primarily to the time of the exile, and not to the absolute relinquishment of the flock. One staff is left, and for a time utter destruction is postponed. For \"the poor,\" the LXX. reads, as in ver. 7, \"the Cananeans,\" meaning probably \"merchants.\" Ewald and others, who hold the pre-exilian date of this prophecy, see here an allusion to the invasion of the Assyrians under Pul (2 Kings 15:19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - I said. The prophet is speaking in the person of the great Shepherd. Unto them. Unto the whole flock. Give me my price; my wages. He asks his hire of the flock, because the flock represents men. Acting far differently from the wicked shepherds, he used no violence or threats. He gives them this last opportunity of showing their gratitude for all the care bestowed upon them, and their appreciation of his tenderness and love. The wages God looked for were repentance, faith, obedience, or, in another view, themselves, their life and soul. It was for their sake he required these, not for his own. If not, forbear. He speaks with indignation, as conscious of their ungrateful contempt. Pay me what is due, or pay me not. I leave it to you to decide. I put no constraint upon you. So God has given us free will; and we can receive or reject his offers, as we are minded. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. This paltry remuneration displayed the people's ingratitude and contempt. It was the compensation offered by the Law to a master for the loss of a slave that had been killed (Exodus 21:82). It was, perhaps, double the pries of a female slave (Hosea 3:2); and the very offer of such a sum was an insult, and, says Dr. Alexander, \"suggested an intention to compass his death. They despised his goodness; they would have none of his service; they sought to cut him off; and they were ready to pay the penalty which the Law prescribed for the murder of one of so mean a condition.\" The word \"weigh\" was used in money transactions even after the use of coined money rendered weighing unnecessary.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord said unto me. The Lord takes the insult as offered to himself in the person of his representative. Cast it unto the potter; Κάθες αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸ χωνευ τήριον, \"Lay them in the foundry, and I will see if it is approved;\" Vulgate; Projice illud ad statuarium; the Syriac and Targum have, \"Put it into the treasury\" (Malachi 3:10). This involves an alteration of the text, and is in itself an improbable reading, as God could not be made to tell the prophet to throw this despicable wage into his treasury, unless, perchance, it is said ironically. There may be an undesigned coincidence here. In Matthew 27:5 the council discuss the propriety of putting the thirty pieces of silver into the treasury. But taking our present text as genuine, commentators usually consider the phrase as a proverbial expression for contemptuous treatment; as the Greeks said, ἐς κόρακας, as the Germans say, \"zum Schinder,\" \"to the knacker,\" and we, \"to the dogs.\" There is, however, no trace elsewhere of any such proverb, nor do we know how it could have arisen; it likewise does not very well suit the last clause of the verse, \"I cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.\" If we substitute the supposed analogous expression, \"I threw them to the dogs,\" we see how unseemly would be the proverb in this connection. The rendering of the Jews in old time, adopted recently by Knabenbauer, \"Cast them to the Creator,\" is considered by Dr. Pusey to be unidiomatic, and involves great difficulties. It seems simpler to consider that the command, \"cast it to the potter,\" implies contemptuous rejection of the sum, and at the same time intimates the ultimate destination to which, in the sight of Omniscience, it was directed. The potter is named as the workman who makes the meanest utensils out of the vilest material. That this was ordered and executed in vision is plain; how much the prophet understood we cannot tell. The ambiguous and highly typical order was explained and fulfilled to the letter by the action of Judas Iscariot, as the evangelist testifies (Matthew 27:5-10). A (the) goodly price, etc. This is ironical, of course. Such was the price at which they estimated the good Shepherd's services. Cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord. This rejection of the paltry wage took place in the house of the Lord (in the vision), because the insult had been really offered to him, and this was the natural place where oblations would be made; thus the transaction was represented as formal and national. Whether the potter was seen in the temple we know not. The prophet was made to connect him in some way with the business; and we learn from the fulfilment that the potter did in the end receive the money, which was paid for his field applied to an unclean purpose. In Matthew 27:9 the two verses, 12, 13, with some variations, are quoted as \"spoken by Jeremy the prophet.\" Hence some attribute this part of Zechariah to Jeremiah; and others think that in St. Matthew the present name is a mistake. The probability is that the evangelist did not name any prophet, but that some early transcriber, remembering the purchase of the field in Jeremiah 32:6-12, attributed the quotation to that prophet. Or we may suppose that inspiration did not extend to all minor details, nor save the writers from unimportant errors.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I eat asunder mine other staff. As the flock, by their contemptuous payment, showed their alienation from the Shepherd, so he now, by his symbolical action, shows his rejection of them, and his surrender of them to anarchy, confusion, and ruin. The breaking of the first staff indicated that God withdrew his defensive care; the breaking of the staff called \"Bands\" signifies the utter dissolution of all the bends that held the nation together, the civil and social disunion that paved the way for the victory of the Romans, and issued in the final disruption which sent the Jews wandering through the world. This in the vision is represented as the breaking of the brotherhood between Judah and Israel, the component parts of the nation. Thus was hinted the ultimate rejection of the Jews in consequence of their treatment of Christ, the good Shepherd, who came unto his own, and his own received him not (comp. Matthew 23:36-38). This doom is declared more fully in the next section.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 15-17. - § 10. In retribution for their rejection of the good Shepherd the people are given over to a foolish shepherd, who shall destroy them, but shall himself, in turn, perish miserably. Verse 15. - Take unto thee yet (yet again) the instruments of a foolish shepherd (comp. Hosea 3:1). The prophet, in vision, is directed to do as he had done before (ver. 4, etc,), and enact the part of a shepherd, taking the dress, scrip, and crook, which were appropriate to the character; but this time he was to represent \"a foolish,\" i.e. an evil, shepherd; for sin is constantly denoted by \"folly\" in the Old Testament; e.g. Job 5:2, 3; Psalm 14:1; Psalm 107:17; Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 7:22; Proverbs 14:9, etc. (comp. ver. 17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - I will raise up a shepherd in the land. God explains the reason of the symbolical character which he directed the prophet to assume. He was going to allow the people to be chastised by an instrument whom he would permit to work his will upon them. As this evil shepherd was to arise to punish them for their rejection of Messiah, he must represent some person or power that existed subsequent to Christ's death. Many consider that he symbolizes the Romans; but these people could not be deemed to exercise pastoral care over the Israelites, nor could their neglect of this (ver. 17) be attributed to them as a sin; nor, again, did their destruction follow upon the overthrow of the Jewish polity (ver. 18). Others see here a prediction of the coming of antichrist; but the character of \"shepherd\" does not suit his attributes as given elsewhere; at any rate. this cannot be the primary reference of the symbol, though all evil powers that oppose the Church of Christ are in some sense images and anticipations of antichrist. The genuine reference here is to the native chiefs and rulers (\"in the land\") who arose in the later times of the nation - monsters like Herod, false Christs and false prophets (Matthew 24:5, 11, 12, 24; Mark 13:22), hirelings who made merchandise of the flock, teachers who came in their own name (John 5:43), and deceived the people to their destruction. Which shall not visit those that be cut off; or, those that are perishing. This foolish shepherd shall perform none of the offices of a good shepherd; he will not care for and tend those that are in danger of death (Jeremiah 23:2). The young one; rather, those that are scattered; Septuagint, τὸ ἐσκορπισμένον: Vulgate, dispersum (Matthew 18:12). That that is broken. Bruised, or with limb fractured. Feed that that standeth still; literally, that standeth; i.e. is sound and healthy. This shepherd attended neither to the diseased nor to the healthy sheep. Septuagint, τὸ δλόκληρον, \"that which is whole.\" He shall eat the flesh of the fat. He thinks only how to get personal advantage from the flock (comp. Ezekiel 34:2-8). Tear their claws (hoofs) in pieces, as some say, by making them traverse rough places, and not caring where he led them; but as such travelling would not specially injure sheep, and as the immediate context is concerned with their treatment as food, it is better to see here a picture of a greedy and voracious man who tears asunder the very hoofs to suck out all the nourishment he can find, or one who mutilates the fattest of his flock, that they may not stray, and that he may always have a dainty morsel at hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah11:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWoe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Woe to the idol shepherd! rather, woe to the worthless shepherd! literally, shepherd of vanity, or nothingness, as Job 13:4, \"physicians of no value.\" The LXX., recognizing that no special shepherd is signified, renders, Ω οἱ ποιμαίνοντες τὰ μάταια, \"Alas for those who tend vanities!\" St. Jerome, expounding the verse of antichrist, \"O pastor, et idolum!\" That leaveth the flock. Thus Christ speaks of the hireling (John 10:12). The sword shall be upon his arm, etc. The punishment denounced is in accordance with the neglect of the shepherd's duties. The sword represents the instrument of punishment, whatever it he; the right eye, the severity of the retribution (1 Samuel 11:2). The arm that ought to have defended the flock shall be withered up as by catalepsy; the eye that should have watched for their safety shall be blinded. This is the judgment on the foolish shepherd. Ewald thinks that the passage Zechariah 13:7-9 is out of place there, and belonged originally to the end of the, present chapter.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.12":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-ch. 14:21. - B. THE SECOND BURDEN. Verses 1-9. - § 1. The prophet proceeds to announce Israel's conflict with heathen powers. Hostile nations gather together against Jerusalem, but shall themselves be overthrown; for the people and their leaders, trusting in the Lord, overcome all opposition. Verse 1. - The burden of the word of the Lord for (concerning) Israel. This is the title of the second oracle, corresponding to that at the head of ch. 9. Though the literal Israel has been rejected, as we saw in the last \"burden,\" a new people of God. arises (Hosea 1:10), the Messianic theocracy, which is also called Israel, whose fortunes the prophet herein delineates, describing its probation, its contests, triumph, and development. The body is like its Head; as the good Shepherd, Christ, was persecuted and rejected, so his members, the true Israelites, suffer at the hand of the world and Satan, before they are finally glorified. Some critics suppose that \"Israel\" here is written by mistake for \"Jerusalem,\" as possibly in Jeremiah 23:6 (see note on Zechariah 1:19). It is best to put a full stop after \"Israel,\" and begin a new sentence with \"Thus saith the Lord,\" or \"The saying of Jehovah.\" Which stretcheth forth the heavens, etc. (comp. Isaiah 42:5; Amos 4:13). The attributes of God. are mentioned here that all may believe that what he has promised, that he is able to perform. He is not only the Creator, but also the Pro-server of all things (Psalm 104:2-4; Hebrews 1:10. Formeth the spirit of man within him. God creates the souls of men, and moulds and guides them. In life and death men work out his purposes (Numbers 16:22; Hebrews 12:9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - A cup of trembling; a bowl of reeling - a bowl whose contents cause staggering and reeling, ὡς πρόθυρα σαλευόμενα, \"as tottering porticoes\" (Septuagint); superliminare crapulae (Vulgate). This Jerome explains to mean that any one who crosses the threshold of Jerusalem in hostile guise shall totter and fall. Jerusalem is the capital and type of the Messianic theocracy; the hostile powers of the world crowd round her, like thirsting men round a bowl of wine; but they find the drought is fatal to them; they stagger back discomfited and destroyed. The figure of the cup and drunkenness is often employed to denote the judgment of God upon transgressors, which makes them incapable of defence or escape (comp. Isaiah 51:17; Jeremiah 25:15, etc.; Jeremiah 51:39, 57; Habakkuk 2:16). The people; the peoples (so vers. 3, 4, 6). The heathen nations who war against God's people. When they shall be in the siege, etc. This gives a good sense, but the Hebrew will not allow it. Septuagint, Ἐν τῇ Ἰουδαίᾳ ἔσται περιοχὴ ἐπὶ Ἱερουσαλήμ, \"In Judaea there shall be a blockade against Jerusalem;\" Vulgate, Sed et Juda erit in obsidione contra Jerusalem, which may mean that Judah shall be among those that besiege Jerusalem, or when Jerusalem is beset Judah shall suffer the same calamity. Pusey and Revised Version render, \"And upon Judah also shall it [i.e. 'the burden'] be in the siege against Jerusalem.\" Cheyne, \"And also on [or, 'over '] Judah it [i.e. the protection and deliverance implied in the first clause of the verse] shall be, in the siege,\" etc. Any interpretation of the passage which makes Judah join with the enemy in attacking Jerusalem is precluded by the very intimate union between Judah and Jerusalem denoted in vers. 4-7, and by the hostility of the nations against Judah. Cheyne's explanation is hardly a natural one, however suitable. Lowe ('Hebr. Stud. Comm.') renders, \"And also on Judah [shall fall this reeling] during the siege [which is to take place] against Jerusalem.\" It seems best to render, with Alexander, \"Also against Judah shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem,\" i.e. not only the mother city, but all the country, shall be exposed to hostile invasion. This suits ver. 5, where the chieftains of Judah are represented as trusting in the valour of the inhabitants of Jerusalem when they are incurring the same danger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3 - A burdensome stone. Jerusalem shall prove to all the nations that attack it a weight not only too heavy to lift, but one which, itself remaining unhurt, shall wound and injure those who attempt to carry it. Jerome supposes here an allusion to a custom in the towns of Palestine, which prevailed to his day (and, indeed, in Syria even now), of placing round stones of great weight at certain distances, by lifting which the youths tested their bodily strength. But we do not know that this custom existed in Zcehariah's time, and the nations are not gathered together for amusement or display of strength, but for hostile attack. Septuagint, λίθον καταπατούμενον, \"a stone trodden down,\" which reminds one of Luke 21:24, Ἱερουσαλὴμ ἔσται πατουμένη ὑπὸ ἐθνῶν. Shall be cut in pieces; i.e. by the sharp edges of the stone, or, as the Revised Version, shall be sore wounded. Though; rather, and; Septuagint, καὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται: Vulgate, et colligentur.

Cavalry represents the forces of the enemy. Astonishment, madness, and blindness are threatened against Israel in Deuteronomy 28:28; here they arc inflicted on the enemy. Madness. The riders should be so panic stricken that they knew not what they did, and shall turn their arms against each other (Haggai 2:22). Open mine eyes upon the house of Judah; i.e. will regard with favour and protect (Deuteronomy 11:12; 1 Kings 8:29; Isaiah 32:8). With blindness. They shall be blinded with terror.

Instead of \"first,\" a preferable reading, supported by the Greek, Latin, and Syriac Versions, is \"as in the beginning,\" or \"as in former days.\" The prophet declares that the open towns and villages of Judah, which can offer no effectual resistance to an enemy like the fortified city Jerusalem, shall be saved by the aid of God, as so often has happened in old time. If \"first\" be the genuine reading, the meaning is that the country people shall first be saved in order to prevent Jerusalem glorifying herself at their expense. That the glory...do not magnify themselves against (be not magnified above) Judah. God will save the chosen nation in such a manner that each part shall have its share in the glory and honour. The leaders, represented by \"the house of David\" and \"the inhabitants of Jerusalem,\" as the sanctuary of Cod and a strongly fortified city, shall not be able to exalt themselves as more favoured than the rest of the people. By God's help alone is the victory won, and all alike share in this.

Psalm 18:32). The house of David shall be as God (Elohim). The chiefs of the theocracy shall be endowed with supernatural might, the expression, \"as God,\" being explained in the next clause. Septuagint, ὡς οϊκος Θεοῦ, \"as the house of God,\" as if it were of the heavenly family. The translators seem to have thought the genuine expression too unqualified. As the angel of the Lord before them. Even as the angel of the Lord, who led the Israelites in all their wanderings (comp. Exodus 14:19; Exodus 23:20; Exodus 32:34; Joshua 5:13).

There shall ensue an outpouring of God's Spirit upon Israel, which shall produce a great national repentance. Verse 10. - I will pour. The word implies abundance (comp. Ezekiel 39:29; Joel 2:28). The house of David, etc. The leaders and the people alike, all orders and degrees in the theocracy. Jerusalem is named as the capital and representative of the nation. The spirit of grace and of supplications. The spirit which bestows grace and leads to prayer. \"Grace\" here means the effects produced in man by God's favour, that which makes the recipient pleasing to God and delighting in his commandments (Hebrews 10:29). They shall look upon me whom they have pierced. The Speaker is Jehovah. To \"look upon or unto\" implies trust, longing, and reverence (comp. Numbers 21:9; 2 Kings 3:14; Psalm 34:5; Isaiah 22:11). We may say generally that the clause intimates that the people, who had grieved and offended God by their sins and ingratitude, should repent and turn to him in faith. But there was a literal fulfilment of this piercing, i.e. slaying (Zechariah 13:3; Lamentations 4:9), when the Jews crucified the Messiah, him who was God and Man, and of whom, as a result of the hypostatic union, the properties of one nature are often predicated of the other. Thus St. Paul says that the Jews crucified \"the Lord of glory\" (1 Corinthians 2:8), and bids the Ephesian elders \"feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood\" (Acts 20:28; for the reading Θεοῦ, see the critics). St. John (John 19:37) refers to these words of Zechariah as a prophecy of the Crucifixion (camp. Revelation 1:7). The LXX. renders, Ἐπιβλέψονται πρὸς μὲ ἀνθ ῶν κατωχρήσαντο, \"They shall look to me because they insulted,\" either reading the last verb differently, or understanding it figuratively in the sense of assailing with cutting words; but there is no doubt about the true reading and interpretation. Vulgate, Aspicient ad me quem confixerunt. \"Me\" has been altered in some manuscripts into \"him:\" but this is an evident gloss received into the text for controversial purposes, or to obviate the supposed impropriety of representing Jehovah as slain by the impious. That St. John seems to sanction this reading is of no critical importance, as he is merely referring to the prophecy historically, and does not profess to give the very wording of the prophet. A suffering Messiah was not an unknown idea in Zechariah's time. He has already spoken of the Shepherd as despised and ill-treated, and a little further on (Zechariah 13:7) he intimates that he is stricken with the sword. The prophecies of Isaiah had familiarized him with the same notion (Isaiah 53, etc.). And when he represents Jehovah as saying, \"Me whom they pierced,\" it is not merely that in killing his messenger and representative they may be said to have killed him, but the prophet, by inspiration, acknowledges the two natures in the one Person of Messiah, even as Isaiah (Isaiah 9:6) called him the \"Mighty God,\" and the psalmists often speak to the same effect (Psalm 2:7; Psalm 45:6, 7; Psalm 110:1, etc.; comp. Micah 5:2). The \"looking to\" the stricken Messiah began when they who saw that woeful sight smote their breasts (Luke 23:48); it was carried on by the preaching of the apostles; it shall continue till all Israel is converted; it is re-enacted whenever penitent sinners turn to him whom they have crucified by their sins. Critics have supposed that the person whose murder is deplored is Isaiah, or Urijah, or Jeremiah; but none of these fulfill the prediction in the text. They shall mourn for him. There is a change of persons here. Jehovah speaks of the Messiah as distinct in Person from himself. As one mourneth for his only son... for his firstborn. The depth and poignancy of this mourning are expressed by a double comparison, the grief felt at the loss of an only son, and of the firstborn. Among the Hebrews the preservation of the family was deemed of vast importance, and its extinction regarded as a punishment and a curse, so that the death of an only son would be the heaviest blow that could happen (see Isaiah 47:9; Jeremiah 6:26; Amos 8:10). Peculiar privileges belonged to the firstborn, and his loss would be estimated accordingly (see Genesis 49:3; Exodus 4:22; Deuteronomy 21:17; Micah 6:7). The mention of \"piercing,\" just above, seems to connect the passage with the Passover solemnities and the destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians (see Expositor, vol. 6. p. 131, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - As if the above comparisons were not strong enough, the prophet presents a new one, referring to an historical event, which occasioned a universal mourning in Jerusalem. As the mourning of (at) Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. This is generally supposed to refer to the death of King Josiah of a wound received at Megiddo, in the battle with Pharaoh-Necho ( B.C. 60) ),and to the national lamentation made for him and long observed on the anniversary of the calamity (see 2 Kings 23:29; 2 Chronicles 35:20-25). This universal and perennial mourning is a figure of the continual remembrance of the death of Christ in the Church. There is a difficulty about the identification of Hadadrimmon. St. Jerome says it was a place in the Plain of Megiddo, near Jezreel, and known in his day by the name of Maximianopolis. This is supposed to be Rummaneh, seven miles northwest of Jezreel, on the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. But the identification is far from certain. The Assyrian name given to the place may, as Lowe suggests, be a confirmation of the post-exilian origin of the prophecy. The site of Megiddo also is undetermined, though Condor suggests Mujedda, a ruined city about three miles south of Bethshean. The opinion that the name Hadadrimmon is that of a Syrian or Phoenician god, whose rites were celebrated as those of Adonis (\"the weeping for Tammuz\" of Ezekiel 8:14), is preposterous; and the idea that the prophet would thus refer to the worship of an abominable idol is one that could have occurred only to disbelievers in revelation. The LXX., mistaking the text, gives, ὡς κοπετὸς ῤοῶνος ἐν πεδίῳ ἐκκοπτομένου, \"as mourning for a pomegranate cut off in the plain.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The land.

First the royal family is mentioned generally, to show that no one, however, high in station, is exempted from this mourning; and then a particular branch is named to individualize the lamentation. Nathan is that son of David from whom descended Zerubbabel (1 Chronicles 3:5; Luke 3:27, 31). Their wives apart. In private life the females of a household dwelt in apartments separate from the males, and in public functions the sexes were equally kept distinct (see Exodus 15:20; Judges 11:34; 1 Samuel 18:6; 2 Samuel 6:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Levi... Shimei. As before, the priestly family is first mentioned generally, and then individualized by naming Shimei, the son of Gershon, and grandson of Levi, of whom was the family of the Shimeites (Numbers 3:17, 18, 21). The LXX. gives, \"the tribe of Simeon,\" instead of \"the family of Shimei.\" But there is no reason for singling out this tribe. In one sense, this prophecy began to be fulfilled when a great company of priests were converted by the preaching of the apostles (Acts 6:7).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah12:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The families that remain.

This repentance will lead to purification from past defilement, and a reaction against idolatry and false prophet. Verse 1. - In that day. At the time when the great mourning (ch. 12.) takes place, or, more generally, in the Messianic period, when all these things shall be fulfilled. Shall be a fountain opened, etc. Shall be opened and continue open. The allusion is to the lustral rites practised in the consecration of the Levites, who were to have \"water of sin\" sprinkled on them, and to \"the water of separation,\" or \"water of uncleanness\" (the word found in our passage), used for purposes of legal purification (see Numbers 8:7; Numbers 19:9). Instead of this merely ceremonial cleansing, there should be in the Christian Church the cleansing of the soul by the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:2; 1 John 1:7). Septuagint, Ασται πᾶς τόπος διανοιγόμενος, \"Every place shall he opened.\" The house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem represent the whole nation, as in Zechariah 12:10; the cleansing is as universal as the sin (see the announcement in Ezekiel 36:25; Ezekiel 47:1-12; Joel 3:18). For sin and for uncleanness. The latter word is used for the separation on account of uncleanness (Leviticus 15:20, etc.); and the two terms together comprise all guilt and pollution.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - I will cut off the names of the idols. Idols should be so utterly abolished that their very names should perish (Hosea 2:17; Micah 5:12, 13; Zephaniah 1:4). The prophet names the two chief sins which had brought ruin on the old theocracy - idolatry and false prophetism, and declares that these shall not be found in the new theocracy. As these two sins were not specially prevalent after the Captivity, some see in their mention here an argument for the pre-exilian authorship of this part of Zechariah. But the prophet, grounding his message on past history, does well to give assurance that such lapses shall not happen again. Nor is it altogether certain that the warning against these errors was not needed after the return. There were false prophets in Nehemiah's time (Nehemiah 6:14); and we read in the Book of Maccabees that many Jews adopted heathen rites and customs, among which the worship of idols must have been included (1 Macc. 1:11, etc.; 2 Macc. 4:13, etc.), and the people and even priests contracted marriages with heathen wives (Ezra 9:2; Nehemiah 13:23); so that there was real danger of relapse. The prophets. The false prophets are meant, as is evident from their being associated with idols and the unclean spirit, and from vers. 3-6. The Septuagint has, \"the false prophets;\" so the Vulgate. The unclean spirit. This is the lying spirit which works in the false prophets (see 1 Kings 22:19-23), and which we find later denounced by apostles (Acts 16:18; 1 Corinthians 10:20, 21; 2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10; 1 Timothy 4:1). Septuagint, τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀκάθαρτον (comp, Matthew 12:43; Revelation 18:2).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - When any shall yet prophesy; i.e. if any man shall pretend to have predictive powers conferred on him by God. There is here no intimation that true prophecy should cease, as Keil and Kohler suppose; the man is punished, not because he prophesies, but because \"he speaketh lies.\" His father and his mother. The passage is grounded on the enactments in Deuteronomy 13:6-10 and Deuteronomy 18:20, which commanded the death of a false prophet or of one who enticed others to Idolatry. Here the holy zeal of the parents should put the law in force. This was quite a different state of things from that which obtained in former times. The earlier prophets continually complain of the favour shown to these deceivers (comp. Isaiah 9:15; Jeremiah 5:31; Micah 2:11); and we never read of the legal punishment being inflicted after due investigation, the test being the nonfulfilment of the prediction (Deuteronomy 18:22). In the new theocracy, so great is the recoil from such pretenders, that their nearest relations shall at once punish them with death without any previous legal process. Shall thrust him through. Stab, pierce him, put him to death, as in ch. 12:10. The gospel deals more tenderly with heretics (Luke 9:55). \"Defendenda religio non est occidendo,\" says Laetant. ('Div. Inst.,' 5:20), \"sed moriendo; religio cogi non potest \" (Wordsworth, in loc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Shall be ashamed. The falsity of their pretensions being now recognized, these prophets shall be ashamed to utter their oracles in public. When he hath prophesied; rather, when he prophesieth. A rough garment; a mantle of hair; Septuagint. δέῥῤιν τριχίνην: Vulgate, pallio saccino. Such was the mantle of Elijah (1 Kings 19:13, 19; 2 Kings 1:8; 2 Kings 2:13, 14) and of John the Baptist (Matthew 3:4), and it seems to have become the distinctive badge of the prophet, and was assumed by these pretenders in order to inspire confidence.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I am an husbandman. The imposter shall confess the truth about himself, and own that he is only \"a tiller of the ground (ἄνθρωπος ἐργαζόμενος τὴν γῆν),\" as Genesis 4:2. The abnegation in Amos 7:14 is quite different in character. Man taught me to keep cattle; literally, man bought (or, possessed) me; Revised Version, I have been made a bondman. So eager is he now to hide his false pretensions, that he is willing, to be considered a slave, employed from his youth in farm work, and therefore incapable of executing the prophetical office. Vulgate, Quoniam Adam exemplum meum ab adoloscentia mea; i.e. \"I have followed the example of Adam in tilling the ground and in earning my bread by the sweat of my brow.\" St. Cyril and some modern commentators hold that the false prophet says this in sorrow and repentant, not with any idea of deceiving; and that herein is exhibited a signal instance of the grace of God in the Messanic period, when even such sinners are converted from the error of their ways.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - What are these wounds in thine hands? or rather, between thy hands, i.e. on thy breast; Revised Version, between thine arms. Cheyne compares, \"between his arms,\" i.e., in his back (2 Kings 9:24) and \"between your eyes\" i.e. on your foreheads (Deuteronomy 11:18). Not satisfied with the assertion in ver. 5, the questioner asks the meaning of these wounds which he sees on his body. Jerome considers these scars to be marks of correction and punishment at the hands of his parents. More probably they are thought to be self-infilcted in the service of some idol, according to the practice mentioned in 1 Kings 18:28; Jeremiah 48:37. Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. This may be a confession of guilt, the impostor owning that his friends, had thus punished him for his pretensions; or, as the word rendered \"friends\" is generally used in the case of illicit or impure love or spiritual fornication, it may be here applied to the idols whom he served. But it seems most probable that the answer is intentionally false and misleading; as if he had said, \"The wounds were not made as you suppose, but are the result of something that happened to me in my friends' house.\" The LXX. renders, α}ς ἐπλήγην ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τῷ ἀγαπητῷ μου, \"with which I was struck in my beloved house.\" To see in this passage a reference to our blessed Lord and his crucifixion, though such an opinion has the support of the Roman Liturgy and of many interpreters, is to do violence to the context, and to read into the words a meaning wholly alien from the subject of false prophets, which is the matter in hand.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAwake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 7-9. - § 4. For the smiting of the good Shepherd Israel is punished, passes through much tribulation, by which it is refined, and in the end (though reduced to a mere remnant) is saved. Verse 7. - Awake, O sword. Zechariah proceeds to show the course of the purification of the people. The mention of the false prophet and the shameful wounds in his flesh leads him to the contrast of the true Prophet and the effects of his \"piercing.\" The abruptness of the commencement of the verse is dramatic, and gives no sufficient cause for supposing that this paragraph ought to be transferred (as Ewald and others desire) to the end of ch. 11. (For a similar apostrophe, comp. Jeremiah 47:6.) It is introduced here to show that all that happened to the Shepherd was done after the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God; and as if the sword could never have dared to act thus except it were permitted by the Divine will. The \"sword\" represents any kind of instrument that inflicts death (comp. Exodus 5:21; 2 Samuel 12:9; Isaiah 27:1). My Shepherd. The Shepherd of Jehovah, who is speaking. He is the good Shepherd, the Representative of Jehovah, mentioned in Zechariah 11:4, etc., the Messiah, who is identified with Jehovah in Zechariah 12:10. The Septuagint has, τοὺς ποιμένας μου, \"my shepherds\" (Vatican), as if no particular person was indicated, but rather all the leaders of the people of God; but the next clause seems to render the reference definite. The man that is my fellow. The word rendered \"man\" means rather \"mighty man;\" that rendered \"fellow\" occurs often in Leviticus, but nowhere else (Leviticus 5:21; 6:2; 19:11, 15, 17, etc.), and is usually translated \"neighbour;\" it implies one united to another by the possession of common nature, rights, and privileges. God could speak only of One thus associated with himself, that is, of him who could say, \"I and my Father are One\" (John 10:30). The term is variously translated by the versions. Septuagint, Ανδρα = πολίτην μου: Aquila, Ανδρα σύμφυλον μου: Vulgate, Virum cohaerentem mihi. That the Shepherd is Messiah is proved by Christ's application of the following clause to himself (Matthew 26:31). Smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. When Christ was apprehended, all the disciples forsook him and fled (Matthew 26:56); and what they did was done by others. Even the faithful few were scandalized at the cross The command, \"Smite the Shepherd,\" like the apostrophe, \"Awake, O sword,\" shows that it was God's purpose that was being there executed (see John 19:11; Acts 2:23). It is also thus intimated that the dispersion of the Jews, and their denationalizing, were results of this rejection and smiting of the Shepherd. This dispersion is farther explained in vers. 8, 9, where it is shown that to some it will be ruin, to others salvation. I will turn mine hand. \"To turn,\" or \"bring back the hand over,\" is used in a good and a bad sense (comp. Isaiah 1:25; Amos 1:8). There is a promise of comfort in the use of the phrase here. God's hand shall cover and protect some, while he punishes the others. Those thus protected are called the little ones, the humble and meek. This recalls Christ's words to his disciples, \"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom\" (Luke 12:32).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - In all the land; i.e. Palestine, the country in which the good Shepherd tended his flock (ch. 11.), and which is a figure of the kingdom of God (comp. Zechariah 12:12; Zechariah 14:9, 10). Two parts therein shall be cut off and die; literally, the mouth, i.e. the portion of two, as Deuteronomy 21:17; 2 Kings 2:9, where it denotes the double portion inherited by the firstborn. The inheritance is divided into three portions, of which two parts are given over to death. Compare a similar allotment in the case of the Moabites (2 Samuel 8:2). The doomed portion is supposed to represent the multitudes who perished at the siege of Jerusalem. This may be; but by analogy it stands for those who shall not accept the Messiah or be purified by suffering, even as Christ said, \"Many are called, but few chosen\" (Matthew 20:16; comp. Matthew 3:12). The third. This third part represents the faithful among the Jews (Romans 11:5), and the Christian Church gathered out of all nations (comp. Isaiah 6:13; and especially Ezekiel 5:2, 12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah13:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Through the fire. This third part, like its Master, passes through much tribulation, and is thereby refined and purified (comp. Psalm 66:10; Isaiah 48:10; Jeremiah 9:7; Daniel 12:10; Malachi 3:3; 1 Peter 1:6, 7). Call on my Name. In their distress they shall turn in faith to Jehovah, as the covenant God, a very present Help in trouble (Isaiah 65:24).

The Greek and Latin Versions have the plural, \"days of the Lord come.\" It is a time when he will specially manifest his glory and power, and be recognized as allowing the trial of his people for wise purposes. It is impossible to fix on any historical fulfilment of this prophecy. The details suit neither Maccabean nor Roman times; the attempt to define exactly the period and matter of its accomplishment has proved a failure, and has led to a mingling of events of very different dates, and to a conglomeration of senses literal, metaphorical, and anagogical, which creates confusion while assuming to explain difficulties. The literal interpretation must be resigned, and the whole prophecy must be taken to adumbrate the kingdom of God in its trial, development, and triumph. Thy spoil shall be divided. Jerusalem is addressed; and the prophet intimates that the enemy shall get possession of the capital, plunder it, and divide its spoil among themselves in its very midst with the greatest security, the inhabitants being wholly at the conquerors' mercy.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - How this shall come to pass is now shown. For I will gather all nations. God uses the Gentile nations as his instruments in this trial of his people; they are the fires by which he refines and purifies his elect (Joel 3:2, 9-11). The city shall be taken. The outrages offered to the captive city are such as are indicated in the case of Babylon (Isaiah 13:16; comp. Lamentations 5:11, etc.). Half of the city. The term \"half\" must not be pressed, as if it contradicted the mention of the two-thirds that were to perish, according to the prediction in Zechariah 13:8. It is a mere rhetorical expression. Or it may apply to the city alone, while the other referred to the whole land. Shall not be out off. In the former captivity all the people were carried away; in this capture of the city a remnant shall be left therein. It is plain from this statement that the prophecy cannot apply to the destruction of the city by the Romans; for, according to the account of Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:09), the city itself was razed to the ground, and all the inhabitants were either put to the sword or sold for slaves.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 3-7. - § 6.

There is nothing in the text to confine the reference to any one special interposition; it refers rather to the general course of God's providence in defending his people, though, doubtless, the prophet has in his mind the crowning act of mercy at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:13, 14, 25), which is so often referred to as a typical deliverance (comp. Isaiah 11:11; Jeremiah 16:14; Jeremiah 23:8; Habakkuk 3:15; and above, Zechariah 10:11).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - His feet shall stand. By this theophany he shall come to the aid of his people; nature shall do his bidding, owning the presence of its Maker. Upon the Mount of Olives... on the east. This mount lay on the east of Jerusalem, from which it was separated by the deep valley of the Kidron, rising to a height of some six hundred feet, and intercepting the view of the wilderness of Judaea and the Jordan ghor. The geographical detail is added in the text to indicate the line of escape which shall be opened for those who are to be de-livened. This is the only place in the Old Testament where the Mount of Olives is thus exactly named; but it is often alluded to; e.g. 2 Samuel 15:30; 1 Kings 11:7; 2 Kings 23:13 (where it is called \"the mount of corruption\"), etc. Shall cleave in the midst thereof. As the enemy are supposed to beset Jerusalem, so as to make escape by any ordinary road impossible, the Lord will open a way through the very centre of the mountain (as he opened a path through the Red Sea), by cleaving the hill in sunder, the two parts moving north and south, and leaving a great valley running east and west, and leading to the Arabah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains; i.e. by the ravine made by the cleaving of Olivet into two, which God calls \"my mountain,\" because effected by his special interposition. Septuagint, Φραχθήσεται ἡ φάραγξ τῶν ὀρέων μου, \"The valley of my mountains shall be blocked;\" Vulgate, Fugietis ad vallem montium eorum. The last word is probably an error for meorum. Into the chasm thus miraculously formed the remnant shall flee for refuge. Unto Azal; ἕως Ἰασόδ (Septuagint); usque ad proximum (Vulgate); so Symmachus. If Azal, or Azel, be a proper name, it is with some probability identified with Beth-ezel, mentioned in Micah 1:11, a village on the east of Olivet. The meaning in this case is that the valley should extend from the west unto the east side of the Mount of Olives, and that in it the people shall find an asylum, that they might not be involved in the judgments which fall on the enemy. Some take Azal to mean \"union,\" and see in it a symbol of the union of the Law and the gospel, or the Jew and Gentile, in one Church - the valley of God's mountain extending to \"union;\" that is, to enfolding all the faithful (see Wordsworth, in loc.). The earthquake in the days of Uzziah. This is mentioned in Amos 1:1, but not in the historical books (see note on Amos, loc. cit.). The intervention of the Lord is here accompanied by an earthquake, which produces the same panic as on the former occasion, and drives the inhabitants to flight. Shall come. To smite his enemies and to defend his people. All the saints (holy ones) with thee. The versions have, \"with him;\" and thus many Hebrew manuscripts. But such abrupt changes of persons are not uncommon (see note on Zechariah 2:8). The \"holy ones\" are the angels (comp. Deuteronomy 33:2; Job 5:1; Daniel 7:10; and the parallel predictions in Matthew 24:30, 31; Matthew 25:31).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The light shall not be clear, nor dark.

It is plain that a time of distress and calamity is intended, and that the passage is threatening and not consolatory, at any rate, at first. There is solid ground for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, adopted by Cheyne and others, which is according to the Khetib, \"There shall not be light, the bright ones shall contract themselves;\" i.e. the heavenly bodies shall contract their light, or be heaped confusedly together, and cease to shine. The prediction in this case may be compared with that in Joel 3:15; Isaiah 13:10; and in Matthew 24:29; Revelation 6:12, 13. The Authorized Version is explained in the margin, i.e. \"It shall not be clear in some places, and dark in other places of the world\" - a gloss which is inadmissible.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - One day.

It cannot be called truly the one or the other, because there is darkness in the day and light at night, as the following clause says. This is symbolically explained by St. Ephraem, \"It will not be altogether consolation, nor altogether affliction.\" It is not full daylight, for calamity presses; it is not deep night, because there is hope amid the distress. At evening time it shall be light. In the midst of trouble and danger deliverance shall come. The whole section is a figurative description of the fortunes of the Church militant, even as Christ announced to his disciples: \"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world\" (John 16:33); \"If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you\" (John 15:20); \"Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid' (John 14:27).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 8-11. - § 7. Then shall occur a season of joy. The land shall be transformed and renewed, and the Lord shall be owned as the sole King of all the earth. Verse 8. - Living waters; i.e. water fresh, pure, and perennial (Genesis 26:19; Jeremiah 2:13), a figure of the spiritual blessings and graces bestowed by God upon his Church. From Jerusalem, as the centre and representative of the kingdom of God, as in Zechariah 12:2. The city itself was, as we know, abundantly supplied with water by many conduits and subterranean channels; but standing, as it does, surrounded by hills higher than itself, it is physically impossible that the waters could literally flow as stated. The description is symbolical, though the natural features of the country are supposed to be changed in order to preserve verisimilitude (comp. Ezekiel 47:1, etc.; Joel 3:18). The former (eastern) sea... the hinder (western) sea. The Dead Sea is the eastern sea to one looking to sunrise from Jerusalem: the Mediterranean is the western sea, behind the observer's back. Into every quarter the salutary stream shall flow. In summer and in winter. Neither drought nor frost shall stop their perennial flow. \"Alike in times of peace and of persecution those waters shall continue their course\" (St. Jerome); Septuagint, \"In summer and in spring\" - a rendering which seems to indicate the home of the Alexandrian Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - All the earth; all the land of Israel (vers. 8, 10) - a type of the kingdom of God in all its extent (Revelation 11:15, \"The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever\"). Shall there be one Lord; rather, Jehovah shall be one. He shall be universally acknowledged as \"the blessed and only Potentate\" (1 Timothy 6:15). His name one. Idolatry shall be abolished, and the one God shall be everywhere adored (comp. Zechariah 13:2; Deuteronomy 6:4). Men shall no longer attribute operations and effects to various heavenly powers, but shall see and confess that all are derived from and centre in him, and are only different revelations of his ineffable nature and attributes. We do not, indeed, see this prediction yet fulfilled, but the grace to accomplish it is ready and operating; it is only men's perverse wills that impede the gracious purpose of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAll the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - All the land shall be turned as a plain. To indicate the exaltation and stability of the centre of the new theocracy, the prophet announces that all the country round Jerusalem shall be turned into a plain, dominated by the metropolis, which stands sublime on a lofty mountain. The Revised Version renders, \"shall be turned as the Arabah,\" i.e. as the Jordan ghor, a valley of abnormal fertility. From Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; i.e. from the north of Judah to its southern boundary. Geba was a town and district on the edge of the great Wady Suweinit, five miles north of Jerusalem. It is identified with Jeba (1 Samuel 13:3), and it formed the northern boundary of the kingdom of Judah (Joshua 18:24). Rimmon is described as \"south of Jerusalem,\" to distinguish it from a town of the same name in Galilee (Joshua 19:13), and from the famous rock Rimmon, to which the Benjamites fled (Judges 20:45, 47). It was situated in the territory of Simeon (Joshua 15:32; Joshua 19:7), and has been identified with Umm-er-Rummamin, a town ten miles north of Beersheba. It shall be lifted up. Jerusalem shall remain exalted on its hill, while all the country around sinks into a plain - a figure representing the spiritual exaltation of the new theocracy. Inhabited in her place; or, shall dwell in her place. Shall occupy her ancient limits, and abide there safely without fear (comp. Jeremiah 31:38-40; Ezekiel 48:15, etc.). From Benjamin's gate, etc. (Jeremiah 37:13). It is difficult to define the given boundaries with certainty in every particular. Benjamin's gate is the same as the gate of Ephraim (2 Kings 14:13; Nehemiah 8:16), so called as leading to the territory of Benjamin, and beyond again to that of Ephraim. It was situated in the north or second wall. From this point the course of the wall is followed, first to the west, and then to the east. The first gate. This was in the eastern part at this wall, and is the same as \"the old gate,\" or \"gate of the old town,\" of Nehemiah 12:39. The corner gate (2 Kings 14:13; Jeremiah 31:38) was at the northwest corner, west of the gate of Benjamin, at the angle where the first and second walls approached each other. These dimensions would give the breadth of the city from east to west. The tower of Hananeel (Nehemiah 3:l) was at the northeast corner of the north wall, where the citadel Basis or Antonia afterwards stood. The king's wine presses were probably near \"the king's garden\" (Nehemiah 3:15), at the southeast extremity of the city. They may have been cut out of the rock, as was often the case. This description gives the extent of the city from north to south. Thus Zechariah illustrates the growth and stability of the Church of God by the figure of the earthly city Jerusalem, firmly and orderly built, and inhabited by a teeming population, as the following verse shows. There is no ground for expecting the literal fulfilment of this prediction.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Men shall dwell in it. There shall be no tear of exile and captivity, and no necessity to fly from a victorious enemy (vers. 2, 5). Utter destruction; literally, curse, ban; LXX. and Vulgate, \"There shall be no more anathema.\" The inhabitants shall not incur the curse which is inflicted on transgressors, idolaters, and their cities by the old Law (see Exodus 22:20; Deuteronomy 7:2; Deuteronomy 13:12-15; Deuteronomy 20:17; comp. Ezra 10:8; Isaiah 43:28; Revelation 22:3). Shall be safely inhabited; or, shall dwell safely. Sin being removed, there will be no more occasion for chastisement; and the spiritual Jerusalem shall never be destroyed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 12-15. - § 8. Having noted the blessings on the true Israelites, the prophet gives further details concerning the destruction of the enemies: they shall perish by plague, by mutual slaughter, by the sword of Judah. Verse 12. - This shall be the plague. These are the instruments which the Lord uses when he fights against the nations (not the people, as in the Authorized Version), ver. 3. The plague, or smiting (maggephah), is some contagions affliction sent by God, as in Exodus 9:14; Numbers 14:37; 1 Samuel 6:4. Their. It is, in the Hebrew, \"his flesh, his feet,\" etc., to show that the general plague extends to every individual. In the last clause the plural is used, \"their mouth.\" With body, eye, and tongue they opposed the holy city, and took pleasure in its discomfiture: in all their members they shall suffer retributive punishment. While they stand upon their feet. The flesh of each shall putrefy and moulder away, while he is still alive and arrayed against the city of God. Holes; soakers. The eyes had spied out the weak places in the defence, and looked with malicious pleasure on the defeat and fall. Tongue. They had blasphemed God, and cried against his holy place, \"Down with it, even to the ground!\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - A great tumult from the Lord (Zechariah 12:4). A general panic or confusion sent by the Lord, such as befell the Midianites (Judges 7:22) and the Philistines (l 1 Samuel 14:20), which ends in mutual slaughter. They shall lay hold every one, etc. In this general panic each shall seize his neighbour's hand in fierce contention. The next clause gives the same meaning (comp. Zechariah 11:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem. The adversus Jerusalem of the Vulgate and some Jewish interpreters is a mistake, and introduces a wholly irrelevant idea. The meaning is that the Judaeans outside of Jerusalem, the nation at large, rallying to the attack, shall fall on the enemy, now thinned by pestilence and internecine conflicts within the walls of the city, and prevail against them (comp. Zechariah 12:6). Septuagint, Ἰούδας παρατάξεται ἐν Ἱερουσαλήμ,\" Judah shall draw up his forces in Jerusalem.\" The wealth of all the heathen (nations) round about. The costly booty of the enemy shall fall into Judah's hands. Thus the Church emerges victorious from persecutions, and is enriched and adorned by the means of those who planned her overthrow.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So shall be the plague of the horse, etc. As was the plague that came on men (ver. 12), so shall be tide plague that falls on their beasts and cattle. The brute animals suffer for their owners' sin according to the ban under the old Law (Deuteronomy 13:15; comp. Numbers 16:32, 33; Joshua 7:24, 25). Tents; camps; Septuagint, παρεμβολαῖς. The verse illustrates the utter destruction which shall befall the enemies of God's Church.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 16-19. - § 9. Warned by these manifestations of God's power, the residue of the heathen shall be converted, and shall join with the Hebrews in the regular worship of Jehovah. Verse 16. - Every one that is left. All the heathen that attacked the holy city shall not be destroyed; the remnant saved small become subjects of the Divine kingdom. Shall go up. This is the usual phrase for going to Jerusalem for the purpose of worship (comp. Isaiah 2:2, 3; Micah 4:2; Luke 2:42; John 7:8). The prophet here and in the following clause speaks as a Jew to Jews, who knew and observed only the prescribed form of worship. It is evident that the announcement could never be literally fulfilled; the Gentile world could never come yearly to pay their devotions at Jerusalem. The prediction can only signify that under Messiah's reign the Gentiles shall be converted to true religion and worship God in regular, orderly fashion, the prophet intimating this in terms derived from the old dispensation, which had the Divine sanction. The Feast of Tabernacles. The Israelites were required to appear before the Lord three times in the year (Exodus 23:17; Deuteronomy 16:16) - at the festivals of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. But the Gentiles are here required to present themselves only once. The Feast of Tabernacles is chosen for this occasion owing to its peculiar character and the associations connected with it. It commemorated not only the ingathering of the harvest, but also Israel's sojourn in the wilderness and tide Divine protection there accorded to them, and their entrance into tide promised land; it was therefore a fitting symbol of the rescue of the Gentiles from the devil's kingdom, and their entry into the Church of God, where they enjoyed the blessings of God's grace and protection. It was also a more catholic feast, in one sense, titan the Passover or Pentecost, not being so distinctively Jewish, but one which all nations could keep in gratitude to the Giver of material benefits. We must remember, also, that it was at this feast that our Lord cried (John 7:37), \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink,\" and likewise he declared himself to be \"the Light of the world\" (John 8:12), wishing us, it may be, to understand that this feast was the one we should need to keep, being the one which specially sets him forth as the Sustainer and Guide through life's pilgrimage.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Will not come up; goeth not up. Those who neglected this yearly worship shall be punished according to the threat in Deuteronomy 11:16, 17. No rain. The failure of periodic rain in Eastern countries meant drought, famine, and widespread distress. In a spiritual sense, rain represents the grace and blessing of God; these are withholden from those who refuse to worship him and wilfully cut themselves off from the Church. The LXX. has, Καὶ οῦτοι ἐκείνοις προστεθήσονται, \"These shall be associated with those,\" i.e. shall be reckoned among those enemies whose punishment has been mentioned above.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 18. - If the family of Egypt go not up. Egypt is mentioned as the great typical enemy of God and Israel, and therefore most obnoxious to punishment if it did not obey the call. That have no rain. This rendering implies, what is not the fact, that Egypt is without rain, and is not dependent upon rain for its fertility. The expression in the text is elliptical, being merely, \"then not on them,\" and it is obviously natural to supply, \"shall there be rain.\" As the rise of the Nile depends upon the equinoctial rains in the interior, the failure of these would be disastrous. Another way of rendering the passage is to combine the clauses and append a note of interrogation; thus: \"Shall there not be upon them the plague wherewith,\" etc.? The LXX. and Syriac omit the negative, Καὶ ἐπὶ τούτους ἔσται ἡ πτῶσις, \"Even upon these shall be the plague.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThis shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The punishment; literally, sin; ἁμαρτία: peccatum; here obviously the punishment of sin - sin with all its fatal consequences (comp. Numbers 18:22; Lamentations 3:39; Lamentations 4:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD'S house shall be like the bowls before the altar.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 20, 21. - § 10. Then everything alike shall be holy, and the ungodly shall be altogether excluded from the house of the Lord. Verse 20. - Upon the bells of the horses. The prophet, describing the holiness of the theocracy, uses imagery drawn from the ritual customs of the Law. \"The bells,\" says Henderson, \"were small metallic plates, suspended from the necks or heads of horses and camels, for the sake of ornament, and making a tinkling noise by striking against each other like cymbals.\" Probably these plates had the names of the owners engraven on them. The Septuagint gives \"bridle,\" which possibly the unusual word metzilloth may mean. HOLINESS (holy) UNTO THE LORD; Sanctum Domino (Vulgate); Ἅγιον τῷ Κυρίῳ παντοκράτορι (Septuagint). This was the inscription upon the golden plate on the mitre of the high priest (Exodus 28:36). The affixing of this inscription on the trappings of horses signifies that the commonest things shall become holy, all things that men use for work, profit, or ornament shall be consecrated to God's service. The pots in the Lord's house. The \"pots\" are vessels of inferior sanctity used for boiling the meat of the sacrifice (1 Samuel 2:14; 2 Chronicles 35:13). The bowls before the altar. These held the blood of the victims for sprinkling on the altar, and the sacred libations, and were considered of superior sanctity. The prophet announces that now all shall be holy, the lower equal to the highest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah14:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The last announcement is amplified. Every pot. All the vessels of the country shall be consecrated and used in Divine service. The Levitical distinction shall be abolished, and the Lord's service shall be perfect freedom. Every member of the Church, however humble his station or mean his acquirements, shall be a saint and fit for the Lord's use (comp. 2 Timothy 2:21). The Canaanite; mercator (Vulgate). The word is used in the sense of \"trafficker,\" or \"merchant,\" in Job 40:30 (Job 41:6, Authorized Version); Proverbs 31:24 (comp. Zephaniah 1:11). If any vessel might now be used in God's service, worshippers would no longer be obliged to buy special bowls from those who sold in the temple courts (Matthew 21:12). But it is best in agreement with the context to take \"Canaanite\" to mean any unclean or profane person (comp. Genesis 9:25; Leviticus 18:28, etc.). Thus Daniel, in the History of Susanna, ver. 56, addresses the wicked elder, \"Thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Jude;\" and Isaiah (Isaiah 1:10) calls the chiefs of Israel \"rulers of Sodom,\" and \"people of Gomorrah.\" Henceforward the \"people shall be all righteous\" (Isaiah 60:21). There shall be one, holy, Catholic Church. Thus the vision of the golden candlestick (ch. 4.) is fulfilled; and that this should come to pass is the design of God's manifold providences and operations (comp. Revelation 21:27; Revelation 22:15).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.1":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1. - § 1.

Haggai had first prophesied two months earlier. The second year of Darius. Being now under foreign rule, the prophet uses the regnal years of the king to whom his people were subject (see note on Haggai 1:1). Son of Berechiah (see Introduction, § II.). The prophet. This appellation belongs to \"Zechariah,\" as the LXX. and Vulgate take it. A comma should be inserted after \"Iddo\" here and in ver. 7. Saying.

Verse 2. - Hath been sore displeased; literally, displeased with displeasure, which the versions render, ὠργίσθη ὀργὴν μεγάλην: iratus iracundia (el. ver. 15). Not only events connected with their earlier history proved that God had been incensed with their forefathers, but the ruin of their kingdom, and the late Captivity, and the desolation around them, were evidence of the same sad truth.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Say thou unto them. The prophet shows why he has reminded them of their forefathers' sins and punishment. Saith the Lord of hosts. The expression recurs three times in this verse; it denotes the almightiness and infinite resources of God (see note A in the appendix to Archdeacon Perowne's edition of this prophet). Its constant repetition, as in Haggai, gives a certain heaviness to the prophet's style. Turn (return) ye unto me. He calls the people to repentance, partly, doubtless, with a view to their taking an active part in rebuilding the temple, thus carrying on the exhortations of Haggai, but also with reference to their general indevotion and laxity which Ezra afterwards had to reprove (see Ezra 9:2). Saith the Lord of hosts; literally, (it is) the utterance of Jehovah of hosts. This is a more threatening form than the mere \"saith\" in the other two places in this verse. And I will turn (return) unto you (Malachi 3:7). God promises his favour on their repentance and better conduct; as Haggai had been commissioned to proclaim a return of fruitful seasons as soon as the people obeyed his word and attended diligently to the work before them (Haggai 2:19). They were called now to attend to the pure worship of the Lord, as the sole condition of prosperity (comp. 2 Chronicles 30:6; James 4:8). It has been well observed that when it is said, \"Turn ye unto me,\" etc., we are reminded of our free will; and when we cry, \"Turn us, good Lord, and we shall be turned,\" we acknowledge the need of God's preventing grace.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBe ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - The former prophets have cried. Omit \"have.\" The prophets referred to are those before the Captivity, both those whoso writings are extant, as Hosea, Joel, Amos, etc., and those whose names are mentioned in the historical books, e.g. Nathan, Gad, Shemaiah, Azariah, Hanaui, Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah (Pusey).

They can teach and threaten no longer. It is true that the seers who warned your fathers are no more, but did not their words come true (see ver. 6)?

The LXX. inserts \"receive ye\" to govern these nouns. I commanded. The LXX. adds, ἐν πνεύματὶ μου, \"by my inspiration.\" Did they not take hold of your fathers? Did they not overtake, etc.? Did not their threatened chastisements, however long delayed, reach your fathers in the end? And they returned; turned, as vers. 3, 4.

The four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat. This month (called here by its Chaldean name) answered to parts of January and February. It was three months since Zechariah had been called to the prophetical office, and five since the building of the temple had been resumed at Haggai's remonstrance. Meantime Haggai had concluded his mission by uttering his final prophecies two months ago, and now Zechariah carries on the revelation. A comparison of the months in the cuneiform inscriptions with the Hebrew will be found in Schrader, 'Keilinschriften,' 379, and in Dr. Wright's note on this verse. The word of the Lord.

The visions were seen in this one night at short intervals. There is nothing to make one suppose that they came in dreams (Isaiah 29:7). The prophet is awake, but whether he sees these scenes with his bodily eyes, or was rapt in ecstasy, cannot be decided. A man riding upon a red horse. This is the Angel of Jehovah, mentioned again in ver. 10 and in ver. 11, in both of which places the description, \"that stood among the myrtle trees,\" serves to identify him. He is different from the interpreting angel, and is the leader of the company of horsemen that follow him. Keil and Wright consider that the rider on the red horse cannot be identified with the Angel of Jehovah, because otherwise he would have been represented as standing opposite to the other horsemen to receive the information which they brought him, and they would not have been spoken of as \"behind\" hint. But the expression in ver. 8 may mean merely that the prophet sets his eyes first on the leader and then on the attendants. Or in ver. 10 he is the spokesman who begins the account of the riders' doings, which these themselves complete in ver. 11. Thus there are in the scene onlyNEWLINENEWLINE(1) the prophet;NEWLINENEWLINE(2) the angel rider and his attendants; andNEWLINENEWLINE(3) the interpreting angel.NEWLINENEWLINEThe red colour of the horse is supposed to represent war and bloodshed, as in Revelation 6:4; but this seems unsuitable in this piece, where nothing of the kind is intimated, but rather the contrary (ver. 11). It is, indeed, impossible to affix any satisfactory explanation to the colour. If, as we may well suppose, this personage is the Angel of the covenant, who was the leader and guide of the Israelites (comp. Joshua 5:13), his standing in the valley among the myrtles may represent the depressed and humbled condition of the chosen people, which yet was well pleasing unto God, like the sweet scent of odoriferous myrtles is agreeable to men. The myrtle trees. The myrtle is indigenous in the hilly regions of Northern Palestine, and is still seen in the glens near Jerusalem, though no longer on the Mount of Olives, where the returned captives found it when celebrating their first Feast of Tabernacles (Nehemiah 8:15). In the bottom; the valley. Myrtles love such places. \"Amantes littora myrtos\" (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:124). The term would suit the valley of the Kidron. Others render, \"the shady place,\" or \"the tabernacle,\" but not so appropriately. LXX., ἀναμέσον τῶν [Alex., 860] ὀρέων τῶν κατασκίων, \"between the shady mountains.\" The Greek translators seem to have borrowed their reading from ch. 6, where the chariots issue from between two mountains of brass. Behind him were them red horses; i.e. horses mounted by riders (ver. 11). Speckled. It is not clear what colour is meant by this word. The Revised Version gives sorrel; Wright, \"bay or chestnut;\" LXX., ψαροί καὶ ποιλίλοι: \"dapple-grey and spotted;\" Vulgate, varii. The Septuagint Version is probably a double rendering. The word occurs elsewhere only in Isaiah 16:8, where it is applied to the tendrils of the vitae. What is intended by the different colours of the horses is a matter of great dispute, and cannot be known. There is some reason for considering that they represent the world powers at this particular period - the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greek; three of those concerning which Daniel prophesied; the fourth, the Roman, not having yet come in view. The notion of tutelary angels, presiding over countries, was familiar to the Hebrew mind (see Daniel 10:12, 13, 20, 21). These horsemen are evidently not post couriers, but warriors on military service.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - O my lord. The prophet speaks to the angel of the Lord, who answers briefly, and is succeeded by the interpreting angel. What are these? Not \"who,\" but \"what;\" i.e. what do they signify? (comp. Amos 7:8). That talked with me; literally, as the LXX. and Vulgate, that spake in me. So vers. 13, 14, and in the following visions. Hence some regard the expression as intimating a communication berne inwardly to the soul without the aid of external organs, or that the angel overpowered and influenced the prophet as the evil spirit possessed the demoniac. But the same term is used, as Dr. Wright points out, in the sense of to commune with a person (Numbers 12:6, 8; 1 Samuel 25:39), and to speak to a person (Hosea 1:2; and perhaps Habakkuk 2:1). It may, however, be that the angel of the Lord presented matters objectively, and the prophet's own angel interpreted subjectively. But the Authorized Version is probably correct. I will show thee. This he does through the chief angel (ver. 10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The man that stood, etc. The rider upon the red horse of ver. 8, the leader of the company of horsemen. Answered the question which the prophet had proposed, or answered in response to a sign from the interpreting angel. They whom the Lord hath sent, etc. These angelic ministers had been sent to traverse the earth and to report its condition (comp. Job 1:7; Job 2:2; Hebrews 1:14), and to guide it to the carrying out of God's purposes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - They answered. Having said who they were, the angel directs them to tell of their doings. The angel of the Lord. The \"man riding upon the red horse\" (ver. 8) is now called \"the Angel of Jehovah.\" This term is usually held to denote a manifestation of the Logos, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, assuming an angelic form or imparting his immediate presence to the revealer of his will. Sitteth still, and is at rest. The world was lying in proud security. There was no sign of that shaking of nations which Haggai (Haggai 2:7, 21, 22) had foretold should precede the coming of Messiah and the restoration of Israel. In this second year of Darius, the empire, though suffering from internal disturbances, was outwardly at peace, and was threatened by no enemy at a distance. But the condition of the Jews was sad and disheartening; the temple still unbuilt, the walls of Jerusalem lying in ruins, themselves only a small remnant, exposed to the insults and attacks of jealous neighbours, living on sufferance as subjects of a heathen power, and no sign of the predicted salvation appearing, - this was their state. And the angel sees their despondency, recognizes their disappointment, and intercedes for them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Answered. He answered the feeling in the prophet's mind, the unexpressed longing of his heart. O Lord of hosts. The angel is the intercessor for the people. So Christ prays to the Father (John 17.). How long wilt thou not have mercy, etc.? He prays that the weary waiting for deliverance may speedily come to an end, and Jerusalem be restored, and Judaea be again inhabited by a happy population. These three score and ten years. The predicted seventy years of captivity (Jeremiah 25:11; Jeremiah 29:10) were past; it was time that the punishment should cease. There are two computations of this period. The first dates from the first capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, B.C. 606, when Judaea was made tributary to Babylon (2 Kings 24:1: 2 Chronicles 36:6; Daniel 1:1, etc.), unto the return of the company of exiles under Zerubbabel, B.C. 536; the second dates from the final destruction of Jerusalem, B.C. 588, unto the second year of Darius, B.C. 519, when Zechariah saw these visions. However reckoned, the dark period was now over; might they not now expect the commotion among the nations which was to precede their own restitution?NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord answered. The Angel of Jehovah is thus ca]led as the representative of God, whether we regard him as the Logos or a created angel empowered by God (see note on ver. 11). This personage is often seemingly identified with Jehovah (comp. Zechariah 3:2; Genesis 18:1, 2, 13, 17, 22; Joshua 5:14, 15; Joshua 6:2). He gives the answer to the interpreting angel, which the latter is to convey to the prophet, which he, in turn, was to announce to the people. Good words, promising blessing and salvation (1 Kings 12:7); and these are comfortable words (Isaiah 57:18), a message calculated to bring comfort to the people's desponding hearts. What the message is is given in the following verses (14-17).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - Cry thou (Isaiah 40:6). The prophet has to publish two things:NEWLINENEWLINE(1) God's love for his people, however humiliated and miserable their present position might be; andNEWLINENEWLINE(2) the promise of coming prosperity. I am jealous. The term implies ardent love, which cannot bear itself to be slighted, or the object of its affection to be injured (comp. Zechariah 8:2, and note there; Numbers 25:11, 13; Joel 2:18). For Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom; and for Zion, as the seat of worship.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - The heathen; the nations, who were God's instruments in punishing Israel. That are at ease. Living in proud security and self-enjoyment (Isaiah 32:9, 11; Amos 6:1; comp. ver. 11). Septuagint, τὰ συνεπιτιθέμενα, \"which join in attacking her;\" Vulgate, opulentas, \"wealthy,\" their riches giving them self-confidence. I was but a little displeased. God had been angry with his people, it is true, but only in measure, chastising them, like a parent, for their good. Others take \"a little\" (parum, ὀλίγα) to mean \"for a little time,\" in allusion to the seventy years' captivity. And they helped forward the affliction; or, in the LXX., συνεπέθεντο εἰς κακὰ, \"helped for evil; \"Vulgate, adjuverunt in malum. They exceeded their part as mere instruments in God's hands, and wished to destroy Israel altogether, or to oppress them beyond the purposed period of their chastisement. A similar complaint is made against the Assyrians (Isaiah 10:5, etc.) and the Babylonians (Isaiah 47:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Therefore. Because God loved his people and was incensed with the heathen. I am returned; I return. According to the promise in ver. 3 (see note on Zechariah 8:3). A line shall be stretched forth. A measuring line shall now be used to mark out the city for rebuilding (Job 38:5). The first proof of God's renewed mercy would be seen in the restoration of the temple, the symbol of the theocracy, and in the revival of the city, the type of national life. The \"line\" had been used for purposes of destruction (2 Kings 21:13; Isaiah 34:11; Lamentations 2:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTCry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Cry yet, saying. This introduces the second part of the prophet's message. The LXX. begins the verse with the words, \"And the angel that spake in me said unto me.\" My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad. \"Yet,\" in this verse, is better rendered again. God calls the cities his, to show his love for Judah; and he promises that they shall not only be reoccupied by returning immigrants, but increased in extent and number by reason of the enlarged population. So Josephus tells us that in later times Jerusalem had outgrown its walls, and that the fourth quarter, Bezetha, was added ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:04. 2). But it seems' best to translate the clause thus: \"My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity.\" Vulgate, Adhuc affluent civitates meae bonis; LXX., Ατι διαχυθήσονται πόλεις ἐν ἀγαθοῖς. Shall yet comfort Zion, for all her afflictions. Shall yet choose Jerusalem (Zechariah 2:12 [16, Hebrew]; 3:2). God will show that the election of Israel remains unimpaired and secure (comp. 2 Kings 21:7; 2 Chronicles 6:5). The partial fulfilment of the items of this prophecy are to be found in the rebuilding of the temple, the restoration of Jerusalem by Nehemiah, and the prosperity of Judah under the Asmonean princes. A hint of further blessings is given in the final clause, but their nature is not expressly mentioned.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-21. - § 4. The second vision. the four horns and the four craftsmen. Verse 18. - I lifted up mine eyes, and saw. This vision is closely connected with the former. The prophet had been told that the hostile nations should be punished and scattered; he now is shown this threat being executed. Four horns, belching to four beasts but dimly seen or wholly invisible. Horns are symbols of strength and power (comp. Psalm 75:4, 5; Daniel 8:3; Amos 6:13). Here they mean powers hostile to Israel, and the number \"four\" (the symbol of completeness) points to the four winds from which they come, i.e. from every side. In the Hebrew ch. 2. begins at this verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - Which have scattered, etc. Some see here an allusion to the prophecy of Daniel concerning the Babylonians, Medo-Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. Against this view it is urged that the prophet is speaking of past events, not of a far distant future. Others Lake the four horns to represent Assyria, Egypt, Babylon, and Medo-Persia, all of which had scattered Israel. But it is well to lay no special stress on such explanations of symbolical language, which are at best mere conjectures, liable to be overthrown by a new theory. The word \"scattered,\" which Jerome renders ventilaverunt, means properly, as Wright observes, \"to winnow,\" to separate and scatter by means of the wind. The perfect tense of this verb must not be pressed so as to exclude all notion of coming events. The prophets see at one glance past and future, and combine in one expression far distant occurrences. Doubtless Zechariah's vision has some relation to Daniel's, and his description of the powers hostile to the Church of God runs on parallel lines with that of his predecessor. Whether be refers to the same four empires must be left in uncertainty. Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. All the tribes and the capital. According to Ewald, Judah is named first as occupying the place of honour, even as Benjamin is named before Judah in Psalm 68:27, because the capital city lay in its territory. Jerusalem was the centre of worship and government for all the people, the northern tribes being represented by Israel. the southern by Judah. Some critics cancel the word \"Israel\" here, and there is no doubt that it is often written for \"Jerusalem\" by mistake (comp. Jeremiah 23:6 [where see Professor Cheyne's note]; 32:30, 32; 51:49; Zephaniah 3:14; Malachi 2:11). Gratz supposes that in the present passage the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word \"Jerusalem\" after the wrong one \"Israel,\" but leaving the latter still in the manuscript. Of course, there is no proof of this supposition. Some manuscripts of the Septuagint omit \"Jerusalem\" here.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shewed me four carpenters.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - Four carpenters; craftsmen; Revised Version, smiths, in which case \"the horns\" would be made of iron. The word is applied to workers in wood, stone, and metal; therefore an ambiguous rendering seems most suitable here. LXX., τέκτονας; Vulgate, fabros. They represent the human agencies employed by God to overthrow the powers hostile to the Church. Their number is the same as that of the \"horns,\" thus showing their adequacy for the work which they have to execute. It is quite unnecessary to attempt to identify the four \"craftsmen.\" Some take them to be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah; or Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Cambyses, and Alexander the Great; or the four evangelists; or generally, angels. We shall be safer if we look upon them merely as God's instruments and servants without further identification.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah1:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - And he spake. The interpreting angel spake. Which have scattered Judah. The LXX. adds, \"and broke Israel in pieces.\" Did lift up his head. These powers laid Judah prostrate. To fray them. To terrify the powers symbolized by the four horns, and disturb their self-complacent Security (ver. 15). The LXX., mistaking the sense, gives, Τοῦ ὀξῦναι αὐτὰ εἰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν τὰ τέσσαρα κέρατα, \"To sharpen them, even the four horns, in their hands.\" To cast out; to cast down, to overthrow these proud powers. Over (against) the land. The nations had treated Judah as a wild bull treats things that oppose him, tossing and scattering them to the wind.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.2":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-13. - § 5. The third vision: the man with the measuring line. Verse 1. - (Hebrews 2:5.) I lifted up mine eyes again (comp. Zechariah 5:1; Zechariah 6:1; Daniel 8:3). This third vision makes a further revelation of God's mercy to Israel. Consequent on the destruction of enemies shall be the growth and development of the chosen people till the time of their final glory (comp. Zechariah 1:16). There is some difficulty in arranging the details of this vision, depending in great measure on the decision we arrive at with regard to the identification of the \"young man\" of ver. 4. Those who, as Theodoret, Hitzig, Schegg, Trcehon, Wright, Perowne, etc., consider him to be the man with the measuring line of ver. 1, do not explain why the message should be given to him instead of to the prophet who had asked for information. Nor is it at all certain that the measurer is meant to be regarded as having made a mistake in attempting to define the limits of what was practically unlimited - viz. the restored Jerusalem - and was stopped accordingly in his proceedings. It seems preferable, with Jerome, Cornelius a Lapide, Pusey, Keil, Knabenbauer, etc., to regard the \"young man\" as Zechariah himself. Then the vision is thus presented: The prophet sees a man with a measuring line; he asks whither he is going, and is answered that he was going forth to measure Jerusalem. Upon this the interpreting angel leaves the prophet's side to receive the explanation of the man's proceedings, and is met by a superior angel, who bids him hasten to tell the prophet the meaning of the vision. A man. Probably an angel in human form, as Zechariah 1:8. A measuring line. This is not the same word as that in Zechariah 1:16; but the idea there proposed is taken up here, and its fulfilment is set forth (comp. Ezekiel 11:3; Revelation 11:1; Revelation 21:15, 16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - What is the breadth thereof. The man measures to see what shall be the dimensions of the restored city, for from ver. 12 it is apparent that the building is not yet completed, nor are we to think that the rebuilding of the material ruined walls is meant.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Went forth. The interpreting angel leaves the prophet, and goes away to meet another angel who advances from the opposite side. Septuagint, εἰστήκει, \"stood.\" Another angel went out; went forth, the word being the same as before. This latter angel, sent by God with a revelation, is superior to the interpreter, as the latter receives the message from him to deliver to the prophet.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - And said unto him; i.e. the second angel said to the interpreter. Run. He was to hasten and deliver the message, because it was a joyful one and calculated to allay the prophet's solicitude. This young man. The Prophet Zechariah. The term applied to him is thought to show that he was still young when the vision appeared; but the word is used also for minister, or servant, or disciple, without necessarily defining the age. Others, not so suitably, consider that the measuring angel is meant, who is thus stopped in his intention of measuring Jerusalem, as being ignorant of God's counsels. Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls. Jerusalem shall be as open villages in a plain country. The word perazoth is used in Ezekiel 38:11, meaning \"unwalled villages\" where men dwelt \"without walls, having neither bars nor gates.\" So Esther 9:19, where it means, \"country towns,\" in contrast to the metropolis, which was walled and fortified. The idea in the text is that Jerusalem in the future shall be so extended that walls shall no longer contain its inhabitants, but they shall spread themselves in the open country on every side. It is certain that the city did greatly increase in after time, if we may believe Aristeas's account in his famous letter to his brother Philocrates; and the annunciation of this prosperity would be a comfort to the prophet (comp. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). But no material increase of this nature satisfies the prophecy, which can only have its fulfilment in the spiritual Jerusalem, whose Builder is Christ, in whose light the nations of them that are saved shall walk (Revelation 21:24; see Isaiah 49:18, etc.; Isaiah 54:2, 3). This open condition implies not only extent, but peace and safety also. The reason of this quiet security is given in the next verse. Septuagint, Κατακάρπως κατοικηθήσεται Ἰερουσαλὴμ, \"Jerusalem shall be abundantly inhabited.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - A wall of fire. She will not need walls. God will be her protection, not only defending her from attack, but consuming the enemy who may presume to assault her (comp. Deuteronomy 4:24; Psalm 68:2). The glory; εἰς δόξαν ἔσομαι (Septuagint). God will make his glory conspicuous by the mighty deeds he will do in Jerusalem and the providential care he will take of her. He shall be known to be dwelling there, as he revealed his presence by the pillar of fire and the Shechinah (comp. Isaiah 60:1, 2, 19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHo, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The superior angel of ver. 4 continues to speak. He calls on all the Hebrews still in dispersion to come and share this glorious state and escape the punishment which was about to fall upon the hostile kingdom. The exaltation of Jerusalem is connected with the downfall of her enemies. Ho, ho, come forth, and flee; Hebrew, \"Ho, ho I and flee,\" or, \"flee thou\" (comp. Isaiah 48:20; Jeremiah 51:6, 45.) A great number of the exiles had remained in Babylonia, having established themselves there, according to the injunction in Jeremiah 29:5, etc., and grown rich. These people had refused to exchange their present prosperity for the doubtful future offered by a return to their desolate native land. But they are now called upon to \"flee\" from the danger that menaced the country of their adoption. Babylon is said to have been twice taken in the reign of Darius (see note on ver. 7). The land of the north; i.e. Babylonia (comp. Jeremiah 1:14; Jeremiah 4:6; Jeremiah 23:8). We should have nailed the Babylonians an Eastern people if we had dwelt in Palestine; but they always invaded this land from the north, and the great caravan route entered the country from the same quarter, so they were deemed to he a northern power. I have spread you abroad as the four winds (Ezekiel 17:21). The Jews had been dispersed through all parts of the extensive Babylonian empire, and that with a violence which is compared to the force of the combined winds of heaven. Keil, Wright, and others regard the words as a promise of future extension only to be obtained by a return to the promised land, translating, \"I will spread you,\" the perfect of the text being taken to express prophetic certainty. But it is surely incongruous to comfort the dispersed Jews by the promise of a still wider dispersion. This appears to be as erroneous as the Septuagint rendering of the verb, συνάξω, \"I will gather.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTDeliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Deliver thyself. Escape from the danger. O Zion. The exiled Jews are thus designated. Septuagint, Αἰς Σιὼν ἀνασώζεσθε \"Go to Zion, and save yourselves.\" That dwellest (thou that dwellest) with the daughter of Babylon. The inhabitants of Babylon are called \"the daughter of Babylon,\" in analogy with the common phrases, \"the daughter of Zion,\" \"the daughter of Jerusalem\" (comp. Jeremiah 46:19). There is soma reproach implied in the clause, as if these Jews were content to dwell and remain in this heathen city. The immediate danger that menaced Babylon arose from two severe rebellions, in the course of which the city was twice taken. The first revolt was headed by Nidinta-Bel, B.C. 519, who was slain by Darius at Babylon. The second took place under Arakha, B.C. 514; he was defeated by a general of Darius, named Intaphernes, taken prisoner and crucified. A record of these occurrences is found in Darius's inscription on the rock at Behlstun, translated in 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. The merciless Persians would doubtless treat the inhabitants of the captured city with their wonted cruelty.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - After the glory hath he sent me. After glory (there is no article in the original), i.e. to win honour, hath Jehovah sent me - the superior angel who speaks. As the words, \"thus saith the Lord,\" precede, we should have expected, \"have I sent thee,\" but such change of persons, and indirect address, are common in Hebrew (comp. Zechariah 14:5). The angel is sent to get glory over the heathen by taking vengeance on them (comp. Exodus 14:18). Such judgments are often represented to be inflicted by angelic agency (Genesis 19:13; 2 Kings 19:35; Ezekiel 9.) The apple of his eye. The language is human. Israel is very precious to God; and they who vex and harass him are as they who hurt that which God prizes inestimably, and which a mere touch offends and injures. The word rendered \"apple\" is usually considered in mean \"aperture,\" or \"gate,\" the pupil being the entrance to the visual organ; but Dr. Wright regards it rather as a natural word of endearment, like the Latin, pupa, pupilla, indicating \"a doll,\" \"little maiden of the eye.\" Similar, though not identical, expressions occur in Deuteronomy 32:10; Proverbs 7:2; Psalm 17:8.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - I will shake mine hand upon (over) them. The angel reports Jehovah's message now in the first person, or speaks as the representative of Jehovah. The action of shaking the hand over a nation is one of menace (Job 31:21; Isaiah 11:15; Isaiah 19:16). Shall be a spoil to their servants; to their slaves, those who once served them. This was true only in a spiritual sense, when the nations were won over to the true faith (see ver. 11; and comp. Isaiah 14:2; Isaiah 49:22, etc.; Ezekiel 16:61). Septuagint, τοῖς δουλεύουσιν αὐτοῖς, \"to them that serve them.\" Ye shall know, etc. (Zechariah 4:9; Zechariah 6:15). When this comes to pass, the Israelites shall recognize and own the Divine mission of God's messenger.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Sing and rejoice. The Jews released from Babylon, and the whole Jewish nation, are bidden to exult in the promised protection and presence of the Lord. Lo, I come; Septuagint, ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἔρχομαι, So Christ is called, ὁ ἐρχόμενος, \"he that cometh\" (Matthew 11:3). I will dwell in the midst of thee (Zechariah 8:3; Zechariah 9:9). Not merely the rebuilding of the temple is siginified, and the re-establisihment of the ordained worship (though without the Shechinah), but rather the incarnation of Christ and his perpetual presence in the Church. Κατασκηνώσω ἐν μέσῳ σου (Septuagint), which recalls John 1:14, \"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt (ἐσκήνωσεν) among us\" (comp. Isaiah 12:6; Ezekiel 43:9; Ezekiel 48:35; Malachi 3:1).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Many nations shall be joined (shall join themselves) to the Lord; \"shall fly for refuge unto the Lord\" (Septuagint). My people; unto me for a people; Septuagint, \"shall be unto him for a people\" (comp. Zechariah 8:20). No mere conversion of individuals among the heathen satisfies this promise. Whole nations shall become the Lord's people. That title shall be shared with Israel by countless multitudes (comp, Isaiah 2:2, 3; Isaiah 11:10; Micah 4:2; Zephaniah 2:11), I will dwell, etc. The promise of ver. 10 is repeated for assurance' sake. The LXX. has, \"And they shall dwell in the midst of thee.\" Thou shalt know (as ver. 9).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah2:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12 - Shall inherit Judah. The Lord, though it is true that many other nations shall be converted, shall take Judah (i.e. the whole Jewish nation) as his portion, in accordance with Deuteronomy 32:9. In the holy land. This expression is not found elsewhere applied to Judaea, nor is it to be confined to that nation here. Every land is holy where the Lord dwells. The conversion of the heathen should emanate from Judaea (Luke 24:47), and spread through all the world, and thus the earth should be holy ground. Shall choose Jerusalem again; Revised Version, \"shall yet choose Jerusalem\" (comp. Zechariah 1:17).

He had seemed to sleep when he let his people be trodden down by the heathen; but now he, as it were, waketh and cometh from heaven, his holy habitation (Deuteronomy 26:15), to inflict the threatened judgment on the nations, and to succour his own people (comp. Psalm 44:23, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.3":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-10. - § 6. The fourth vision: Joshua the high priest before the angel. Verse 1. - He showed me. The Septuagint and Vulgate give, \"The Lord showed me.\" Some suppose that it was the interpreting angel who showed this vision; but his duty was to explain, not to present, the visions. So in Zechariah 1:20 it is the Lord who shows the \"four craftsmen.\" This vision is closely connected with the last. In that it was declared that the Lord would again dwell in Jerusalem, and visit his people with blessings. But to fit them for the presence and favour of Jehovah they must be pure. To this end they must have a holy priesthood to train them in righteous ways, to oppose the attacks of the adversary, and to intercede for them effectually. The removal of their impurity is represented in the fourth vision. Joshua the high priest (see note on Haggai 1:1). The name is written Joshua in Ezra 2:2, etc. He was the first of the high priests after the Captivity, succeeding, as by hereditary right, his father Josedech, who died in Babylon. For his services in restoring the temple he is praised among great men in Ecclus. 49:12. Standing before the angel of the Lord. Joshua is the representative of the priesthoood, and through that also of the whole people. The angel of Jehovah (see notes on Zechariah 1:11, 13) is the representative of and endowed with attributes of Jehovah, the Friend and Leader of Israel. The phrase, \"standing before,\" is used in a ministerial sense, as of a servant rendering service to a superior (Genesis 41:46; 1 Kings 12:6, 8), and a priest or Levite performing his official duties (Deuteronomy 10:8; Ezekiel 44:15) : also, in a judicial sense, of a person appearing before a judge, either as plaintiff (Numbers 27:2; 1 Kings 3:16) or defendant (Numbers 35:12). Many commentators find in this scene a judicial process, Joshua appearing before the angel as before his judge; and Ewald supposes that it adumbrates his actual accusation at the Persian court, The mention of the adversary at the right hand (Psalm 109:6) is supposed to confirm this interpretation. But it is obvious that the adversary might stand at the right hand, not as a formal accuser in a trial, but in order to resist and hinder Joshua's proceedings; the angel, too, is not represented as sitting on a throne of judgment, but standing by (ver. 5), and there is no further intimation of any judicial process in the vision. It is therefore best to conceive that Joshua is interceding for the people in his official capacity in the presence of the representative of Jehovah. The locality is not specified; it may have been before the altar, which, we know, was built and used at this time. The special mention of his garments implies that he was engaged in official duties in a consecrated spot; but the place is immaterial. Satan; the adversary, or accuser. The personality of Satan is here plainly recognized, as in Job 1:6, etc.; Job 2:1, etc., rendered by the LXX. in all these places, ὁ διάβολος (see Appendix B, in Archdeacon Perowne's 'Commentary on Zechariah'). At his (Joshua's) right hand. Not as a judicial accuser, but as an enemy to resist his efforts for the good of the people, and to thwart his interests with the angel of the Lord. To resist him; to act the adversary to him. The verb is cognate to, the noun above. From what follows we must suppose that Satan objects against Joshua both his own personal sin and the transgressions of the people whose burden he bore (comp. ver. 9, where his sin is called \"the iniquity of the land,\" which would include the guilt which had led to the Captivity, their dilatoriness in building the temple, and all their backslidings since the return).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - The Lord said. The Angel of Jehovah speaks. The appellations are often here used interchangeably. The Lord rebuke thee. The Lord's rebuke falls with effect where it is directed; it paralyzes the hostile power (comp. Psalm 106:9; Nahum 1:4). Satan's accusation may have been well founded, but it sprang from malice, and was directed against the people whom God was receiving into favour, and therefore it was rejected and rendered innocuous. Some commentators have supposed that St. Jude is alluding to this passage when (ver. 9) he quotes the words of Michael contending about the body of Moses, \"The Lord rebuke thee:\" but it is more probable that Jude is referring to some rabbinical tradition, or to the apocryphal 'Assumption of Moses' (see the matter examined in Dissertation I. of Dr. Gloag's 'Introduction to the Catholic Epistles'). That hath chosen Jerusalem (Zechariah 1:17; Zechariah 2:12). God's election of Israel and renewed acceptance of her is the reason why Satan's accusation is rejected (Deuteronomy 7:7, 8). She is not to be abandoned to the consequences of her sins, nor were God's gracious purposes towards her to be frustrated. \"God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew;\" and, \"Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?\" (Romans 8:33; Romans 11:2, 29). This. This man, Joshua, saved from his father's and grandfather's fate (see on Haggai 1:1), a type of the deliverance of Israel. A brand plucked out of the fire. Israel had been already punished by defeat, captivity, distress, and misery. From these evils, which had almost destroyed her, she had been delivered; and the deliverance would be completed; she should not be cast again into the fire (see Amos 4:11, and note there). The expression is proverbial (comp. 1 Corinthians 3:15; Jude 1:23).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTNow Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Clothed with filthy garments. The soiled, or dark mourning garments represent not so much the low estate to which the Aaronic priesthood had been reduced, as the defilements of sin with which Joshua was encompassed, especially, perhaps, his error in allowing his descendants to intermarry with heathens (Ezra 10:18). But the sin was not only personal; he appeared laden with the guilt of the priesthood and his people. He is a type of Christ in this. Christ, indeed, was without sin; yet he bare our sins in his own body on the tree, and was made sin for us (Romans 8:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Some consider that the soiled garments denote the mean address in which an accused person appeared in court. But this is to import a Roman custom (comp. Livy, 2:54; 6:20) into Hebrew practice. Others deem it incongruous to make a high priest violate the decency of his office by officiating in unclean apparel. But the violation of propriety was a requirement of the vision, that thus the defilement of sin might be symbolical. He stood before the angel. To ask his aid and protection (ver. 4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - He answered. The Angel of Jehovah answered the mute petition of Joshua. Those that stood before him. The attendant angels, who waited on the Angel of Jehovah to do his pleasure (see note on ver. 1). Take away the filthy garments. This symbolized remission of sins and restoration to favour, as the following words explain, I will clothe thee with change of raiment; Revised Version, with rich apparel. The word machalatsoth occurs also in Isaiah 3:22, and may mean either \"change of raiment,\" or \"costly raiment;\" or the meanings may be combined in the sense of \"festal robes,\" only worn on great occasions and changed after the occasion. They are used here as symbols of righteousness and glory. Not only is the sin pardoned, but the wearer is restored to the full glory of his state. The LXX. makes the words to be addressed to the attendants, \"Clothe ye him in a robe flowing to the feet\" (ποδήρη, the word used for Aaron's priestly garment, Exodus 28:4; Ecclus. 45:8).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - I said. If this is the true reading (which Ewald doubts), we must consider that the prophet, excited by what has passed, cannot stand by as a mere spectator, but feels constrained to take part in the scene, and to request that the change of garments may be completed by the addition of the fair head dress. The LXX. omits the word, continuing the address to the attendant. The Vulgate has, et dixit. So the Syriac and the Targum and some few manuscripts. But the received reading is confirmed, as Dr. Alexander points out, by the change in the mood of the following verb from the imperative to the optative, \"let them put,\" \"would that they put.\" There is nothing incongruous in the prophet thus intervening in his own person. Thus Isaiah, in the midst of a solemn vision, gives vent to his feelings (Isaiah 6:5), and St. John in the Apocalypse often mingles his own sentiments and actions with what he beheld (comp. Revelation 5:4; Revelation 10:9; Revelation 11:1). Mitre (tsaniph); Septuagint, κίδαριν: so the Vulgate, cidarim. This is not the same word as that used in Exodus 28:4, etc. (which is mitsnepheth), for the official head dress of Aaron, though it is probably a synonym for it; and the prophet's wish is to see Joshua not only reinstated in his office and dignity, but found holy also. For the fair linen mitre, or tiara, was that which bore upon its front the golden plate inscribed, \"Holiness unto the Lord\" (Exodus 28:36-38), and therefore showed that he was qualified to intercede for the people. Stood by. The Angel of Jehovah continued standing in his place, contemplating, sanctioning, and directing what was being done.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - Protested. Solemnly and earnestly admonished, adjured. Διεμαρτίρατο (Septuaguit); Genesis 43:3; 2 Kings 17:13. The Angel sets before Joshua his duties, and urges him to keep in the right way, promising to him and to the nation blessing and honour, and proceeding to prophesy of a great future.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Walk in my ways. God's ways are his commandments, as the next words explain (comp. 1 Kings 3:14). Keep my charge. The Vulgate retains the Hebraism, Custodiam meam custodieris (comp. Genesis 26:5; Malachi 3:14). The charge means the laws and ordinances of the Mosaic institution. Then. The apodosis rightly begins here, though Kimchi and others make it commence at \"I will give thee,\" taking the following two clauses as denoting parts of his duties, the observance of which conditioned his acceptance. Thou shalt also judge my house. The mention of \"my courts\" in the following clause requires that \"house\" here should mean, not people or family, but, in a more restricted sense, the temple, looked upon as the spiritual centre of the nation. If the high priest kept the ordinances and commandments, he should rule and order Divine worship, and \"judge,\" i.e. govern, the ministers of the sanctuary. Keep my courts. He was to preserve the temple, and that which the temple represented, from all idolatry and ungodliness. This duty, as Hengstenberg observes, is introduced as a reward, because it was an honour and a privilege to be entrusted with such an office, and the greatest favour which God could confer upon man. Places to walk. The LXX. takes the word as a participle, translating, ἀναστερεφομένους, \"persons walking;\" so the Syriac; Vulgate, ambulantes. This is explained to mean that God will give him out of the band of angels (ver. 4), some to accompany and aid him in his ministrationS. But the word is best taken as a noun meaning \"walks,\" \"goings.\" The Revised Version gives, \"a place of access\" in the text, restoring the Authorized Version in the margin; but there seems to be no good reason for the Revised rendering. The translation, \"goings,\" \"walks,\" gives much the same signification, and is consonant with the use of the word elsewhere (comp. Nehemiah 2:6; Ezekiel 42:4; Jonah 3:9, 4). It means that Joshua should have free access to God. The gloss of the Targum, that it is here intimated that the high priest should be admitted to the company of the angels after the resurrection, is unsuitable, as the other parts of the promise have respect to this present world. Among these that stand by; i.e. among the attendant angels who wait upon God to do his will, and a company of whom were gathered round the Angel of Jehovah in the vision (see ver. 4). It is natural piety to believe that the hosts of heaven join in the worship of the Church on earth, and assist godly ministers with their presence and fellowship. Here is adumbrated that access to God which the Christian enjoys in Christ (John 14:6; Ephesians 2:18). This is more fully revealed in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTHear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Hear now; ἄκουε δή (Septuagint). Joshua is called upon to give all his attention to the important announcement that follows, which promises a very great boon in the future. Thy fellows that sit before thee. His fellow priests, who took their orders from him and sat with him in council (comp. 2 Kings 4:38; Ezekiel 8:1, etc.). These priests were not seen in the vision. Keil considers that the address, to which Joshua's attention is called, begins at \"Thou and thy fellows.\" For (or, yea) they are men wondered at; Septuagint, διότι ἄνδρες τερατοσκόποι εἰσί, \"men observers of wonders;\" Vulgate, Quia viri portendentes sunt (see Isaiah 8:18). The phrase would be better rendered, \"men of portent, sign, or type.\" Revised Version gives, \"men which are a sign,\" i.e. who foreshadow some future events, whose persons, office, duties, typify and look forward to good things to come. I will bring forth my Servant the BRANCH. This is why they are called typical men, because God is making the antitype to appear. The word rendered \"branch\" (tsemach) is translated by the Septuagint ἀνατολήν, which is used in the sense of \"shoot\" as well as \"sunrise\" (see Jeremiah 23:5; Ezekiel 16:7; Ezekiel 17:10), and by the Vulgate, orientem. So the Syriac and Arabic (comp. Luke 1:78). Most interpreters rightly see here a reference to the Messiah. Some few have fancied that Zerubbabel and Nehemiah are meant; but the appellation, \"my Servant Branch,\" has already been applied in prophetical language to Messiah, and cannot be distorted to any inferior subject, such as a mere civil ruler. Messiah is often called the Lord's \"Servant,\" e.g. Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 43:10; Isaiah 52:13, etc. And the terms, \"Branch,\" or \"Rod,\" or \"Shoot,\" referring to Messiah, are found in Isaiah 4:2; Isaiah 11:1; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:15. From the depressed house of David a scion should spring, in whom all that was prophesied concerning the priesthood and kingdom of Israel should find its accomplishment.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - For behold. This gives the reason why the \"Branch\" is brought forth; the Church is to be firmly established and all iniquity to be abolished. The stone that I have laid (set) before Joshua. In the vision a stone is seen lying at the feet of Joshua, either the foundationstone of the temple, say the commentators, or the cornerstone, or the coping; or, as the Talmud testifies, a stone that rose some three fingers' measure above the ground, and upon which the high priest used to set the censer of incense. But it was more probably none of these, but some rough, unhewed block, not yet polished or fitted into its place. What does it represent? Many critics of note answer at once, the Messiah. He who was above called \"Branch\" is now called the \"Stone.\" And certainly this term in applied unto him in prophetical language, as in Isaiah 28:16; Psalm 118:22; and references are made to the appellation is the New Testament as to a well known title, e.g. Matthew 21:42; Ephesians 2:20. But there are objections to taking this as the primary sense. As Knabenbauer points out, it is not likely that in one verse the Lord's Servant Branch is said to be destined to be brought forth, and in the next the same is called the stone which is set before Joshua and has to be graven by a hand Divine. Besides, if both terms mean Messiah, we have the very lame conclusion: I will bring Messiah because I have already placed him before Joshua. The stone, too, is represented as somewhat under the management of Joshua, and needing graving and polishing, neither of which facts apply to the Messiah. Putting out of sight other interpretations which are all more or less inadmissible, we shall be safest in considering the stone to represent the theocracy, the spiritual kingdom of Israel, now indeed lying imperfect and unpolished before Joshua, but ordained to become beautiful and extensive and admirable. So Daniel (Daniel 2:35, 45) speaks of the stone cut out of the mountains without hands, which filled the whole earth, a figure of the Church and kingdom of God, small in its beginning, but in the end establishing its rule over the world. Upon one stone; LXX., ἐπὶ τὸν λίθον τὸν ἕνα, \"upon the one stone.\" The stone is termed \"one\" in contrast with the number seven that follows. Shall be (are) seven eyes. Upon this stone the eyes of God are directed in watchful care (comp. Zechariah 4:10; and for the phrase, see 1 Kings 8:29; Psalm 33:18; Psalm 34:15; Jeremiah 39:12). \"Seven\" is the number of perfection, and may denote here the infinite care which God takes of his Church, even as St. John in the Revelation (Revelation 1:4; Revelation 5:6) beheld the Lamb \"having seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.\" The expression is metaphorical, and we are not to suppose, with Ewald, that the eyes were graven on the stone, or that Zechariah derived his notion from the tenets of Zoroaster or the degrees of rank in the Persian court. There may be an allusion to the seven gifts of the Spirit with which Messiah is anointed (Isaiah 11:2), and which animate and strengthen his body, the Church. I will engrave the graving thereof. As God engraved the tables of the Law (Exodus 32:16). I will out and polish this rough stone to fit it for its place in the temple. The verb is used of the bold engraving and ornamentation of stonework, the finishing which it undergoes to perfect its preparation (comp. 1 Kings 7:36; 2 Chronicles 2:7; 2 Chronicles 3:7). Those who regard the stone as typifying the Messiah, see in this clause an intimation of the Passion of Christ, who \"was wounded for our transgressions.\" The LXX. has, \"I dig a trench,\" which Jerome explains of the wounds of Christ on the cross. I will remove the iniquity of that land. The shaping of the stone involves the bestowal of purity and holiness. God will pardon the inhabitants of the land of Israel, and make them a holy nation (Jeremiah 33:7, 8). But the promise stretches far beyond the limits primarily assigned to it. In one day. The day when Christ died for the sins of men. There is an allusion to the great Day of Atonement, when the high priest went once a year into the holy of holies with the blood of sacrifice. This, however, was an imperfect reconciliation, and had to be repeated annually. \"But Christ being come an High Priest of the good things to come... through his own blood entered in once for all (ἐφάπαξ) into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption Now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself\" (Hebrews 9:11-26; comp. Hebrews 7:27; Hebrews 10:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah3:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Shall ye call every man his neighbour, etc. In this cleansed and purified kingdom shall be found peace, happiness, and plenty, recalling the prosperous days of Solomon (1 Kings 4:25). (For a similar picture of prosperity, see Micah 4:4, and note there.) This is fulfilled in Christ, who says to his true disciples, \"Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you\" (John 14:27). Dr. Wright notes, \"We are told in the Talmud ('Yoma,' 7:4) that when, on the great Day of Atonement, the high priest had performed the various duties of that solemn day, he was escorted home in a festive manner, and was accustomed to give a festal entertainment to his friends. The maidens and youths of the people went forth to their gardens and vineyards with songs and dances; social entertainments took place on all sides, and universal gladness closed the festival of that solemn day.\"NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.4":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-14. - 7. The fifth vision: the golden candlestick. Verse 1. - The angel that talked with me. The interpreting angel is meant. Came again, and waked me. It is thought that the angel, who is said (Zechariah 2:3) to have gone forth, now rejoined the prophet and renewed his colloquy with him. But the expression in the text is probably only equivalent to \"aroused me again\" (comp. Genesis 26:18; 2 Kings 1:11, 13, etc.). Absorbed in awe and wonder at the contemplation of the preceding vision, the prophet had fallen into a state of exhaustion and torpor, as Daniel slept after his great visions (Daniel 8:18; Daniel 10:8, 9), and the apostles were heavy with sleep on the Mount of Transfiguration (Luke 9:32). From this mental prostration the angel arouses him to renewed attention. Or what is meant may be that the change wrought on the faculties by the Divine influence was as great as that between natural sleeping and waking.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd said unto me, What seest thou?

The angel does not show the vision to the prophet, but makes him describe it, and then explains its import. This vision of the candlestick, with its seven lamps fed by two olive trees, signifies that the work of rebuilding the temple, and preparing the way for the Church of the true Israel, was to be accomplished by relying, not on human resources, but on Divine aid. Thus were Zerubbabel and his people roused to perseverance and energy in their good work, of which the final sucess is assured. I have looked; ἑώρακα (Septuagint), \"I have seen.\" A candlestick all of gold. The candelabrum as described differs in some particulars from that in the tabernacle, though the same word, menorath, is used in both cases (Exodus 25:31; Exodus 37:17, etc.). In Solomon's temple there were ten candelabra (1 Kings 7:49), which were carried away to Babylon when Jerusalem was taken (Jeremiah 52:19). The single candelabrum of Zerubbabel's temple is mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:21 1 Macc. 4:49, 50. The one sculptured on the arch of Titus may be a truthful representation of that in Herod's temple, but probably is not the same as that in the second edifice (comp. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:04, 4). The candelabrum in the vision differed from the original one in three particulars: it had a central reservoir; it had also seven pipes; and it was supplied with oil by two olive trees. With a (its) howl upon the top of it. The \"bowl\" (gullah) is a reservoir for oil placed at the top of the candelabrum; and from it tubes led the oil for the supply of the lamps. In the tabernacle each lamp was separate, and trimmed and filled by the ministering priests; the mystic lamps needed no human agency to keep them supplied. They were fed by the \"bowl.\" The word is translated in the Septuagint, λαμπάδιον: in the Vulgate, lampas; hence some have supposed that, besides the seven lamps, there was another large light in the centre; but the Greek and Latin rendering is mistaken, the word meaning \"a fountain\" (Joshua 15:19), or \"a ball\" (1 Kings 7:41), or \"a round bowl\" (Ecclesiastes 12:6). And seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof. The Hebrew is, literally rendered, seven and seven pipes to the lamps which are upon its top. The LXX. translates, Καὶ ἑπτὰ ἐπαρυστρίδες τοῖς λύχνοις τοῖς ἐπάνω αὐτῆς, \"And seven vessels for the lamps which are upon it;\" so the Vulgate, Septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput ejus. These versions imply that there was one supply pipe to each of the lamps, which seems most natural. In this case, the first \"seven\" in the text must be an interpolation. Commentators who regard the present reading as correct have taken various ways in explaining it. Some multiply the number into itself, and make the pipes forty-nine; but this is unwarranted by Hebrew usage (Henderson). Others add the numbers together, making fourteen; but here again the copulative vau, which implies diversity, is an objection. The Revised Version has, \"There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, taking the words distributively; but the number of tubes seems here to be unnecessarily large. Dr. Wright considers that there were two pipes to each lamp, one set connecting each to the central bowl, and one connecting the several lamps together. One, however, does not see of what particular use the second set is. Dr. Wright, p. 84, gives a drawing of the candelabrum with its appurtenances, according to his notion of the vision. The Authorized Version seems to give the correct idea of the passage, whether we arrive at it by rejecting the first \"seven,\" or by considering that it is repeated for emphasis' sake, as Cornelius Lapide and Pressel think: \"Seven are the lamps upon it - seven, I say, and seven the pipes.\" Take it as we may, the point is that the oil is well and copiously supplied to the several lights.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Two olive trees. These, as explained in ver. 12, discharged the oil from their fruit-bearing branches into conduits which led to the central reservoir. Without man's agency the oil is separated from the berry and keeps the lamps constantly supplied (comp. Revelation 2:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - What are these, my lord?

The Lord's message unto Zerubbabel is the purport of the vision, viz. that his work will be accomplished through the grace of God alone. Not by might. Septuagint, \"not by great might;\" but the Vulgate, \"not by an army.\" The word is almost synonymous with the following, translated power; and the two together mean that the effect is to be produced, not by any human means, however potent. Doubtless Zerubbabel was dispirited when he thought how much there was to do, how feeble the means at his disposal (Nehemiah 4:2), and how formidable the opposition; and nothing could better reassure him than the promise of Divine aid. But by my Spirit. The angel does not say expressly what is to be done; but the purpose that filled the minds of Zechariah and Zerubbabel applied the word. The operations of the Spirit are manifold, and his aid alone could bring these mighty things to pass. The oil is a figure of the grace of the Holy Spirit; and as the lamps are not supplied by human hands, but directly from the olives, so the good work now undertaken shall be supported by Divine means (see on ver. 14).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWho art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Who art thou, O great mountain? The \"mountain\" is a figurative expression to denote the various difficulties that stood in Zerubbabel's way and impeded the carrying out of his great design. Before Zerubbabel. The Vulgate affixes these words to the former part of the clause, but the accent is in favour of the Authorized Version. Thou Shall become a plain; literally, into a plain! A command. All obstacles shall be removed (comp. Isaiah 40:4; Isaiah 49:11; Matthew 17:20; Luke 3:4, 5). Septuagint, τοῦ κατορθῶσαι (intrans.), \"that thou shouldst prosper;\" \"ut corrigas\" (Jerome). He shall bring forth the headstone thereof. \"He\" is evidently Zerubbabel. He shall commence and put the finishing stroke to the work of rebuilding the temple. Many commentators take this stone to be the one that completes the building, \"the topstone.\" But it may well be questioned whether a building like the temple could have any such stone. An arch or a pyramid may have a crowning stone, but no other edifice; nor is there any proof that such a topstone was known or its erection celebrated. It may be a mere metaphor for the completion of the work. It is better, however, to take it as the cornerstone, to which we know great importance was attached (comp. Job 38:6; Psalm 118:22, etc.). This stone, on which the building rests, Zerubbabel will bring forth from the workshop; as the next verses say, his hands have laid the foundation. That action, already past, is represented as future, the regular commencement of the work under Zerubbabel's direction being intimated, and its happy conclusion promised. Septuagint, Καὶ ἐξοίσω τὸν λίθον τῆς κληρονομίας, \"And I will bring forth the stone of the inheritance\" - the meaning of which is obscure, though Jerome explains it by considering it an allusion to Christ. With shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it! All the by standers, as the stone is placed, shout in acclamation, \"God's favour rest upon it!\" (Ezra 3:10). The LXX. seems to have mistaken the sense, rendering, Ἰσότητα χάριτος χάριτα αὐτῆς, \"The grace of it the equality of grace\" (John 1:16); and to have led St. Jerome astray, who translates, \"Et exsaequabit gratiam gratiae ejus,\" and comments thus: \"We all have received of his fulness, and grace for grace, that is, the grace of the gospel for the grace of the Law, in order theft the Israelites and the heathen who believe may receive equal grace and a like blessing.\" The Targum recognizes here a Messianic prophecy: \"He will reveal the Messiah whose Name is spoken of from all eternity, and he shall rule over all the kingdoms.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTMoreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - The word of the Lord came unto me. The word came through the interpreting angel, as is clear from the expression in ver. 9, \"The Lord hath sent me unto you.\" He explains more fully what had been already announced figuratively.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Have laid the foundation. Zerubbabel had commenced the rebuilding in the second year of the return, in the second month (Ezra 3:8); it had been hindered by the opposition of the neighbouring people (Ezra 4:1-5, 24), and was not resumed till the second year of Darius. Shall finish it. The temple was finished in Darius's sixth year (Ezra 6:15). Thou shalt know, etc. The truth of the angel's mission would be proved by the event, viz. the successful issue (comp. ch. 2:9, 11; 6:15; Deuteronomy 18:22). The completion of the material temple was a pledge of the establishment of the spiritual temple, the Church of God.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - For who hath despised the day of small things? The \"small things\" are the weak and poor beginning of the temple (Haggai 2:3); as the Targum glosses, \"on account of the edifice, because it was small.\" Small as the present work was, it was a pledge of the full completion, and was therefore not to be despised. So the question is equivalent to, \"Can any one, after these promises and prophecies, presume to be doubtful about the future?\" For they shall rejoice, etc. The subject of the verbs is that which comes last in position, the seven eyes of Jehovah; and the verse is best translated thus: \"For (i.e. seeing that) these seven eyes of Jehovah, which run through all the earth, behold with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.\" The work is not contemptible, since the Lord regards it with favour, watches, and directs it. The LXX. and Vulgate (followed nearly by the Authorized Version) make the despisers the subject of the verbs, and lamely dissociate the final clause entirely from the preceding. The version given above is in accordance with the Masoretic accentuation. The plummet; literally, the stone, the tin; τὸν λίθον τὸν κασσιτέρινον (Septuagint); lapidem stanneum, \"the stone of tin\" (Vulgate). Tin is not found in Palestine; it was imported by the Phoenicians in great abundance, and from them the Jews obtained it. The supply must have come from Spain or Britain. With those seven. The preposition is an interpolation of the Authorized Version. It should be, \"even these seven,\" explaining who are \"they\" at the head of the clause. The eyes of the Lord. The \"seven eyes\" have been already mentioned (Zechariah 3:9, where see note). They are expressive of God's watchful providence and care. Which run to and fro. This clause further enforces the previous image (2 Chronicles 16:9; Proverbs 15:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Then answered I. The prophet had received a general explanation of the vision; he had probably understood that the candelabrum represented the theocracy, of whose restoration and life the temple was the symbol and vehicle. One point was still obscure, and he asks, What are these two olive trees? (ver. 3). To this question no answer is immediately forthcoming, the answer being delayed in order to augment the prophet's desire of understanding the vision, and to induce him to make the question more definite.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The prophet perceives the chief point in the mystic olive trees, so he alters his question the second time, asking, What be these two olive branches? (shibbolim); Vulgate, spicae, \"ears,\" as of corn, so called, as Kimchi supposes, because they were full of berries, as the ears are full of grains of corn. Which through the two golden pipes, etc.; rather, which by means of two golden tubes are emptying the golden oil out of themselves. The oil dropped of itself from the fruit-bearing branches into two tubes, spouts, or channels, which conveyed it to the central reservoir. The Revised Version renders, \"which are beside the two golden spouts;\" like the Vulgate, quae sunt juxta duo rostra aurea. The LXX. has, οἱ κλάδοι οἱ ἐν ταῖς χεροὶ τῶν δύο μυξωτήρων (\"beaks,\" \"noses\") τῶν χρυσῶν - where \"in the hands\" or \"by the hands\" may be a Hebraism for \"by means of.\" The golden oil; Hebrew, the gold. The oil is so called from its colour. The Greek and Latin versions lose this idea altogether, In quibus sunt suffusoria ex auro (Vulgate); \"leading to the golden vessels\" (Septuagint).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Knowest thou not? (comp. ver. 5). The angel wishes to impress upon the prophet whence came the power of the theocracy and the Divine order manifested therein.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah4:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The two anointed ones; literally, the two sons of oil; so the Revised Version; Vulgate, filii olei; Septuagint, υἱοὶ τῆς πιότητος, \"sons of fatness\" (comp. Isaiah 5:1). By them are intended the two powers, the regal and the sacerdotal, through which God's help and protection are dispensed to the theocracy. Oil was used in appointing to both these offices (comp. Leviticus 21:10; 1 Samuel 10:1). The expression, \"son of,\" in many cases denotes a quality or property, like \"son of Belial,\" \"son of might;\" so here Dr. Alexander considers that \"sons of oil\" means people possessed of oil, oil bearers, channels through which the oil flowed to others. Zerubbabel and Joshua are representatives of the civil and priestly authorities, but the text seems expressly to avoid naming any human agents, in order to show that the symbol must not be limited to individuals. Nor, indeed, must it be confined to the Jewish Church and state; it looks forward to the time when Jew and Gentile shall unite in upholding the Church of God. That stand by the Lord of the whole earth; i.e. ready as his ministers to do him service. There is a reference to this passage in Revelation 11:4, where the \"two witnesses\" are called \"the two olive trees.., standing Before the Lord of the earth\" (Perowne). The vision, as we have seen, prefigures primarily the completion of the temple and the restoration of its worship, and secondly the establishment of the Christian Church by the advent of Messiah. The several parts of the vision may be thus explained. The candelabrum is a symbol of the Jewish Church and theocracy, in accordance with the imagery in the Apocalypse, where the seven candlesticks are seven Churches (Revelation 1:20). It is made of gold as precious in God's sight, and to be kept pure and unalloyed; it is placed in the sanctuary, and has seven lamps, to indicate that it is bright with the grace of God, and is meant to shed its light around at all times, as Christian men are bidden to shine like lights in the world (Matthew 5:16; Philippians 2:15). The oil that supplies the lamps is the grace of God, the influence of the Holy Spirit, which alone enables the Church to shine and to accomplish its appointed work. The two olive trees are the two authorities, viz. the civil and sacerdotal, through which God communicates his grace to the Church; these stand by the Lord Because, instituted by him, they carry out his will in the ordering, guiding, extending, and purifying his kingdom among men. The two olive branches remit their oil into one receptacle, because the two authorities, the regal and priestly, are intimately connected and united, and their action tends to one end, the promotion of God's glory in the salvation of men. In Messiah these offices are united; he is the channel of Divine grace, the source of light to the whole world.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.5":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-4. - § 8. The sixth vision: the flying roll. Verse 1. - Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes; i.e. I lifted up mine eyes again, and saw the vision that follows. The prophet had seen, in the fourth vision, how in the new theocracy the priesthood should be pure and holy; in the fifth how the Church should be restored; he is now shown that sinners should be cut off, that no transgression should be left in the kingdom of God. A flying roll; volumen volans (Vulgate): comp. Ezekiel 2:9, 10. The Hebrews used parchment and leather scrolls for writing; the writing was divided into columns, and when completed the document was rolled round one or two sticks and kept in a case. In the present vision the scroll is unrolled and exhibited in its full length and breadth, showing that it was to be made known to all. Its flight denotes the speedy arrival of the judgment, and, as it is seen in the heaven, so the punishment proceeds from God. Theodotion and Aquila render the word, διφθέρα, \"leather;\" the Septuagint, by mistake, δρέπανον, \"a sickle.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - He said. The angel-interpreter spoke (Zechariah 4:2). The length thereof, etc. Taking the cubit at a foot and a half, the size of the roll is enormous, and may well have aroused the prophet's wonder. The dimensions given correspond to those of the porch of Solomon's temple (1 Kings 6:3), twenty cubits long by ten broad. These are also the dimensions of the holy place in the tabernacle, and of Solomon's brazen altar (2 Chronicles 4:1). The careful statement of the size of the roll indicates that some special meaning is attached to these measurements. We do not know that any symbolical signification was recognized in the porch of the temple; but these dimensions may well contain a reference to the sanctuary and the altar, as Knabenbauer explains, \"The curse is of the same measure as that altar which was the instrument of expiation and reconciliation, and as that sanctuary which was the entrance to the holy of holies.\" Others consider that the curse is pronounced according to the measure of the sanctuary, i.e. according to the Divine Law; or that all might thus know that it came from God, and that the possession of the temple did not secure the people from vengeance unless they were pure and obedient.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - This is the curse. The roll contained the curse written upon it on both sides. (For the curse of fled upon guilty nations, comp. Isaiah 24:6; Daniel 9:11.) Earth; land; for Judaea is meant. The curse was ready to fall on all who might come under it by their transgressions. This would be a warning also to exterior nations. Every one that stealeth...every one that sweareth. Thieves and perjurers are especially mentioned as incurring the curse. Perjury is a chief offence in one table of the Law, theft in the other; so these sins may stand for all offences against the Decalogue (comp. James 2:10, etc.). But probably they are named because they were particularly rife among the returned Jews. Daring their long sojourn in Babylon they had engaged in commercial pursuits and had fallen into the lax morality which such occupations often engender. These bad habits they had brought with them and practised in their new home (comp. ch. 8:17, and note there). Shall be out off as on this side according to it; Revised Version, shall be purged out on the one side (margin, from hence) according to it; Ewald, \"driven hence like it.\" The reference is to the two sides of the roll, answering to the two tables of the Decalogue. Sinners shall be i.e. utterly consumed, cleansed away, i.e. according to the tenor of the roll. The Vulgate has judicabitur; the LXX., ἕως θανάτου ἐκδικηθήσεται \"shall be punished unto death.\" That sweareth; i.e. falsely, as is plain from ver. 4; Septuagint, πᾶς ὁ ἐπίορκος, \"every perjurer.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTI will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - I will bring it forth. God will not keep the curse confined and inoperative (Deuteronomy 32:34, etc.), but it shall enter into the house of the thief. The curse shall not fall lightly and pass quickly by, but shall fix its abode with the sinner till it has worked out its fell purpose. It shall remain; it shall pass the night - take up its lodging; LXX., καταλύσει. With the timber thereof, etc. A hyperbolical expression of the terrible effects of Divine vengeance, which consumes utterly like a devouring fire - an adumbration of the destruction at the day of judgment (comp. Deuteronomy 4:24; Malachi 3:2; Matthew 3:12).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 5-11 - § 9. The seventh vision: the woman in the ephah. Verse 5. - Went forth. While the prophet meditated on the last vision, the interpreting angel retired into the background or among the company of angels; he now comes into view again to explain a new revelation closely connected with the former. That goeth forth. That comes into sight from the surrounding darkness. As the preceding vision denoted that sinners should be extirpated, so the present vision shows how iniquity itself, the very principle of evil, should be removed from the Holy Land.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - What is it? The prophet did not clearly discern the object, or his question may mean, \"What does it signify?\" An ephah; the ephah, as \"the curse\" (ver. 3). The ephah was the largest of the dry measures in use among the Jews, and was equal to six or seven gallons. It was, of course, too small to contain a woman. The LXX. calls it simply \"the measure;\" the Vulgate, amphora; and it must be considered as an imaginary vessel of huge size. It may have a tacit reference to dishonest dealings (comp. Amos 8:5; Micah 6:10). This is their resemblance; literally, this is their eye. The Authorized Version explains the meaning accurately. \"Eye\" is often used for that which is seen, as in Leviticus 13:55, where the Authorized Version has \"colour;\" and Numbers 11:7, where in reference to the manna we read, \"The eve thereof was as the eye of bdellium\" (comp. Ezekiel 1:4, 16). So here the meaning is: This ephah and this whole vision represent the wicked in the land. Some take \"the eye\" to mean the object of sight, that to which they look. But the ephah was not sot forth for all the people to examine. The LXX. and Syriac, from some variation in the reading, have ἀδικία, \"iniquity,\" and some critics have desired to adopt this in the text. But authority and necessity are equally wanting.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - There was lifted up a talent of lead. As the prophet gazed, the leaden cover of the ephah was raised, so that the contents became visible. The word rendered \"talent\" (kikkar) denotes a circle. It is used in Genesis 13:10, 12, for the tract of country of which the Jordan was the centre, and in 1 Samuel 2:36 for a round loaf. Here it means a disc or circular plate which formed the cover of the round shaped ephah. In the next verse it is called, \"the weight of lead.\" And this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah; and there was a woman sitting, etc. When the leaden lid was raised one woman (mulier una, γυνὴ μία) was seen in the measure. She is called \"one,\" as uniting and concentrating in her person all sinners and all sins.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - This is wickedness. This woman is the personification of wickedness. It is very common to find backsliding Israel represented as a faithless and adulterous woman (comp. Isaiah 1:21; Jeremiah 2:20; Hosea 2:5; and the parable of the two women in Ezekiel 23.). He cast it; her - the woman. As the woman rose, or tried to rise, from the ephah, the angel flung her down into it. It is possible, as some commentators suppose, that the ephah into which wickedness is thrust represents the measure of iniquity which, being reached, constrains God to punish (see Genesis 15:16, where the dispossession of the Amorites is postponed till their iniquity is full). The weight of lead; literally, as the LXX., the stone of lead; Vulgate, massam plumbeam. This is the cover of the ephah, that which is called the \"talent of lead\" in the preceding verse. This heavy cover the angel cast upon the mouth of the ephah, in order to confine the woman therein (comp. Genesis 29:2, which passage may explain why the cover is called \"a stone\"). Dr. Wright and some other commentators, referring the passage to theft and perjury alone, consider that the woman held in her hand the leaden weight with which she weighed her gains, and was sitting in the ephah which she used in her traffic; so that she represents dishonesty in the matter of weight and measure. She is punished by the means of the instruments she had used unrighteously; the weight is dashed upon her lying mouth, and the ephah, her throne, is made the vehicle that carries her out of the land. But it seems a mistake to confine the iniquity mentioned to the two special sins of theft and perjury; nor would the talent and the ephah be natural instruments of stealing and false swearing; and the point of the vision is not the punishment of wickedness, but its expulsion from the land. It is true that the pronominal suffix in the mouth thereof is feminine, and that the LXX. makes it refer to the woman, τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς. But it may equally refer to ephah, which is also feminine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 9. - Then lifted I up mine eyes. This is the conclusion of the vision. And looked; and saw. There came out (forth) two women. These two women who now come in sight have been supposed to represent the Assyrians and Babylonians, who wore the agents in the deportation of Israel; or else are considered abettors of the woman in the ephah, who for a time save her from destruction. This latter supposition proceeds on the erroneous idea that wickedness is herein rescued from punishment, whereas the notion that underlies the whole vision is that the Holy Land is purged of wickedness. That the two nations hostile to Israel are represented is an untenable suggestion; for why should they carry off iniquity from Jerusalem and fix it in their own land? Probably by the two women carrying away the evil woman is signified (if the details are capable of explanation) that iniquity brings with it its own destruction and works out its own removal. The wind was in their wings. They were borne along so quickly that they seemed to be carried by the wind; or the wind helped their flight. A stork; Septuagint, ἔποπος, \"the hoopoe;\" Vulgate, milvi. The Authorized Version is certainly correct. The stork is common enough in Palestine, and is reckoned among unclean birds in the Pentateuch (Leviticus 11:19; Deuteronomy 14:18), for which cause some have thought it is here introduced as bearing the sin laden ephah. But its introduction more probably has reference to its migratory habits, the power and rapidity of its flight, and, as some think, to its skill in constructing its nest.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah5:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - To build it (her) an house. The LXX. refers the pronoun to the ephah, but it seems more natural to refer it to a person, the woman. The feminine gender of the original would apply to either. She is carried away from Judaea to have a permanent dwelling in a land more suited to her. Pusey thinks that possibly a temple may be intended, \"a great idol temple, in which the god of this world should be worshipped.\" In the land of Shinar; i.e. the ideal land of unholiness, where the world power first arrayed itself against God in the attempt at Babel. Septuagint, ἐν γῇ Βαβυλῶνος, (Genesis 11:2, etc.). Shinar, equivalent to Sumer in the Assyrian monuments, denotes Lower or Southern Babylon; Accad, Upper or Northern Babylon. And it shall be established. The house shall be firmly fixed there. Others render, \"when it is ready.\" And set there. The gender shows that the woman is meant, not the house: \"And she shall be set there in her own place.\" Thus from the spiritual Zion all wickedness shall be abolished (Zechariah 3:9) and sent to its own place prepared for the enemies of God and holiness. Doubtless, too, a warning is here conveyed to those Jews who still lingered in Babylon, that they were dwelling in a land accursed of God, and were liable to be involved in the fate which pursues ungodliness. Orelli and some others see in these two visions an analogy to the two goats on the Day of Atonement, of which one was sacrificed for the sins of the people, and the other bore away their iniquity to the demons' abode, the wilderness (Leviticus 16.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.6":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - § 10. The eighth vision: the four chariots. Verse 1. - I turned, and lifted up mine eyes (see note on Zechariah 5:1). Four chariots. These are war chariots. The angel explains, in vers. 5, etc., what these chariots mean, how that they represent God's judgments on sinners in all the world. Though evil is removed from the Church, God's vengeance pursues it wherever it is located. If we compare this vision with the first (Zechariah 1:8-11), we shall see that the quiet there spoken of is here broken, and that the shaking of the nations, which is to accompany Messiah's advent (Haggai 2:7), has begun. That the four chariots are to be identified with the four powers of Daniel's visions (2 and 7.) - the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Macedonian, and Roman - is an opinion that does not commend itself. These four kingdoms and their fate have been already symbolized in the horns of the second vision (Zechariah 1:19-21), and it is most unlikely that they should be again introduced under a different figure. This would mar the orderly development of the revelation. And how could these kingdoms, such as they were, be said to issue from the seat of the theocracy and to be attentive to God's commands? Further, how could the chariots symbolize the kingdoms which were to be the objects of punishment, when at the same time they are themselves the instruments which inflict the chastisement? Neither does the angel's explanation suit this notion; for kingdoms are nowhere found under the figure of winds, and such a symbol would have been unintelligible to the prophet without further elucidation. Two mountains. The Hebrew has the article, \"the two mountains,\" two well known mountains. The scene of the vision is Jerusalem or its neighbourhood; hence the two mountains mentioned are thought to he those of Zion or the temple mount, and Olives (comp. Zechariah 14:4; Joel 3:16). It is impossible to identify them; end probably nothing more is meant than that the chariots came forth from a defile between the two mountains which appeared in the vision. Mountains of brass; or, copper. These impregnable, undecaying mountains represent the immovable, invincible nature of the theocracy and of God's decrees respecting it. From it the chariots go forth, because for the sake of God's kingdom and to promote its objects the world powers are destroyed (Knabenbauer) (Isaiah 66:15). The number \"four\" represents completeness; the judgment shall leave no quarter unvisited.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTIn the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - Red horses (see note on Zechariah 1:8).

The Vulgate has fortes; Aquila, καρτεροί. One would have expected a colour to be named. but why these are specially mentioned as strong or active is seen in ver. 7. The word beruddim, \"speckled,\" occurs only in Genesis 31:10, 12, where it has no symbolical character. As it denotes a combination of colours, probably spots of white on a dark ground, it may signify a quality of a mixed, nature, thus indicating a visitation of war and pestilence, the sword and famine.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?VERSEENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - The four spirits of the heavens. Both the Septuagint and Vulgate render, \"the four winds of heaven;\" and this is doubtless correct. It was a familiar symbol to the Jews. The winds are often introduced in executing God's will on sinners (comp. Psalm 104:4; Psalm 148:8; Jeremiah 49:36; Daniel 7:2). Which go forth from standing before the Lord (comp. Job 1:6; Job 2:1). The winds are supposed to be God's servants, waiting his pleasure to be sent forth on his errands. The Septuagint and Vulgate translate, \"which go forth to stand before the Lord.\" This denotes merely their usual obedience; but the text implies that the prophet sees them moving from their usual expectant attitude, and hastening forth to do God's commands.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - The angel now (vers. 6, 7) indicates the various destinations of the chariots, except the first with the red horses. Why this is omitted has never been satisfactorily explained. Some regard ver. 7 as giving the destination of this chariot, by making a slight change in the word rendered \"bay\" in the Authorized Version, which would cause it to mean \"red.\" The Syriac, indeed, which omits the word in ver. 3, translates it here by \"red.\" If we retain the Masoretic reading, we must let this difficulty remain unsolved, and suppose that the angel explains only part of the vision, leaving the rest for the prophet's meditation. The black horses which are therein; literally, that wherein are the black horses, they go forth, etc.; which is equivalent to \"the chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth.\" So the Revised Version. The north country. Babylonia (see note on Zechariah 2:6). After them; behind them. The white horses go to the same quarter; and thus is indicated the overwhelming destruction that was coming on Babylon, and the victory and triumph of the conquerors over it. The south country; i.e. Egypt (Isaiah 30:6; Daniel 11:5), another hostile power, also, perhaps, Edom and Ethiopia. One chariot only is seen to go towards it, drawn by the speckled horses that denote a mixed judgment, perhaps of war and pestilence (see on ver. 3). The north and south symbolize the whole earth and the powers hostile to the true Israel.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - The bay; rather, the strong, as in ver. 3; the horses in the fourth chariot, whose special mission needed peculiar powers. Septuagint, οἱ ψαροί: but the Vulgate, qui erant robustissimi. Sought to go. These agents desired a wider sphere, and asked permission to extend their action, and to walk to and fro through the earth. Famine and pestilence, which this chariot symbolizes, come at different times and in different places mysteriously and unexpectedly \"as arrows shot from the hand of God (Ezekiel 5:16) on the objects of his displeasure\" (Alexander). LXX., Καὶ ἐπέβλεπον [S2, Καὶ ἐζήτουν καὶ ἐπέβλεπον] τοῦ πορεύεσθαι τοῦ [Α, καὶ] περιοδεῦσαι τὴν γῆν, \"And looked to go and compass the earth.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - Then cried he upon me. The angel cried aloud (like a herald announcing a proclamation, Jonah 3:7), to call the prophet's attention to what was coming, which was of most immediate consequence to his people. This angel speaks as in the person of God. Have quieted my spirit; literally, have caused my spirit to rest; LXX., ἀνέπαυσαν τὸν θυμόν μου, \"quieted my anger,\" i.e. by satiating it. Many commentators take the clause as equivalent to \"have caused my wrath to rest upon the land\" (comp. John 3:36), referring to Judges 8:3; Proverbs 16:32; Ecclesiastes 10:4, for the use of the word \"spirit\" (ruach) in the sense of \"anger.\" Others see here an intimation of mercy and grace to the Jews still resident in Babylonia. But it is plain that the vision is one of judgment: and the Spirit of the Lord is a Spirit of judgment and vengeance (Isaiah 4:4), which destroys evil that good may flourish.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-15. - § 11. A symbolical action - the crowning of the high priest.

Came unto me. This was probably on the morning after the night of visions, or as soon as he had divulged them to the people.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTake of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - Take of them of the Captivity. The verb is in the infinitive for the imperative, \"take thou from the Captivity;\" what he is to take is noted in the next verse. \"Those of the Captivity\" are certain envoys sent by the Jews who still dwelt in Babylon (Ezekiel 1:1; Ezekiel 3:11), bearing gifts for the temple. These messengers the prophet was to visit at the house of Josiah, their host. Heldai; or, Cheldai, in ver. 14 \"Helem\" or \"Chelem,\" \"The Enduring One\" (Keil); \"The Lord's Word\" (Pussy). The name occurs in 1 Chronicles 27:15. Tobijah; \"The Lord is good,\" a well known name. Jedaiah; \"God careth.\" The name is found in 1 Chronicles 9:10; 1 Chronicles 24:7. The LXX. explains the names in symbolical fashion, Παρὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων καὶ παρὰ τῶν χρησίμων αὐτῆς καὶ παρὰ τῶν ἐπεγνωκότων αὐτήν \"From the chief men, and from its good men, and from those that have understood it.\" Which are come from Babylon. This clause in the Authorized Version is transposed from its place in the Hebrew, which is at the end of the verse, where it refers to the house of Josiah, and should be rendered, \"to which,\" or \"whither they have come from Babylon.\" Septuagint, Τὸν οϊκον Ὠσίου... τοῦ ἥκοντος ἐκ Βαβυλῶνος, \"The house of Josiah... who came from Babylon.\" The same day. There was to be no delay; the transaction was to be carried out \"on that day,\" the day made known to the prophet, and by himself in person. The house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. He was, perhaps, treasurer. At any rate, at his house the envoys were entertained, and there were stored the contributions which the Jews in exile had sent to their brethren in Jerusalem. Josiah is the same person as Hen, according to the Authorized Version and the Vulgate, in ver. 14 (where see note). He was probably son of the Zephaniah mentioned in 2 Kings 25:18 as in the second rank of priests among those who were deported to Babylon (comp. Jeremiah 21:1; Jeremiah 37:3).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThen take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Silver and gold. That which had been brought from Babylon. However unwilling the Jews were to let the Samaritans take part in the good work, they were quite ready to receive contributions from their brethren in the dispersion, and likewise from heathen kings and princes (see Ezra 6:8, etc.; Ezra 7:15, etc.). Make crowns. The prophet was to get the crowns made (comp. Exodus 25, passim). The plural may here be used intensively for \"a noble crown,\" as in Job 31:36; or it may signify the two metals of which the crown was made, two or more wreaths being intertwined to form it. It is certain that only one crown was to be made, and that that was to be placed on Joshua's head. There is no mention of Zerubbabel in the passage; so the plural cannot be taken to intimate that there was a crown for the high priest and a crown for the princely ruler, as Ewald and Bunsen assert. These critics, followed by Hitzig and Wellhausen, supply the passage thus: \"on the head of Zerubbabel and on the head of Joshua.\" Zerubbabel had no kingly position. Rather, all mention of Zerubbabel is expressly excluded, in order to denote that in the Person of him whom Joshua symbolized, the offices of priest and king were united (Psalm 110). We may note that in Revelation 19:12 Christ is said to have on his head many crowns, by which is meant a diadem composed of many circlets. The high priest's mitre is never called a crown. That which was placed on Joshua's head was a royal crown, a token of royal dignity, not his own, but his whom he represented - Christ the eternal Priest, the universal King.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - Speak unto him, saying. The prophet is to explain to Joshua the meaning of this public act. Behold the Man whose name is The BRANCH; literally, behold the man, BRANCH is his name (see note on Zechariah 3:8). The Targum has, \"Behold the Man, Messiah is his name.\" It is plain that the term \"Branch\" or \"Shoot\" (LXX., Ἀνατολή: Vulgate, Oriens) could not be addressed to Joshua; indeed, the very form of the sentence, \"his name,\" not \"thy name,\" shows this. All who saw the transaction and heard the words must have understood that they had reference to the \"Shoot\" of David, the Messiah that was to come, to whom was committed the regal and priestly dignity. And he shall grow up out of his place; Septuagint, Καὶ ὑποκάτωθεν αὐτοῦ ἀνατελεῖ, \"And item beneath him he shall spring up;\" Vulgate, Et subter eum orietur; Drake, \"He shall sprout forth from under himself;\" Revised Version margin, \"And it (or they) shall bud forth under him;\" Hitzig, Ewald, \"From under him there shall be sprouting.\" But them is no need to alter the rendering of the Authorized Version, which indicates that the shoot shall grow from its own soil, that Messiah shall arise in his own country and nation, and shall spring from a lowly origin to the highest glory (see Isaiah 11:1; Isaiah 53:2). He shall build the temple of the Lord. He should build, not the material temple whose foundations Zerubbabel had laid, but the spiritual temple of which the tabernacle and the temple of Jerusalem were only the type and shadow - that new sanctuary which Ezekiel beheld (41), a house not made with hands, the Church of the living God (Ephesians 2:20, etc.; 1 Peter 2:5).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTEven he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - Even he shall build. A forcible repetition of the preceding statement, laying stress on the Person, \"He, and no one else, shall build.\" The clause is omitted by the Septuagint. He shall bear the glory. The word rendered \"glory\" is used to denote royal honours here, as in 1 Chronicles 29:25; Jeremiah 22:18; Daniel 11:21. Messiah shall have regal majesty. Compare the many passages where the glory of Christ is spoken of; e.g. John 1:14; John 2:11; John 17:5; Luke 9:32; Luke 24:26; Hebrews 2:9; Revelation 5:12, etc. Shall sit and rule upon his throne (comp. Zechariah 9:10). Thus Christ says, \"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth\" (Matthew 28:18; see Luke 1:32). And he shall be a Priest upon his throne; Septuagint, Καὶ ἔσται ἱερεὺς ἐκ δεξιῶν αὐτοῦ, \"There shall be a Priest upon his right hand.\" The Authorized Version is doubtless correct, as the clause is intended to declare that Messiah should, like Melchizedek, combine the offices of Priest and King (Psalm 110:4; Hebrews 5:6, 10). The counsel of peace shall be between them both. The two offices or dignities are meant, which are combined in one person. The Messiah, in his two offices of Priest and King, has one common design, to bring peace to his people (Isaiah 9:6; Micah 5:5, where see note). Other interpretations are unsuitable. Thus: There shall be harmony between Joshua and Zerubbabel; but the two are nowhere mentioned together in the paragraph, and, indeed, the statement would be superfluous. There shall be perfect concord between the two offices; but a person is spoken cf. not an abstraction. Others explain the \"counsel of peace\" to be between Jews and Gentiles, or the returned and the exiled Jews; but neither of these have been named. Pusey takes it to mean, \"between the Father and the Son;\" but there is nothing in the passage to lead to this. Kuabenhauer expounds it of those who alone are mentioned in the text, Messiah and Joshua, seeing in it an exhortation to the latter to make the type correspond to the Antitype, so that all may see that there is perfect harmony between them.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The crowns shall be... for a memorial. The crown was to be taken from Joshua's head and deposited in the temple as a memorial of this prophecy, and of the zeal of those who had come from far to bring offerings to the Lord, and likewise of the hospitality of Josiah, who had received them into his house. That such \"gifts\" were dedicated in the temple is well known (see Judith 16:19; 2 Macc. 5:16 2Macc. 9:16; Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:17. 3; 'Ant.,' 17:06. 3; 19:6. 1; Philo, 'Legat. ad Cal.,' § 40, 2 p. 592). Helem is the same as Heldai (ver. 10), whether he bore both names, or whether, as is probable, this is a mere mistake of a copyist. To Hen. The Authorized Version considers this as a proper name. In this case it would be another name for Josiah. But it is really an appellative, and the rendering should be, \"for the kindness of the son of Zephaniah.\" The crown would be also a memorial of his kindness in receiving and entertaining these exiles (comp. Matthew 10:41). The LXX. explains the names as in ver. 10, though not quite in the same way, Ασται τοῖς ὑπομένουσι καὶ τοῖς χρησίμοις αὐτῆς καὶ τοῖς ἐπεγνωκόσιν αὐτὴν καὶ εἰς χάριτα υἱοῦ Σοφονίον καὶ εἰς ψαλμὸν ἐν οἴκῳ Κυρίου, \"The crown shall be to them that endure, and to its good men, and to those that have understood it, both for a favour to the son of Sophonias, and for a psalm in the house of the Lord.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah6:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

The Jews who had come from Babylon to Jerusalem are a figure of the conversion of distant nations and their offerings to the Church (see Haggai 2:7, and note there). Build in the temple of the Lord. They shall join in building up the spiritual temple, the universal Church of Christ. Ye shall know, etc. (Zechariah 2:9, 11; Zechariah 4:9). The Angel of Jehovah is speaking in Jehovah's name (ver. 9). What takes place in the case of this material temple shall be a token and a prelude of the great fulfilment in Messianic times. If ye will diligently obey. Neither the restoration of the temple nor the advent of Messiah's kingdom was in itself doubtful; but the people's share in the former, and their participation in the blessings of the latter, depended on the preparation of the heart, obedience, zeal, and holiness (Daniel 12:10; Malachi 4:1, 2; John 1:12; 2 Timothy 2:11, 12).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.7":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah7:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-ch. 8:23. - Part II. THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION CONCERNING THE OBSERVANCE OF CERTAIN FASTS. Verses 1-3. - § 1. A deputation comes from Bethel to ask whether a fast instituted in memory of the calamity of Jerusalem was still to be observed. Verse 1. - In the fourth year of King Darius. This happened, then, B.C. 518, nearly two years after the visions had occurred (Zechariah 1:7). In two years more the temple was finished (Ezra 6:15), and the work of rebuilding was now proceeding vigorously; it seemed a fit opportunity for inquiring whether, in this period of comparative prosperity and success, it behoved the people to continue the fast appointed in sadder times. The word of the Lord came. This is the usual formula for introducing a revelation (Zechariah 1:1), but it is here placed in a peculiar position, dividing the date into two parts. Keil connects the last clause, which gives the day of the month, with the next verse; but this is against the traditional accentuation, and is not required by the wording of ver. 2. The prophet first gives the date generally when the word came to him, and then defines it more accurately. Chisleu; Chislev (Nehemiah 1:1). This month corresponded to parts of November and December.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah7:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - When they had sent unto the house of God. The Vulgate supports this version, Et miserunt ad domum Dei; the LXX. gives, Καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν εἰς Βαιθὴλ Σαρασὰρ καὶ Ἀρβεσεὲρ ὁ βασιλεὺς καὶ οἱ ἄνδρες αὐτοῦ, \"And Sarasar and Arbescer the king and his men sent to Bethel\" - which is far from clear. But the temple is never called Beth-el, while a mission to the town Bethel would be unmeaning. So \"Bethel\" is to be taken as the subject of the sentence, thus: \"Now Bethel (i.e. they of Bethel) sent.\" The persons named may be taken either as the deputation or as the persons meant by \"they of Bethel.\" The former seems most likely to be intended. The Bethelites sent these men to Jerusalem to make the inquiry. The exiles returned each to his own city, as we read in Ezra it.; among them were many people of Bethel (Ezra 2:28; Nehemiah 7:32), which town they rebuilt (Nehemiah 11:31). They seem to have tacitly acquiesced in the spiritual supremacy of Jerusalem, notwithstanding the associations Connected with their own city. Sherezer. The names of the deputies are Assyrian; they seem to have retained them on their return. Sherezer, equivalent to Assyrian Sar-usur or Asur-sar-usur, \"Asur protect the King,\" is the name borne by a sen of Sennacherib (2 Kings 19:37). Regem-melech; \"Friend of the King.\" The first half of the word is probably Assyrian (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschr. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 206, 417). And their men. Certain persons associated with them in the business. To pray before the Lord; literally, to stroke the face of the Lord (Zechariah 8:21, 22; Exodus 32:11); so Latin, mulcere caput.

Such as Zechariah, Haggai, and perhaps Malachi, through whom God communicated his will. Should I weep in the fifth month? The use of the first person singular to express a community or a people is not uncommon; here it means the Bethelites (comp. Numbers 20:18, 19; Joshua 9:7; 1 Samuel 5:10, 11). Weeping is the accompaniment of fasting (Judges 20:26; Nehemiah 1:4; Joel 2:12). This fast in the fifth month, the month of Ab, had been established in memory of the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. The temple was burnt on the ninth or tenth of the month (see 2 Kings 25:8, 9; Jeremiah 52:12, 13). The only fast-day enjoined by the Law of Moses was the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month, Ethanim (Leviticus 23:26, etc.). But the Jews added others in memory of certain national events (see Judges 20:26; 1 Samuel 7:6; Isaiah 58:3, etc.). In Zechariah 8:19 mention is made of four extraordinary fasts instituted and observed during the Captivity, viz. on the ninth day of the fourth month, in memory of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; in the fifth month, in remembrance of the burning of the temple and city; in the seventh month, in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah (Jeremiah 41:1, 2); and in the tenth month, in memory of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (see note on ch. 8:19). Separating myself. Abstaining from food and pleasure. Vulgate, vel sanctificare me debeo, such separation or abstinence being regarded as a consecration to the Lord. The LXX. has not understood the passage, rendering, Αἰσελήλυθεν ῶδε ἐν τῷ μηνὶ τῷ πέπτῳ τὸ ἁγίασμα \"The sanctification hath come in here in the fifth month.\" These so many years.

The original question referred only to this fast; the answer embraces also another fast appointed by human authority. The seventh month. This fast was instituted in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah, B.C. 587, just seventy years ago, when the greater part of the remnant of the Jews, contrary to the prophet's warning, fled into Egypt to escape the punishment of the crime (2 Kings 25:25, 26; Jeremiah 41:2, 16, etc.). Did ye at all fast unto me? It was not by God's command, or to do him honor, that they fasted; not from hearty repentance or sorrow for the sins which had brought ruin upon their city and country; but from vexation at the calamity itself, and in a self-righteous spirit, with some idea of gaining merit by this punishment of the body; and God was not constrained by this formal observance to show them favour.

Septuagint, Κακίαν ἕκαστος τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ μὴ μνησικακείτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίας ὑμῶν, \"Let none of you remember in your hearts the malice of your brother.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah7:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - Pulled away the shoulder; they gave a stubborn, refractory shoulder, like an ox which refuses to have the yoke put on his neck, or draws hack when it feels the weight (Nehemiah 9:29; Hosea 4:16). Stopped their ears. Made their ears heavy. Τὰ ω΅τα αὐτῶν ἐβάρυναν (Septuagint); Isaiah 6:10; Isaiah 59:1. Three degrees of obduracy are named in this verse: they refused to listen; they resisted the warners; they exhibited open contempt for them. The full climax is given in the next verse.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah7:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - They made their hearts as an adamant stone. They made their hearts as hard as a stone which could receive no cutting or engraving; no message from God could find entrance; and this from their wilful obstinacy. The word rendered \"adamant,\" shamir, probably means \"diamond,\" a stone so hard, says Jerome, as to break all metals to pieces, but to be itself broken by none; hence it is called adamas, \"unconquerable.\" Ezekiel (Ezekiel 3:9) notes that it is harder than flint (comp. Jeremiah 17:1). The LXX., paraphrasing, gives. Τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν ἔταξαν ἀπειθῆ, \"They set their heart disobedient.\" The Law. The various enactments of the Mosaic system. In his Spirit; rather, by his Spirit. The leaching which the Spirit of God inspired the prophets to deliver (comp. Nehemiah 9:30; 2 Kings 17:13; Micah 3:8). And for the succession of prophets from Solomon to the Captivity, see note on Amos 2:11; and to those there enumerated, add Iddo, Shemaiah, Hanani, Micaiah, Huldah.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah7:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTherefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - As he cried. As the Lord called to them by the prophets. Just retribution fell upon them (Proverbs 1:24, etc.; Isaiah 65:12, 13; Isaiah 66:4). So they cried, and I would not hear; rather, so they shall cry, and I will not hear. God will be deaf to their cry, and will give them up to their own ways (Jeremiah 2:28). In the protasis Jehovah is spoken of in the third person, in the apodosis he speaks in the first.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah7:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - I scattered them; I will scatter them. What had happened in the past is a sign of what shall befall them in the future in punishment of like obduracy. The form of the sentence denotes that God is recounting what he had said to the people in past time; hence it is best to translate the verbs in the future tense. Scattered them with a whirlwind; Septuagint, ἐκβαλῶ αὐτούς, \"I will cast them out;\" Vulgate, dispersi eos (comp. Job 27:21; Amos 1:14). Nations whom they knew not. This is the usual phrase for people of strange tongue (Deuteronomy 28:33; Jeremiah 16:13). Thus the land was desolate. This was the result of God's threatenings. Some make the words of Jehovah continue to \"nor returned,\" but the punctuation is against them. After them; i.e. after they were carried away in captivity. No man passed through nor returned. No one went to and fro - a picture of extreme desolation (comp. Isaiah 33:8; Jeremiah 9:12; and for the phrase, see Zechariah 9:8; Ezekiel 35:7). For they laid the pleasant land desolate. The pronoun refers to the disobedient Jews, their sin being the cause of the desolation; or the verb may be taken impersonally, \"So the pleasant land was made desolate.\" \"The pleasant land\" is literally, \"the land of desire.\" Septuagint, γῆν ἐκλεκτήν (Psalm 106:24; Jeremiah 3:19).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.8":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAgain the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 1-8. - § 4.

This formula occurs ten times in this chapter, thus enforcing the truth that all the promises made to Zion come from the Lord himself, and are therefore sure to be fulfilled. I was jealous; - I am jealous, as Zechariah 1:14 (where see note). With great fury. Against her enemies (Zechariah 1:15). \"Zelus\" is defined by Albertus Magnus: \"amor boni cum indignatione contrarii.\" One side of God's love for Zion is shown in the punishment of her enemies. Knabenbauer likens this zeal or jealousy of God to the pillar of fire at the Exodus - light and protection to the Israelites, darkness and destruction to the Egyptians (Exodus 14:20).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - I am returned (Zechariah 1:16); I return. When Jerusalem was taken and given over to the enemy, God seemed to have deserted her (Ezekiel 10:18; Ezekiel 11:23); but new the restoration of the exiles, the rebuilding of the temple, the voice of prophecy, showed that the Lord had returned, and that new he will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem (Zechariah 2:10). A city of truth; city of truth; no longer full of lies and treachery and infidelity. God dwelling therein, it shall be \"the faithful city\" (Isaiah 1:26), in which all that is true and real shall flourish (comp. ver. 16; Zephaniah 3:13). The holy mountain. The hill whereon the temple is built shall be called the holy mountain, because the Lord dwelt in the sanctuary. The prophecy in this and the following verses received a partial fulfilment in the days between Zerubbabel and Christ; but there is a further accomplishment in store.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - There shall yet old men...dwell (sit), etc. A picture of happy security and plenty, in vivid contrast to the desolation deplored in Lamentations 2; Lamentations 5. In the days of the Maccabees it is noted, among other tokens of peace and prosperity, that \"the ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together of good things\" (1 Macc. 14:9). For very age; Hebrew, for multitude of days. People shall reach the utmost limits of human life. According to the old Law, length of days was the reward of obedience (Genesis 15:15; Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 4:40), and an early death was inflicted as a punishment of sin (Deuteronomy 28:20; Psalm 54:23; 78:33). Such promises are made also in Messianic times (Isaiah 65:20), though in a different sense.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Full of boys and girls.

The return of the captives from Babylon was a prelude of the future restoration of the dispersed, when all Israel shall be saved (Romans 11:26). (See a similar promise, Isaiah 43:5, 6; comp.

As the centre of worship (see Zechariah 2:4, and note there). In truth and in righteousness. The words belong to both parts of the preceding clause: God will deal truly and righteously with them, but they must deal truly and righteously with him. If they are faithful to their obligations, God would be unto them all that he had promised to be.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9-17. - § 5. The people are exhorted to be of good cheer, for god will henceforth give them his blessing, which, however, was conditional on their obedience. Verse 9. - Let your hands be strong (comp. Haggai 2:15-19). Be of good courage for the work before you (Judges 7:11; Isaiah 35:3; Ezekiel 22:14). By (from) the mouth of the prophets, which were. Who came forward as prophets. These prophets, who prophesied after the foundations of the temple were laid, were Haggai and Zechariah; they are thus distinguished from the pre-exilian seers mentioned in Zechariah 7:7. The same prophets who encouraged you in your work at first are they who have spoken to you words of promise in those days. That the temple might be built; Revised Version, even the temple that it might be built. This could not be predicated of the first foundation, which was followed by a long period of inaction (Ezra 4:24), only terminated by the vigorous exhortations of the prophets, which led to a resumption of the work that might be called a second foundation of the temple.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - The prophet reminds the people of the sad condition of affairs during the cessation of the good work, and how things began to improve directly they showed diligence and zeal. There was no hire for man, etc. Either the yield was so small that no labour of men or beasts was needed to gather it in, or the general poverty was so great that labourers could not get their wages nor the oxen their well earned share of provender (Haggai 1:11; Haggai 2:17, 18). Neither was there any peace...because of the affliction; rather, because of the adversary. They could not go about their usual occupations, or pass in safety from place to place, on account of the enemies that compassed them about (Ezra 4:4). The rendering of the Authorized Version is supported by the Septuagint and Vulgate, but the word (tsar) is often used for the concrete, \"adversary.\" So the Syriac here. I set all men every one against his neighbour. There were internal dissensions as well as outward opposition. God had allowed this for his own wise purposes.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBut now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 11. - But now I will not be. God's attitude towards the people had already changed in consequence of their diligence in the work of restoration. Perowne renders, \"Now I am not.\" The residue; the remnant; the returned Jews (ver. 12; Haggai 1:12). The former days. In the time of their inactivity, when a curse rested upon them and upon their land. The curse was now removed, and a marked amelioration had set in (Haggai 2:15-19).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The seed shall be prosperous; literally, (there shall be) the seed of peace. The crops sown shall be crops of peace, safe and secure, in contradistinction to the threat in Leviticus 26:16, that the seed should be sown in vain, for it should be devoured by an enemy (Knabenbauer). Or, more generally, all farming labours shall succeed and prosper. Jerome's paraphrase is, \"There shall be universal peace and joy;\" Septuagint,\" But I will show forth peace.\" Another way of understanding the words which has found much favour with modern commentators is to take the clause in apposition with the words immediately following; thus: \"The seed (i.e. growth) of peace, the vine, shall give its fruit.\" But there is no especial reason why the vine should be called \"the seed of peace.\" It is not peculiar among fruit trees for requiring a time of peace for its cultivation. And the term \"seed\" is very inappropriate to the vine, which was not raised from seed, but from cuttings and layers. Perowne also points out that such a rendering destroys the balance of the three following clauses, which explain and expand the general statement that agriculture shall prosper. Dr. Alexander takes \"the seed of peace\" to be that from which peace springs; i.e. that peace should be radically established in the land, and from this fact the results following should ensue. This affords a very good sense; but it is probably a metaphor quite unintended by the prophet. The Syriac reads differently, \"The seed shall be safe.\" The remnant (see on ver. 11). To possess; to inherit; Septuagint, κατακληρονομήσω (Revelation 21:7). This promise recalls the blessings in the old Law (Leviticus 26:4, etc.; Deuteronomy 33:28; Psalm 67:6).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - As ye were a curse among the heathen. As your fate was used as a formula of imprecation among the heathen; e.g. \"May your fate be that of the Jews\" (see examples of this, 2 Kings 22:19; Isaiah 65:15; Jeremiah 24:9; Jeremiah 29:22). The other way of taking the expression as meaning the object of curse (i.e. as the heathen once used to curse you), is not so suitable. Judah... Israel. This expression includes the twelve tribes, of all of which some members had returned, and continued to return, from the Captivity. They were united now and formed one nation (see note on Zechariah 9:10). So will I save you. In as open and significant a manner will I show that I am delivering and favouring you. Ye shall be a blessing. This must be taken correspondingly to the former phrase, being a \"curse;\" ye shall be used as a formula for blessing; e.g. \"God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh\" (Genesis 48:20; comp. Ruth 4:11, 12). Fear not (Zephaniah 3:16). \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\" (Romans 8:31; comp. Numbers 14:9). Let your hands be strong (see note on ver. 9). The LXX. takes the paragraph differently and erroneously: \"And it shall be that in like manner as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing,\" i.e. a cause of blessing, Ητε ἐν κατάρᾳ... ἔσεσθε ἐν εὐλογίᾳ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:14VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 14. - The ground of the prom[so is the will of God, who cannot deceive. As I thought to punish you; as I purposed to do evil to you; i.e. to the nation whose continuity is thus intimated (comp. Haggai 2:5; and for a similar contrast of punishment and blessing, see Jeremiah 31:25). I repented not. God carried out the dread decree to the full (Zechariah 1:6; 2 Chronicles 36:16). (For the phrase applied to God, comp. Numbers 23:19; Jeremiah 4:28; Jonah 3:10, where see note.) Vulgate, \"I pitied not.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:15VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTSo again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 15. - So again have I thought, etc. The past chastisement, which happened as it was threatened, is a guarantee of the fulfilment of the promised blessing. But there is a condition to be observed, which is set forth in the two next verses. The LXX. has, \"So have I ordered and purposed.\" In these special blessings Judah and Jerusalem alone were to share at the first; Israel's happy time (ver. 13) was to come later.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThese are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - These are the things. To secure the fulfilment of the promise of good, they must do the will of God (Zechariah 7:9. etc.). Truth. This was to be observed in all conversation and transactions with their neighbours. St. Paul quotes this injunction (Ephesians 4:25). Execute the judgment of truth and peace; literally, judge ye truth and the judgment of peace. So the Septuagint and Vulgate. Practise perfect equity in judgments, and so decide, according to truth and justice, as to secure peace and concord between the parties concerned. In your gates. Where the judges sat, and justice was administered (Deuteronomy 16:18; Deuteronomy 21:19; see note on Amos 5:10).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - Let none of you imagine (see note on Zechariah 7:10, where these words occur). Love no false oath. The prevalent sins at this time were not idolatry, but cheating and lying and injustice, vices learned in the land of exile, where they had turned their energies to traffic and commerce (see Zechariah 5:2-4, and note on ver. 3 there).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:18VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 18-23. - § 6. Here follows the direct answer to the question originally proposed. The fasts should be turned into joyful festivals, former calamities being forgotten. Then the change extending its influence, the heathen shall worship the God of Israel, and esteem it an honour to be received into fellowship with the Jewish nation.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:19VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 19. - The fast of the fourth month, etc. (For the occasions of these fasts, see note on Zechariah 7:3.) Jerome gives the later Jewish traditions concerning them. The fast of the seventh day of the fourth month commemorated the breaking of the two tables of the commandments by Moses, as well as the first breach in the walls of Jerusalem; that of the fifth month was observed in memory of the return of the spies sent to explore Canaan, and the consequent punishment of forty years' wandering in the wilderness, as well as of the burning of the temple by the Chaldeans; that in the tenth month was appointed because it was then that Ezekiel and the captive Jews received intelligence of the complete destruction of the temple. Joy and gladness. The observance of these fasts seems, by the Lord's answer, to have been neither enjoined nor forbidden; but as for their sins their festivals had been turned into mourning (Amos 8:10), so now their fasts should be turned into joyful feasts, and former miseries should be forgotten in the presence of the blessings now showered upon them. Therefore love the truth and peace. This is the condition of the fulfilment of the promise (ver. 16; Zechariah 7:9), here again forcibly impressed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:20VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 20. - It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people; peoples. The sight of the prosperity of the Jews shall induce surrounding nations to join in the worship of Jehovah. The same truth is expressed in Psalm 126:1-3. Perowne thinks that vers. 20, 21 refer to the tribes of Israel; but it seems unnatural to suppose the prophet asserting that it will yet happen that Israelites will seek the Lord, when there is no reason to think that they had not done so in some fashion, or that they would need the previous deliberation mentioned in the next verse. Many cities. So the LXX. and Vulgate. Others translate, \"great, or, populous cities;\" but this is less suitable.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:21VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 21. - The inhabitants of one city shall go to another. The LXX. has, \"The inhabitants of five cities shall go unto one;\" Vulgate, \"The inhabitants go one to another.\" Let us go speedily. The Hebrew is an imperfect followed by an infinitive absolute - an idiom which implies combination, Let us go on and on, continually. So Pusey and Wright. To pray before the Lord; to entreat the favour of the Lord (see note on Zechariah 7:2). The Gentiles would be moved, not only to make pilgrimages to the great annual festivals, but to seek to know the Lord, and how to worship him acceptably. I will go also. The inhabitants answer willingly to those who exhort them. It is quite unnatural to take the clause to mean (as Drake does), \"I, Zechariah, will go too, to see the alteration in the mode of observing these fast days.\"NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:22VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTYea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 22. - Many people (peoples) and strong nations. This explains ver. 20 more fully. The Jews were not actuated by the missionary spirit, yet even before Christ's advent their religion had spread into all parts of the world, as we see from the catalogue of proselytes in Acts 2:9-11. Intimations of the same fact are given in Ezra 6:21; Esther 8:17. To seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem; i.e. to keep the solemn festivals observed there (comp. Isaiah 2:2; Isaiah 66:20-23 Micah 4:1, and note there). The literal fulfilment of this prophecy is not to be looked for. It declares the future conversion of the Gentiles, and their being made one with Israel in the Church of Christ, \"one fold under one Shepherd\" (John 10:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah8:23VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 23. - Ten men. The number ten is used for a large indefinite number (comp. Genesis 31:7; Leviticus 26:26; 1 Samuel 1:8). Out of all languages (the languages) of the nations. The diversity of languages shall not hinder the unity in the faith (comp. Isaiah 66:18; Revelation 5:9; Revelation 7:9). Shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew. Taking hold of the skirt implies a desire to share the privileges, and to be united in fellowship with (comp. Isaiah 4:1; Haggai 2:12). St. Cyril considers the idea to be that the heathen shall cling to the Jews like children holding their fathers' dress for support and guidance. In \"the man that is a Jew\" St. Jerome discerns the Messiah. We will go with you. The picture presented to the mind by this verse is of a Jew journeying to Jerusalem from some distant country to keep a solemn festival, and a number of Gentiles clinging round him, asking permission to accompany him on his journey, because they have learned how good the Lord has been to his countrymen. But the ideal intended is much more than this. Salvation, indeed, is of the Jews; it began to be announced at Jerusalem; it was preached by the Jewish apostles; its founder was of the seed of David. But the true Israelites are not merely those who are of the natural posterity of Abraham, but all true Christians united under Christ, the Head. To their number all who would be saved must be joined (comp. Romans 4:11; Galatians 3:7, 29; Galatians 4:26, etc.).NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE","Zech.9":"PULPITSTARTPulpit CommentaryPULPITENDNEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:1VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTThe burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 1-ch. 14:21. - Part III.

Verse 1. - The burden (see note on Nahum 1:1). (On the circumstances connected with this prophecy, see Introduction, § I.) Destructive critics attribute ch. 9-11, to an anonymous prophet, whose utterances have been by mistake appended to the genuine work of Zechariah. We have given reasons for disputing this conclusion in the Introduction, § II. In (upon) the land of Hadrach. This expression is found nowhere else, and has occasioned great trouble to the commentators. But Assyrian inscriptions have cleared away the difficulty, and shown that it was the name of a city and district near Damascus, called in the monuments Hatarakha or Hatarika (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr. und das Alt. Test,' p. 453). Expeditions against this place are mentioned as occurring in various years, e.g. B.C. 772. 765, 755 (see G. Smith, 'Assyrian Canon,' pp. 46, etc., 63; 'Records of the Past,' 5:46; Schrader, pp. 482, 484, etc., 2nd edit.). Damascus shall be the rest thereof. The \"burden\" shall light upon Damascus in wrath, and settle there (comp. Ezekiel 5:13). This district should be the first to suffer. The LXX. has, Καὶ Δαμασκοῦ θυσία αὐτοῦ, \"In the land of Sedrach and Damascus is his sacrifice.\" When the eyes of man, etc.; literally, for to Jehovah (is, or will be) the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel. This gives the reason why Hadrach and Damascus are thus united. Because Jehovah has his eye on men and on Israel. Septuagint, \"because the Lord looketh upon men\" (comp. Zechariah 4:10; and ver. 8 below). We may then translate, \"For to Jehovah is an eye over man,\" etc. He sees their evil doings and their oppression of Israel, and therefore the judgment falls upon them (comp. Jeremiah 32:19). The Authorized Version intimates a conversion of the Gentiles, of which, however, the context says nothing: and there is no sense in saying that judgment shall fall upon a particular nation when, or because, the eyes of all men look to the Lord. Wright explains thus: When the wrath of God falls on Damascus, the eyes of the heathen, as well as those of Israel, will look to the Lord, and they will marvel at the judgment and the close fulfilment of the prediction. This would be a very sound and probable exposition of the passage if the expression, \"the eye of man being towards Jehovah,\" can mean that man marvels at his doings. All the tribes of Israel. God watches over them to guard them from evil (Deuteronomy 11:12; Ezra 5:5; Psalm 33:18).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:2VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 2. - And Hamath also shall border thereby; Revised Version, and Hamath also which bordereth thereon. Hamath, which is near unto Damascus, shall share in the Divine judgment. The Authorized Version probably means that Hamath shall be the companion of Damascus in punishment. (For Hamath, see note on Amos 6:2.) These Syrian towns, as well as those below in Phoenicia and Philistia, shall be visited, because they were all once included in the territory promised to Israel (see Genesis 15:18; Exodus 23:3l; Numbers 34:2-12; Deuteronomy 11:25; and comp. 2 Samuel 8:6, etc.; 1 Kings 4:21; 1 Kings 8:65; 2 Kings 14:25). The judgment was inflicted by Alexander the Great after the battle of Issus, B.C. 333, when Damascus was betrayed into his hands and plundered of all its enormous treasures. Tyrus and Zidon. Tyre was taken after a siege of seven months, its walls were demolished, its houses burnt, ten thousand of its defenders were massacred, the women and children sold as slaves; and it never rose to greatness again. Zidon, originally the chief city of the country, had long been eclipsed by its daughter, Tyre: it submitted to Alexander without a struggle. Though it be very wise; or, because she is very wise. The pronoun refers to Tyre, the mention of Zidon being, as it were, parenthetical. In spite of, or because of, its boasted wisdom, Tyre should suffer heavy punishment. The wisdom of Tyre is spoken of in Ezekiel 28:3, 4. Wright, as the LXX., makes the clause refer to both cities, \"though they be very wise.\" Vulgate, Assum pserunt quippe sibi sapientiam valde.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:3VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 3. - Tyrus (Zor) did build herself a stronghold (mazor). Wright endeavours to imitate the parouomasia, \"Tyre built for herself a tower.\" It was in her strong fortifications and her amassing of riches that Tyre showed her worldly wisdom. The city was built partly on the mainland, and partly on an island nearly half a mile distant, which rose abruptly out of the water in rocky precipices, and was surrounded with walls a hundred and fifty feet high. The insular portion of the town was that which so long mocked the Macedonian's utmost efforts, which were only successful when he had united the island to the mainland by erecting an enormous mole between them. This causeway has now become an isthmus of some half mile in width, owing to accumulations of sand and debris. As the dust (comp. 2 Chronicles 9:27; Job 27:16).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:4VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTBehold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 4. - Will cast her out; will take possession of her; i.e. will conquer her by the hands of her enemies, as Joshua 8:7; Joshua 17:12. Septuagint, κληρονομήσει, \"will inherit;\" Vulgate, possidebit; Ewald and Hitzig render, \"will impoverish her.\" Will smite her power in the sea. \"Power\" here includes all that made Tyre proud and confident - her riches, her fleets, her trade, her fortifications. God declares that she shall be smitten there as she stood in the midst of the sea, which formed her bulwark, and which should soon dash over her ruins. The LXX. translates, \"shall smite into the sea.\" Zechariah seems here to have a reminiscence of Ezekiel 27:32, \"What city is like Tyres, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?\" (comp. Ezekiel 26:4). With fire (comp. Amos 1:10). The city was burned by Alexander (see note on ver. 2. The siege is narrated by Arrian, 2:15-24; Quint. Curt., 4:2, etc.; Diod. Sic., 17:46, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:5VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAshkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 5. - Ashkelon shall see it. The ruin of so mighty a city as Tyre naturally filled neighbouring people with dismay. The prophet directs his attention to Philistia, and threatens its chief cities. The cities are enumerated in the same order as in Jeremiah 25:20. Gath is omitted, as in Amos 1:6-8 and Zephaniah 2:4:. It seems never to have recovered its destruction by Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6). (For Ashkelon, Gaza, and Ekron, see note on Amos 1:6.) Her expectation shall be ashamed. The hope of aid from Tyre shall not be fulfilled. After the fall of Tyre, Alexander continued his march southwards towards Egypt, subduing the cities on his way. The siege of Gaze delayed him some months; and when it was taken, it shared the treatment of Tyre. Its governor, one Batis, a eunuch, was tied alive to the conqueror's chariot, and dragged round the walls, in cruel imitation of the fate of Hector. The king shall perish from Gaza. No particular king is meant; but the prediction says that henceforward no king should reign in Gaze. In contrast with the Eastern policy of allowing conquered nations to retain their own rulers as tributary sovereigns, Alexander always deposed or slew reigning monarchs, and consolidated his empire by replacing them with governors of his own. The various chastisements are meted out by the prophet among the various cities, though they equally apply to all.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:6VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 6. - A Bastard. The word (mamzer) occurs in Deuteronomy 23:2 (3, Hebrew), where it may possibly mean \"a stranger.\" It is generally considered to signify one whose birth has a blemish in it - one born of incest or adultery. In Deuteronomy the LXX. renders, ἐκ πόρης, \"one of harlot birth;\" here, ἀλλογενής, \"foreigner.\" The Vulgate has separator, which is explained as meaning either the Lord, who as Judge divides the just from the unjust, or the Conqueror, who divides the spoil and assigns to captives their fate. Here it doubtless signifies \"a bastard race\" (as the Revised Version margin translates); a rabble of aliens shall inhabit Ashdod, which shall lose its own native population. The Targum explains it differently, considering that by the expression is meant that Ashdod shall be inhabited by Israelites, who are deemed \"strangers\" by the Philistines. Ashdod (see note on Amos 1:8). The pride. All in which they prided themselves. This sums up the prophecy against the several Philistine cities. Their very nationality shall be lost.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:7VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 7. - Personifying Philistia, the prophet declares that she shall cease to practise idolatry, and shall be incorporated in Israel. I will take away his blood out of his mouth. This refers to the practice of drinking the blood of sacrifices as an act of worship, or of eating the victims with the blood - a practice strictly forbidden to the Israelites (see Leviticus 3:17; Leviticus 7:26; Leviticus 17:10, 12; and comp. Genesis 9:4). Abominations. Sacrifices offered to idols, and afterwards eaten. The two clauses intimate the entire abolition of idolatry. Many see in this prediction a reference to the doings of the Maccabees; how, e.g., Judas destroyed the altars and idols in Azotus (1 Macc. 5:68); Jonathan again took that city, and burned it and the neighbouring towns, and, besieging Ashkelon, was received with great honour by the inhabitants, and confirmed in the possession of this place and Ekron (1 Macc. 10:84, etc.); and Simon stormed Gaza (? Gazara, a place near Ashdod), cleansed the houses of idols, \"put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the Law\" (1 Macc. 13:47, 48). But though such events partially fulfil the prophecy, the seer looks forward to a greater issue, and in these comparatively petty details beholds the working of the great principle that all nations shall be subdued to the faith. He that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God; better, he too shall be left (or, a remnant) for our God. The Philistine shall become a choice and elect remnant unto the God of the Israelites, and no longer regarded as alien and impure. As a governor; Septuagint, χιλίαρχος, \"head over a thousand.\" which the word alluph means (Zechariah 12:5, 6). It is used of the chiefs of Edom in Genesis 36:15, 16, etc., where the Authorized Version gives \"dukes.\" The tribes of Israel were divided into thousands, consisting of families, each of which was held together by closer affinities than the mere tribal bond (see note on Micah 5:2). The meaning is that the Philistine shall be admitted into the commonwealth of Israel as one of her chiefs. Ekron as a Jebusite. \"Ekron\" is equivalent to \"the Ekronite,\" who again stands in the place of all the Philistines. The Jebusites were the ancient possessors of Zion, who held their position till the days of David, and, when at last conquered by him (2 Samuel 5:6, etc.), were incorporated into his nation, and, as we may infer from Araunah's conduct, adopted his religion (2 Samuel 24:22; 1 Chronicles 21:23). God promises here that the Philistines, like the Jebusites, shall be absorbed into the Jewish Church. Mr. Drake ('Speaker's Commentary,' in loc.) curiously renders, \"He shall be as Eleph (Joshua 18:28) in Judah, and Ekron as Jebusi,\" explaining that the cities of Philistia were to be incorporated into Judaea. The conquests of Alexander conduced to the conversion of the heathen and their reception into the Church of God; and the general principle enunciated by all the prophets was tiros abundantly confirmed. But it is rot easy to discover the exact historical fulfilment of the latter part of this prophecy, concerning the merging of the Philistines in the Jewish nation. Josephus ('Ant.,' 13:15. 4) tells us that, about B.C. 100, the Jews held most of their cities, destroying some whose inhabitants refused to become proselytes. In the time of our Lord, by reason of intermarriage and social intercourse, the Philistines had ceased to be regarded as a separate nation; and a little later Philistia, far from being considered as alien and hostile, under the form Palestine, gave its name to the whole country. Christianity, too, made rapid progress in this district, so that the psalmist's words received herein a fulfilment, \"Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Gush; this one was born there\" (Psalm 87:4).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:8VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 8. - While the heathen world suffers the judgment of God, he protects his own people. I will encamp about (for the protection of) my house. God's house, or family, is the kingdom and Church of Israel, as Hosea 8:1. Septuagint, Υποστήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ μου ἀνάστημα, \"I will erect a fortification for my house.\" Because of the army. It may also be translated \"against,\" or \"from;\" i.e. to defend it from the hostile army. Others, pointing differently, render, \"as a garrison,\" or \"rampart.\" Because of (against) him that passeth by, etc. Against all hostile attacks. The phrase, \"him that passeth by and him that returneth,\" is used of an enemy making incursions, or attacking at various points (see note on Zechariah 7:14). The Vulgate gives the whole clause thus: Circumdabo domum meam ex his, qui militant mihi euntes et revertentes, \"I will defend my house with a guard chosen from those who serve me and do my will,\" i.e. angels. But this seems far from the signification of the Hebrew. Pusey restricts the meaning to the proceedings of Alexander, who passed by Judaea on his way to Egypt, and returned by the same route, without doing any injury to Jerusalem. Here comes in the Talmudic story related by Josephus ('Ant.,' 11:08). The Jews \"repaid the protection of Persia with a devoted loyalty, which prompted them to refuse the demand of submission made by Alexander during the siege of Tyre. He marched to chastise them after the fall of Gaza, and the beautiful city had already risen before his view on the hill of Zion, when he found the high priest Jaddua waiting his approach at the watch station of Sapha, clad in his robes of gold and purple, and followed by a train of priests and citizens in pure white. The conqueror bowed in reverence to the Holy Name upon the high priest's frontlet; and, being asked by Parmenio the reason of his conduct, said that in a dream at Dium, he had seen the God of Jaddua, who encouraged him to pass over into Asia, and promised him success. Then entering Jerusalem, he offered sacrifice in the temple, heard the prophecy of Daniel about himself; and granted certain privileges to all the Jews throughout his empire. The desire to honour a shrine so celebrated as, the Jewish temple is quite in accordance with the conduct of Alexander at Ilium and Ephesus, Gordium and Tyre. The privileges he is said to have conferred upon the Jews were enjoyed under his successors, and some minor matters have been adduced in confirmation of the story. On the other hand, the classical writers are entirely silent on the subject, and the details of Josephus involve grave historical inconsistencies. It seems not an unreasonable conjecture that the story is an embellishment of some incident that occurred when the high priest came to Gaza to tender the submission of the Jews. But we must not dismiss it without a remark on the vast influence which the conquests of Alexander had in bringing the Jews into closer relations with the rest of Asia, and so preparing them to fulfil their ultimate destiny as Christians\" (P. Smith, 'History of the World,' 1:60, etc). Oppressor. The word is used for \"taskmaster\" in Exodus 3:7. Septuagint, ἐξελαύνων, \"one who drives away;\" Vulgate, exactor. This latter rendering would imply that Israel would no longer have to pay tribute to foreign nations, but should henceforward be independent. For now have I seen with mine eyes. It is as though, during Israel's calamities, God had not looked upon her; but now he notices her condition, and interposes for her succour (comp. Exodus 2:25; Exodus 3:7, 9; Acts 7:34). This is done by sending the personage mentioned in the following section.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:9VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTRejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 9, 10. - § 2. Then shall the righteous King come to Zion in lowly fashion, and inaugurate a kingdom of peace. Verse 9. - The prophet invites Jerusalem to rejoice at the coming of the promised salvation in the Person of her King; no mighty earthly potentate and conqueror, like Alexander the Great, but one of different fashion (comp. Zephaniah 3:14). Thy King cometh unto thee. St. Matthew (Matthew 21:5) and St. John (John 12:15) see a fulfilment of this prophecy in Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem on the first day of the week in which he was crucified. All attempts to disprove the Messianic import of this passage have been unavailing. Even critics who refer this part of Zechariah (ch. 9-11.) to an unknown author writing in the time of Hezekiah, allow that it is replete with Messianic ideas, and can be applied to no hero of Jewish story or event of Jewish history. There is no other \"King\" of Israel to whom it can refer. Our blessed Lord himself, by his abnormal actions on Palm Sunday, plainly assumed the part of the predicted King, and meant the people to recognize in him the promised Messiah (see the full discussion of the subject in Dr. Pusey's notes, pp. 556, etc.). Thy King. A king of thine own race, no stranger, but one predestined for thee. He who was foretold by all the prophets, who was to occupy the throne of David, and reign forever (Psalm 2:6; Psalm 45:1, 6, 7; Isaiah 32:1). Unto thee. For thy good, to bless thee (Isaiah 9:6). Just. Righteous in character and in practice, ruling in equity (Psalm 72:1-4, 7; Isaiah 11:2-4). Having salvation; Septuagint, σώζων, \"saving.\" Vulgate, salvator; so the Syriac and Chaldee. The genius of the language requires the participle to be taken passively, as it is in two other passages where it occurs (Deuteronomy 33:29; Psalm 33:16). The context has seemed to some to demand that it be understood in an active sense, thus contrasting him who came to save with the haughty Grecian conqueror, whose progress was marked by bloodshed. But the usual meaning of the word affords a satisfactory sense. The King who comes is \"saved,\" endowed with salvation, either as being protected and upheld by God (Psalm 18:50; Psalm 110:1, 2, 5; Isaiah 42:1; Isaiah 49:8), or as being victorious and so able to aid his people. In this latter view, the active sense is included in the passive. His own deliverance is a sure sign of the deliverance of his people. Lowly; Septuagint, πραύς, \"meek;\" Vulgate, pauper - meek and lowly, as Christ himself says (Matthew 11:29),far removed from warlike pomp and worldly greatness. The word is also rendered \"afflicted,\" and would then be in accordance with the description in Isaiah 52:13-53:5; Psalm 22:6. Riding upon an ass. In illustration of his poor or afflicted estate; it is this, and not merely the peace. fulness of his reign, that is meant by this symbolical action, as we see by the following clause, where the youthfulness of the animal is the point enforced. And (even, and that) upon a colt the foal of an ass; such as she asses bear, and one not trained; as the evangelist says, \"whereon never man sat.\" Christ sat upon the foal. In old times judges and men of distinction rode upon asses (Genesis 22:3; Judges 5:10; Judges 10:4); but from Solomon's days the horse had been used, not only in war, but on all state occasions (Jeremiah 17:25); and the number of horses brought back on the return from Babylon is specially mentioned (Ezra 2:66). So to predicate of a King that he would come to his capital riding, not on a war horse, but on a young, unbroken ass, showed at once that he himself was not to be considered a victorious general or a worldly potentate, and that his kingdom was not to be won or maintained by carnal arms. This is signified more fully in the following verse, which describes the character and extent of Messiah's kingdom.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:10VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 10. - I will cut off the chariot. All the apparatus of war will be removed, Messiah's rule being not established by physical force, or maintained by military defences. The Jews seem to have used war chariots from the time of Solomon, who, we are told, had fourteen hundred of them (1 Kings 10:26). Ephraim...Jerusalem. The former term denotes the kingdom of the ten tribes; the latter, that of Judah; the two together comprising the whole Israelite nation. From the use of these terms here it cannot be concluded that the author wrote at a time when the two kingdoms existed side by side. In the first place, the description of the whole people is given poetically, and must not be taken to have more significance than is intended; and secondly, in ch. 8:13, which is confessedly post-exilian, the \"house of Judah,\" and the \"house of Israel\" are distinguished. Dr. Cheyne notes, too, that in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28), who prophesied during the Captivity, the ten tribes are distinguished by the name of Ephraim, and pertinently asks why such term may not be also used by one who wrote after the Captivity. The battle bow stands for all weapons of war. That Messiah's kingdom should be peaceful and peace-bringing, see the prophecies (Psalm 72:7; Isaiah 2:4; Isaiah 9:4-7; comp. Micah 5:10, 11). He shall speak peace unto the heathen. He will extend this peace to all the world, teaching the heathen to receive his spiritual rule, to compose their differences, to lay aside their arms, and live as one united family (comp. Ephesians 2:17). From sea even to sea. Geographically, the phrase means from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, as in Exodus 23:31 and Psalm 72:8, from whence our passage is derived. Poetically, an Eastern sea, perhaps, is supposed to bound that side of the earth. From the river even to the ends of the earth. From the Enphrates unto the utmost limits of the world (see Amos 8:12; Micah 7:12). Both expressions obtain an unlimited significance, and show the universal extent of Messiah's kingdom; for in him, according to the promise made to Abraham, all the families of the earth should be blessed.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:11VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAs for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerses 11-17. - § 3. All Israel, united into one people, shall wage successful war against adversaries, and attain to high glory, and increase largely in numbers. Verse 11. - As for thee also. The prophet addresses the daughter of Zion, the covenant people (comp. vers. 10, 13). \"Also\" is inserted to intimate that this deliverance is given in addition to the blessings promised in the two preceding verses. All who are living far from their native Zion are invited to come to her and partake of her good things. By (because of) the blood of thy covenant. The covenant is that made at Sinai, sealed and ratified by blood (Exodus 24:4-8), which still held good, and was the pledge to the nation of deliverance and help. This was a token of that everlasting covenant sealed with the blood of Christ, by which God's people are delivered from the bondage of sin (comp. Matthew 26:28; Hebrews 9:15; Hebrews 10:14-23; Hebrews 13:20). I have sent forth; I send forth - the prophetic perfect. The Greek and Latin Versions render, \"thou sentest forth,\" not so correctly. Thy prisoners. Those members of the nation who were still oppressed or captives in foreign lands, as Babylon and Egypt (comp. Obadiah 1:20; Joel 3:6, etc.; Amos 1:6, 9, etc.). The pit wherein is no water. \"Pit,\" or cistern, is a common name for a prison (Genesis 40:15; Exodus 12:29; Jeremiah 37:16). The absence of water may be notified either to imply that the tortures of thirst were added to the horror of the situation, or to intimate that the prisoners were not hopelessly drowned therein. We Christians see in this paragraph a figure of the redemption of a lost world by the blood of Christ.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:12VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTTurn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 12. - The prophet calls on the prisoners to avail themselves of the offered deliverance. Turn you to the stronghold. Return ye to Zion, the city defended by God (Zechariah 2:5), and able to afford you a safe asylum. (For the spiritual meaning, see Luke 4:18-21.) Ye prisoners of hope. Captives who have good hope of deliverance because they are still in covenant with God. Septuagint, δέσμιοι τῆς συναγωγῆς, \"prisoners of the synagogue.\" Pusey remarks that \"hope\" here and nowhere else has the article, and that what is meant is \"the Hope of Israel,\" that of which St. Paul spoke (Acts 26:6, 7 and Acts 28:20). Even today. In spite of all contrary appearances. Septuagint, ἀντὶ μιᾶς ἡμέρας παροικεσίας σου, \"for one day of thy sojourning.\" Double. A double measure of blessing in compensation for past suffering (Isaiah 40:2; Isaiah 61:7). There ought to be a full stop at the end of this verse, as in the Revised Version.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:13VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTWhen I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 13. - The Lord proceeds to explain the promised blessings in detail. First is signified the victorious resistance of the Maccabees against the Seleucidae - a figure of Messiah's victory over all the enemies of God. When (for) I have bent Judah for me. The verbs are in the prophetical perfect, and may be rendered future By a grand figure God is represented as a warrior armed for battle, who uses his people for the weapons of his warfare. The Hebrews speak of \"treading\" the bow, where we say \"bend,\" because they used the foot in bending it. In the present case Judah is God's bow. Filled the bow with Ephraim. Ephraim is the arrow (comp. Psalm 127:4, 5). Judah and Ephraim, the united people, are God's instruments, and fight against the world power in his strength. And raised up; better, and I will stir up; Septuagint, ἐξεγερῶ: Vulgate, suscitabo. Greece; Javan. Not a vague term for the tar west, whither some prisoners had been carried, but to be taken strictly as the appellation of Greece. Nothing but inspiration could have enabled Zechariah and Daniel to foresee the rise of the Macedonian dynasty, and the struggle between the Jews and the Syro-Grecian power in Maccabean times, which is here plainly announced. The earlier the date assigned to this part of Zechariah's prophecy, the more incredible is it that any mere human sagacity or prescience should have enabled a man to fore. tell these events, or to see in Greece a power arrayed in conflict with the people of God. And made thee; rather, and I will make thee.

God's arrows are the judgments which he inflicts upon his enemies, which come forth suddenly as the lightning flash, and cannot be avoided (Psalm 18:14; Habakkuk 3:11). Shall blow the trumpet. As the signal of battle and calamity (Numbers 10:9; Judges 7:19, 20; Ezekiel 7:14; Amos 3:6; Zephaniah 1:16). Whirlwinds of the south. He shall come upon the enemy and sweep them away with irresistible force. Storms from the south were the most violent, coming from the Arabian desert (Job 37:9; Isaiah 21:1; Hosea 13:15).

There are numerous examples, in the Books of Maccabees, of God's special interposition in his people's favour, and thus far and in part fulfilling this prophecy (see 1 Macc. 3:16-24 1 Macc. 4:6-16 1 Macc. 7:40-50; 2 Macc. 2:21, 22 2Macc. 3:24, etc.; 5:2-4; 11:8; 12:11,15, 22, 28, 37; 15:7, etc.). They shall devour. The prophet seems to have had in view Numbers 23:24, where Israel is compared to a lion, eating of the prey and drinking the blood of the slain. So here he says they shall \"devour,\" i.e. the flesh of their enemies (comp. Micah 5:8). Subdue with sling stones. So the Vulgate, and virtually the Septuagint, taking the case of the noun as instrumental; but it is best to take it as accusative of the object, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, \"They shall tread down the stones of the sling.\" The \"slingstones\" are the enemies, as in the next verse \"the stones of a crown\" are the Jews; and the sentence means that the Jews shall tread their enemies underfoot like spent slingstones, which are of no account. Or it may signify simply and without metaphor that they shall despise the enemies' missiles, which shall fall harmless among them (Job 41:28, 29). They shall drink the blood of the slain, like lions. Make a noise. As men exhilarated with wine. Vulgate, Bibentes inebriabuntur quasi a vino (Isaiah 49:26; Ezekiel 39:17-19). Shall be filled like bowls. They shall be filled with blood like the sacrificial vessels in which the blood of victims was received (Zechariah 14:20). The corners of the altar. The blood was also sprinkled on the corners or sides of the altar (Leviticus 1:5, 11; Leviticus 3:2). There may be included the notion that the war against God's enemies was a sacred war, and accepted by him as a sacrifice. In the Maccabean struggle the bloodshed was often very considerable (see 1 Macc. 7:32, 46 1 Macc. 11:47; 2 Macc. 8:30 2Macc. 10:17, 23, 31, etc.).NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:16VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTAnd the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 16. - Shall save them. He shall give them a positive blessing beyond mere deliverance from enemies. Keil, \"Shall endow them with salvation.\" As the flock of his people; so the Vulgate; literally, as a flock, his people; Septuagint, ὡς πρόβατα, λαὸν αὐτοῦ. He will tend his people as a shepherd tends his flock (Psalm 77:20; Psalm 100:3; Jeremiah 23:1; Ezekiel 34:2, 8, etc.), So Christ calls himself the \"good Shepherd,\" and his followers \"little flock\" (John 10:11; Luke 12:32). Stones of a crown. The valuable gems set in crowns and diadems, or in the high priest's official dress. The people shall be in God's sight as precious as these in the eyes of men, and shall be highly exalted. The Septuagint and Vulgate render, \"sacred stones;\" and Knabenbauer thinks that by the term is meant the temple of God, which shall arise or shine in the Holy Laud, as a reward for its faithful defence. But the sense given above is satisfactory and simpler. Lifted up as an ensign upon his land; better, as the Revised Version margin, glittering upon his land. \"His\" may refer to Jehovah, or Israel; probably the latter is meant. The \"land\" is the crown or diadem in which the precious stones, the redeemed people, are set. They shall be raised to the highest possible glory and honour. If the words be taken in the sense of \"raised on high over his land,\" they must be considered to indicate that the crown which contained the gems shall be raised aloft in victorious triumph.NEWLINEVERSETITLESTARTZechariah9:17VERSETITLEENDNEWLINEVERSESTARTFor how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.VERSEENDNEWLINEVerse 17. - His goodness. The goodness, i.e. the prosperity, of Israel or the land. Revised Version margin, \"their prosperity.\" If the affix \"his\" is referred to Jehovah, the nouns \"goodness\" and \"beauty\" must be taken, not as his attributes, but as gifts bestowed by him, the prosperity and beauty which he confers. But it is more suitable to the context to consider the reference to be to the people, who in the next clause are divided into young men and maidens, and to take the \"goodness,\" or goodliness, as appertaining more especially to the former, and the \"beauty\" to the latter. His beauty (comp. Ezekiel 16:14). (For the Messianic interpretation, see Psalm 45:2; Isaiah 33:17.) Corn...new wine. This is an expression often found to denote great abundance and prosperity. The two are distributed poetically between the youths and maidens (Deuteronomy 33:28; Psalm 72:16; Jeremiah 31:12, 13; Joel 2:18, 19). Make...cheerful; literally, make sprout. It probably refers to the increase of population occurring in times of plenty. This outward prosperity is a symbol of God's favour and the uprightness of the people. In these things, too, we may see adumbrated the spiritual blessings of the gospel, which are, as corn and wine, to strengthen and refresh the soul.NEWLINENEWLINENEWLINENEWLINE",
